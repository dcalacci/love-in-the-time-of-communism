In any event, Mr. Hathaway-he was then to me just Mr. Hathaway. I didn't know him. I didn't attend this particular forum, because I think I was possibly 19 or 20, and I was interested in football and boxing, occasionally in studies, and always in girls, and I had no political interests at the time. Hathaway came down and spoke, in any event, and a group of athletes-I was not among the group-a group of athletes went in to break up that meeting. They were pretty rugged boys, and I know it. I fought with them on the team and played around with them and so forth, and they were pretty rugged boys, and they went in and they broke up the Hathaway meeting, and they threw out Hathaway, and managed to get into fights with those that were in attendance. I heard about the incident. I wasn't anywhere around it, but I heard about it, and I was worried about it; I didn't like mob action, and I felt that this was an injustice. I felt that the boys had acted incorrectly, that they had discredited the university, and I spoke about that to many people. Let's put it this way: I have always been articulate to some extent, and I spoke about it to many people. I thought at the time and still think that you have got to do some thinking about the world you live in. I didn't even know there was such a thing at that time. I don't believe that I was aware of the existence of the Communist Party, as such, and I am not even sure that the persons who talked to me were Communists, but we talked about Marxism. \x0c384 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA And they talked about socialism, and so forth. They handed me pamphlets and they talked and they talked and they talked. It began to condition me-let me place the year. The year was, I believe, 1933. It was very easy in 1933 to be conditioned in the direction of socialism. As a matter of fact, I might say the people I talked to in regard to my appearance here today, if as many people voted for Norman Thomas in 1932 as they assured me they did, I think he won, and the votes were stalled. In any event, this was 1933 or 1934. I don't recall the exact year. My feelings began then in the direction of the various pamphlets, books, and so forth that I was handed, and I thumbed through.", ' In 1944, during the summer of 1944, just before that, at the end of 1943 my family had learned officially of the death of my brother in action. He was a B-17 chauffeur in the Mediterranean, action over the Mediterranean. I was quite disturbed by this time. All my brothers were in action, and I wanted to be. I was quite disturbed at the time, I think, over the going of the war; and, like countless millions of Americans, I was praying for every possible victory that the Russians could have. They put up a fine defense at Stalingrad and had impressed the world. In 1944 I was working at RKO Studios, at the time that Henry Wallace was still Vice President of the United States and was up for renomination. He got 510 votes or something of the sort, but he didn\'t quite make it. I liked Wallace. I thought at that time that Henry Wallace was a fine kind of American and my kind of American. He didn\'t get the nomination. I lost $50 in a bet with another writer. I recall it very well. He didn\'t get the nomination, and this additionally bothered me. I said, "Well, look, I think the people wanted Wallace. That is the way I read it. The people wanted Wallace and they didn\'t get Wallace." At that time I was approached-wasn\'t approached-to tell it more correctly, I was seated in another writer\'s office. I was in the directors\' building at RKO. I went in for a chat, as people do on the lot, into another writer\'s office, and we were talking about his script. It was a comedy. It had to do with women. By that I mean, more specifically, it had to do with the role of women in society, so to speak: should they or shouldn\'t they have careers, and so forth. He started, entered discussions about the meaning of this script. We had a long and interesting discussion about what it meant. He suddenly looked at me and he said, "Why aren\'t you one of us?" At the first moment I thought he meant the guild; for just about one moment. I said "I am." He said "No; you are not." I said "Oh," like Don. I said "I didn\'t have too happy an experience. I just don\'t see it is for me. I don\'t like it, really." \x0cCOMMUTNBTACTIVITIt S IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 395 He asked me why, and I gave my reasons. He said, "Well now, look, Bart, times have changed. The party has changed. It isn\'t sectarian now. It has a big, broad base and you have these objections to it. Now, you are a reasonable man. Why don\'t you come and take a look and see if it is what you think it is." We argued that out for a while. He knew of my disturbances that I just mentioned, how I felt about them. He used them. And I said, "Well, I don\'t know. Maybe I will give it a try. I don\'t know." I didn\'t commit myself. About a week passed and he came back to me and he said, "Say, what is this about you?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Well, I understand you were expelled." I said, "Expelled from what?" He said, "From the Communist Party." I said, "Not to my knowledge; no, of course, I wasn\'t." He said, "I understand there were a lot of charges against you and you were expelled back in New York in 1936." I said, "Why, that is a lot of poppycock. I walked away." He said, "Well, that is the story."

In any event, Mr. Hathaway-he was then to me just Mr. Hathaway. I didn't know him. I didn't attend this particular forum, because I think I was possibly 19 or 20, and I was interested in football and boxing, occasionally in studies, and always in girls, and I had no political interests at the time. Hathaway came down and spoke, in any event, and a group of athletes-I was not among the group-a group of athletes went in to break up that meeting. They were pretty rugged boys, and I know it. I fought with them on the team and played around with them and so forth, and they were pretty rugged boys, and they went in and they broke up the Hathaway meeting, and they threw out Hathaway, and managed to get into fights with those that were in attendance. I heard about the incident. I wasn't anywhere around it, but I heard about it, and I was worried about it; I didn't like mob action, and I felt that this was an injustice. I felt that the boys had acted incorrectly, that they had discredited the university, and I spoke about that to many people. Let's put it this way: I have always been articulate to some extent, and I spoke about it to many people. I thought at the time and still think that you have got to do some thinking about the world you live in. I didn't even know there was such a thing at that time. I don't believe that I was aware of the existence of the Communist Party, as such, and I am not even sure that the persons who talked to me were Communists, but we talked about Marxism. \x0c384 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA And they talked about socialism, and so forth. They handed me pamphlets and they talked and they talked and they talked. It began to condition me-let me place the year. The year was, I believe, 1933. It was very easy in 1933 to be conditioned in the direction of socialism. As a matter of fact, I might say the people I talked to in regard to my appearance here today, if as many people voted for Norman Thomas in 1932 as they assured me they did, I think he won, and the votes were stalled. In any event, this was 1933 or 1934. I don't recall the exact year. My feelings began then in the direction of the various pamphlets, books, and so forth that I was handed, and I thumbed through.", ' I see. I don\'t recall. I know I have heard both references, and I don\'t know her. I was put in contact with her by Beck, and she reviewed the story with me. She told me that there were a number of charges leveled against me in New York. I had done everything, apparently, but set fire to my mother. She stated that I had been expelled from the party, according to the best of their knowledge, and that I had been considered as unreliable, a provocateur-a term frequently bandied about-and that I had stolen a typewriter from the Communist Party headquarters and had pawned same, and that I had deserted the party. The party likes faithful lovers and many other things. I don\'t even recall them all: Now, if she said that I deserted the party, I said, "Well, this is true." But as to the typewriter incident, there was no truth in it whatsoever. As to having been expelled, as far as I knew there was no truth in it whatsoever, and presented the charges. I asked her what I could do about it. Well, it didn\'t seem that I could do very much about it. I asked her if there was such a thing as a hearing. She said, well they take care of it in their own way. She said she would correspond with New York. \x0cCOMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANORLEB AREA 448 I said, "Well, you ought to know something next week." She said, "No, it will be longer than that." Many months went by and- I became more and more agitated, because now a process began. People previously friendly to me were no longer friendly. I would arrange to have dinner with friends, my wife and I, and at the lost minute the dinner date would be canc4ed. I would walk into gild meethgM and backs would be turned if I went to enter the conversations avid I became very agitated at this. It is not pleasant, and I still didn\'t fully understand it. I understood the emanation of it. I meant to say that I wits not equipped to handle it at this time. It therefore became a struggle on my part, I should say, and a very important one, to clear these particular charges. I wasn\'t concerned at that time with the issue of the Communist Party. I was concerned with the fact that apparently a rumor factory and a very competent rumor factory wts at work. Ohe incident brought it into its sharpest focus. I had been a proliflic provider of material for USO camp shows. As a matter of fact, I believe, I was told by the USO that I wrote more camp show material than auy other writer in the United States, and was commended by them for that. Some of my sketches had played to as many, I wits told, as 6 million meni. It seemed like an awful lot to me. And I doubted it, but nevertheless I knew they were played to many, many Army camps and installations throughout-where tightinF forces were stationed. rilhe USO w~as trying to .get comedy material unslanted, and they arranlgedl at the Screen Writers\' Guild-not the Screen Writers\' Guild, the 11ollywood Writers\' 11obilization-to have an evening in which theT would showv the kind of material that they wanted. \'I hey gave me what was to the Communist the kiss of death. It shows my material as unslanted material. That evening Carole Landis and Fay McKenzie and Ed Lorre who ran USO camp shows, entertainment division came down together with others--I don\'t recall whom-to the ollywood-Roosevelt Hotel, and they played these sketches. Now, this one sketch was the forerunner of a type of sketch that has become tiresome enough since. It was a psychiatric sketch. At the time there hadn\'t been psychiatrist sketches of this character. It was a very funny sketch, and it had played already with teams taking it out and stars requesting to take it out, even though it had ben old material by this time, they still wanted to take it out to military installations. The sketch was played, and most of the writers present sat on their hands. They didn\'t laugh, they didn\'t applaud, they didn\'t like it. This was rather unusual, in view of the fact that by that time several hundred thousand American 01\'s had laughed their heads off at the sketch. And these were supposed to be judges of material. It was brought in because it was to be the top laugh producer that the USO had in its repertoire. They sat on their hanas, and I was deeply agitated by this. I began to feel by this time that I was involved in a crusade. I hadn\'t done what was charged. The feelings at that time were not political; they were personal. I wanted to clear a name and be able to work again and work in peace. \x0c444 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TILE LOS ANGELES AREA I don\'t know how many months ensued. It dissolves, as you sy in motion-picture terminology. But lots of time elapsed. In the course of this time I did everything that I know to do to clear the so-called charges. Subsequently I was engad to do a documentary fl m by Prince. ton Film Center, the Rockefeller Foundation subsidizing it, in Gloucester, Mass., on war shipbuilding. I wont up there and did the film and came back through Now York. In New York I went to Communist Party headquarters on 13th Street, and I told them my story. I told them that there was this story extant on the west coast, that it wasn\'t true, and I wanted them to produce for me any records which indicated any truth in these particular charges. q I also said to them, "If these charges are true, would you have a record I" They said, "Oh, certainly, we would. If the charges are true, believe me, we will have them.I About a half hour passed and a girl came to me who introduced herself as an organization secretary, I believe, I don\'t recall. In sviy event, I was taken to another floor. I waited some more. 8he came back down and told me, "Not only are there no charges against you, but somebody up stairs knew you who says you are a md hty fine fellow." She said, "No; we have no record whatsoevere and, therefore there wouldn\'t be any truth in these charges." I said, "Well, they seem to believe it in the West." She said, "Well, that is pretty far away. What do you want us to do about it I" I said, "For heaven\'s sake, lot them know that these charges are untrue and tell them to stop their rumor factory." She said, "We will be very glad to." I appreciated that. I came back to the coast. I got in touch with the same people. No word from New York. More time went on months. Finally, apparently there was word from New York. I aon\'t know what oiircuitous routes it took, whether it came out by carrier pigeons or how, but, in any event, apparently the word came out at that time that I was cleared in New York and that the charges were groundless. This Elizabeth Leech Glenn again contacted me and told me that I was cleared and they regretted very much the fact that I had been so badly treated as a result of It, she was sorry, and she sent a rather inept public-relations officer, I might say, to see me at my home, who explained that in revolutionary situations the innocent must die with the guilty, it is just too bad. "We are sorry, fellow, that this hap. pened to you. We are sorry that for a year and a half now," or a year, whatever the time was, "we understand, it is awful," she said. "Once up in Michigan the same thing happened to me, I was called a renegade," she said, "a Trotskyite, and some kind of deviationist." She said, "I lived through that, and I know what it is and I understand," and so forth. "And it is too bad, but you mustn\'t have any ill feeling toward the party. You must understand it. You must be a Bolshevik."', ' Though he was well known, he had been a very prominent writer during the 1920\'s. He had been considered a very promising, rather than prominent, novelist, and I told him about my play. He became quite excited about it and be said, "I think that I can get this thing on the boards of New York in 6 months." He then suggested a collaboration. I learned later that this, of course, was a common suggestion. At the time, I was a little taken back. It seems that he was an experienced writer. He had written many shows for pictures. He told me his many virtues, and he had them, incidentally, as a writer. At the particular period of his life he had everything but the willingness to work. He suggested we collaborate. He said he had a producer ready, and he said that the producer ready was a man who had subsidized at one particular time Jet Harris in New York and that Jet Harris would probably direct the play. After considerable time considering the matter, I think probably 24 hours, I decided that it might be a good thing and that he could teach me a great deal about the craft of playwriting, and that I would work with him. He invited me to move to his residence. (Representative Harold H. Velde reentered the hearing room at this point, 11: 40 a. m.) He invited me to move to his residence in Hollywood and to. work under very nice material circumstances. He produced the money necessary for the writing of the play and I was put on a deal where I was to receive $50 a week during the course of the writing for a specified period of time, a contract that was never completely lived up to, but that is neither here nor there at this moment. We worked on the play and we engaged in many arguments about its meaning, about its ideology. The play was simple and it was about people. He would argue with me that it just didn\'t have the political sharpness in it that it should have. I would argue in return that I considered myself a writer and I certainly wanted to continue to be a writer and I thought that that was an inhibitory process, "Let me write the play" being my argument, and "What must come out, let it come out." He would inhibit me and he would desire to see page after page, and then there would be these frantic arguments about the meaning of lines ahd the meaning of scenes and so forth, and webecame quite unhappy in the course of it. \x0c392 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA ', ' In 1944, during the summer of 1944, just before that, at the end of 1943 my family had learned officially of the death of my brother in action. He was a B-17 chauffeur in the Mediterranean, action over the Mediterranean. I was quite disturbed by this time. All my brothers were in action, and I wanted to be. I was quite disturbed at the time, I think, over the going of the war; and, like countless millions of Americans, I was praying for every possible victory that the Russians could have. They put up a fine defense at Stalingrad and had impressed the world. In 1944 I was working at RKO Studios, at the time that Henry Wallace was still Vice President of the United States and was up for renomination. He got 510 votes or something of the sort, but he didn\'t quite make it. I liked Wallace. I thought at that time that Henry Wallace was a fine kind of American and my kind of American. He didn\'t get the nomination. I lost $50 in a bet with another writer. I recall it very well. He didn\'t get the nomination, and this additionally bothered me. I said, "Well, look, I think the people wanted Wallace. That is the way I read it. The people wanted Wallace and they didn\'t get Wallace." At that time I was approached-wasn\'t approached-to tell it more correctly, I was seated in another writer\'s office. I was in the directors\' building at RKO. I went in for a chat, as people do on the lot, into another writer\'s office, and we were talking about his script. It was a comedy. It had to do with women. By that I mean, more specifically, it had to do with the role of women in society, so to speak: should they or shouldn\'t they have careers, and so forth. He started, entered discussions about the meaning of this script. We had a long and interesting discussion about what it meant. He suddenly looked at me and he said, "Why aren\'t you one of us?" At the first moment I thought he meant the guild; for just about one moment. I said "I am." He said "No; you are not." I said "Oh," like Don. I said "I didn\'t have too happy an experience. I just don\'t see it is for me. I don\'t like it, really." \x0cCOMMUTNBTACTIVITIt S IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 395 He asked me why, and I gave my reasons. He said, "Well now, look, Bart, times have changed. The party has changed. It isn\'t sectarian now. It has a big, broad base and you have these objections to it. Now, you are a reasonable man. Why don\'t you come and take a look and see if it is what you think it is." We argued that out for a while. He knew of my disturbances that I just mentioned, how I felt about them. He used them. And I said, "Well, I don\'t know. Maybe I will give it a try. I don\'t know." I didn\'t commit myself. About a week passed and he came back to me and he said, "Say, what is this about you?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Well, I understand you were expelled." I said, "Expelled from what?" He said, "From the Communist Party." I said, "Not to my knowledge; no, of course, I wasn\'t." He said, "I understand there were a lot of charges against you and you were expelled back in New York in 1936." I said, "Why, that is a lot of poppycock. I walked away." He said, "Well, that is the story." And he said, "Brother, if I were you I would get that cleared up, because if you don\'t get that cleared up your name is mud in this town."'])

I was put in contact with her by Beck, and she reviewed the story with me. She told me that there were a number of charges leveled against me in New York. I had done everything, apparently, but set fire to my mother. She stated that I had been expelled from the party, according to the best of their knowledge, and that I had been considered as unreliable, a provocateur-a term frequently bandied about-and that I had stolen a typewriter from the Communist Party headquarters and had pawned same, and that I had deserted the party. The party likes faithful lovers and many other things. I don\'t even recall them all: Now, if she said that I deserted the party, I said, "Well, this is true." But as to the typewriter incident, there was no truth in it whatsoever. As to having been expelled, as far as I knew there was no truth in it whatsoever, and presented the charges. I asked her what I could do about it. Well, it didn\'t seem that I could do very much about it. I asked her if there was such a thing as a hearing. She said, well they take care of it in their own way. She said she would correspond with New York. \x0cCOMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANORLEB AREA 448 I said, "Well, you ought to know something next week." She said, "No, it will be longer than that." Many months went by and- I became more and more agitated, because now a process began. People previously friendly to me were no longer friendly. I would arrange to have dinner with friends, my wife and I, and at the lost minute the dinner date would be canc4ed. I would walk into gild meethgM and backs would be turned if I went to enter the conversations avid I became very agitated at this. It is not pleasant, and I still didn\'t fully understand it. I understood the emanation of it. I meant to say that I wits not equipped to handle it at this time. It therefore became a struggle on my part, I should say, and a very important one, to clear these particular charges. I wasn\'t concerned at that time with the issue of the Communist Party. I was concerned with the fact that apparently a rumor factory and a very competent rumor factory wts at work. Ohe incident brought it into its sharpest focus. I had been a proliflic provider of material for USO camp shows. As a matter of fact, I believe, I was told by the USO that I wrote more camp show material than auy other writer in the United States, and was commended by them for that. Some of my sketches had played to as many, I wits told, as 6 million meni. It seemed like an awful lot to me. And I doubted it, but nevertheless I knew they were played to many, many Army camps and installations throughout-where tightinF forces were stationed. rilhe USO w~as trying to .get comedy material unslanted, and they arranlgedl at the Screen Writers\' Guild-not the Screen Writers\' Guild, the 11ollywood Writers\' 11obilization-to have an evening in which theT would showv the kind of material that they wanted. \'I hey gave me what was to the Communist the kiss of death. It shows my material as unslanted material. That evening Carole Landis and Fay McKenzie and Ed Lorre who ran USO camp shows, entertainment division came down together with others--I don\'t recall whom-to the ollywood-Roosevelt Hotel, and they played these sketches. Now, this one sketch was the forerunner of a type of sketch that has become tiresome enough since. It was a psychiatric sketch. At the time there hadn\'t been psychiatrist sketches of this character. It was a very funny sketch, and it had played already with teams taking it out and stars requesting to take it out, even though it had ben old material by this time, they still wanted to take it out to military installations. The sketch was played, and most of the writers present sat on their hands. They didn\'t laugh, they didn\'t applaud, they didn\'t like it. This was rather unusual, in view of the fact that by that time several hundred thousand American 01\'s had laughed their heads off at the sketch. And these were supposed to be judges of material. It was brought in because it was to be the top laugh producer that the USO had in its repertoire. They sat on their hanas, and I was deeply agitated by this. I began to feel by this time that I was involved in a crusade. I hadn\'t done what was charged. The feelings at that time were not political; they were personal. I wanted to clear a name and be able to work again and work in peace. \x0c444 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TILE LOS ANGELES AREA I don\'t know how many months ensued. It dissolves, as you sy in motion-picture terminology. But lots of time elapsed. In the course of this time I did everything that I know to do to clear the so-called charges. Subsequently I was engad to do a documentary fl m by Prince. ton Film Center, the Rockefeller Foundation subsidizing it, in Gloucester, Mass., on war shipbuilding. I wont up there and did the film and came back through Now York. In New York I went to Communist Party headquarters on 13th Street, and I told them my story. I told them that there was this story extant on the west coast, that it wasn\'t true, and I wanted them to produce for me any records which indicated any truth in these particular charges. q I also said to them, "If these charges are true, would you have a record I" They said, "Oh, certainly, we would. If the charges are true, believe me, we will have them.I About a half hour passed and a girl came to me who introduced herself as an organization secretary, I believe, I don\'t recall. In sviy event, I was taken to another floor. I waited some more. 8he came back down and told me, "Not only are there no charges against you, but somebody up stairs knew you who says you are a md hty fine fellow." She said, "No; we have no record whatsoevere and, therefore there wouldn\'t be any truth in these charges." I said, "Well, they seem to believe it in the West." She said, "Well, that is pretty far away. What do you want us to do about it I" I said, "For heaven\'s sake, lot them know that these charges are untrue and tell them to stop their rumor factory." She said, "We will be very glad to." I appreciated that. I came back to the coast. I got in touch with the same people. No word from New York. More time went on months. Finally, apparently there was word from New York. I aon\'t know what oiircuitous routes it took, whether it came out by carrier pigeons or how, but, in any event, apparently the word came out at that time that I was cleared in New York and that the charges were groundless. This Elizabeth Leech Glenn again contacted me and told me that I was cleared and they regretted very much the fact that I had been so badly treated as a result of It, she was sorry, and she sent a rather inept public-relations officer, I might say, to see me at my home, who explained that in revolutionary situations the innocent must die with the guilty, it is just too bad. "We are sorry, fellow, that this hap. pened to you. We are sorry that for a year and a half now," or a year, whatever the time was, "we understand, it is awful," she said. "Once up in Michigan the same thing happened to me, I was called a renegade," she said, "a Trotskyite, and some kind of deviationist." She said, "I lived through that, and I know what it is and I understand," and so forth. "And it is too bad, but you mustn\'t have any ill feeling toward the party. You must understand it. You must be a Bolshevik."', ' In 1944, during the summer of 1944, just before that, at the end of 1943 my family had learned officially of the death of my brother in action. He was a B-17 chauffeur in the Mediterranean, action over the Mediterranean. I was quite disturbed by this time. All my brothers were in action, and I wanted to be. I was quite disturbed at the time, I think, over the going of the war; and, like countless millions of Americans, I was praying for every possible victory that the Russians could have. They put up a fine defense at Stalingrad and had impressed the world. In 1944 I was working at RKO Studios, at the time that Henry Wallace was still Vice President of the United States and was up for renomination. He got 510 votes or something of the sort, but he didn\'t quite make it. I liked Wallace. I thought at that time that Henry Wallace was a fine kind of American and my kind of American. He didn\'t get the nomination. I lost $50 in a bet with another writer. I recall it very well. He didn\'t get the nomination, and this additionally bothered me. I said, "Well, look, I think the people wanted Wallace. That is the way I read it. The people wanted Wallace and they didn\'t get Wallace." At that time I was approached-wasn\'t approached-to tell it more correctly, I was seated in another writer\'s office. I was in the directors\' building at RKO. I went in for a chat, as people do on the lot, into another writer\'s office, and we were talking about his script. It was a comedy. It had to do with women. By that I mean, more specifically, it had to do with the role of women in society, so to speak: should they or shouldn\'t they have careers, and so forth. He started, entered discussions about the meaning of this script. We had a long and interesting discussion about what it meant. He suddenly looked at me and he said, "Why aren\'t you one of us?" At the first moment I thought he meant the guild; for just about one moment. I said "I am." He said "No; you are not." I said "Oh," like Don. I said "I didn\'t have too happy an experience. I just don\'t see it is for me. I don\'t like it, really." \x0cCOMMUTNBTACTIVITIt S IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 395 He asked me why, and I gave my reasons. He said, "Well now, look, Bart, times have changed. The party has changed. It isn\'t sectarian now. It has a big, broad base and you have these objections to it. Now, you are a reasonable man. Why don\'t you come and take a look and see if it is what you think it is." We argued that out for a while. He knew of my disturbances that I just mentioned, how I felt about them. He used them. And I said, "Well, I don\'t know. Maybe I will give it a try. I don\'t know." I didn\'t commit myself. About a week passed and he came back to me and he said, "Say, what is this about you?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Well, I understand you were expelled." I said, "Expelled from what?" He said, "From the Communist Party." I said, "Not to my knowledge; no, of course, I wasn\'t." He said, "I understand there were a lot of charges against you and you were expelled back in New York in 1936." I said, "Why, that is a lot of poppycock. I walked away." He said, "Well, that is the story." And he said, "Brother, if I were you I would get that cleared up, because if you don\'t get that cleared up your name is mud in this town."'])

I asked her what I could do about it. Well, it didn\'t seem that I could do very much about it. I asked her if there was such a thing as a hearing. She said, well they take care of it in their own way. She said she would correspond with New York. \x0cCOMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANORLEB AREA 448 I said, "Well, you ought to know something next week." She said, "No, it will be longer than that." Many months went by and- I became more and more agitated, because now a process began. People previously friendly to me were no longer friendly. I would arrange to have dinner with friends, my wife and I, and at the lost minute the dinner date would be canc4ed. I would walk into gild meethgM and backs would be turned if I went to enter the conversations avid I became very agitated at this. It is not pleasant, and I still didn\'t fully understand it. I understood the emanation of it. I meant to say that I wits not equipped to handle it at this time. It therefore became a struggle on my part, I should say, and a very important one, to clear these particular charges. I wasn\'t concerned at that time with the issue of the Communist Party. I was concerned with the fact that apparently a rumor factory and a very competent rumor factory wts at work. Ohe incident brought it into its sharpest focus. I had been a proliflic provider of material for USO camp shows. As a matter of fact, I believe, I was told by the USO that I wrote more camp show material than auy other writer in the United States, and was commended by them for that. Some of my sketches had played to as many, I wits told, as 6 million meni. It seemed like an awful lot to me. And I doubted it, but nevertheless I knew they were played to many, many Army camps and installations throughout-where tightinF forces were stationed. rilhe USO w~as trying to .get comedy material unslanted, and they arranlgedl at the Screen Writers\' Guild-not the Screen Writers\' Guild, the 11ollywood Writers\' 11obilization-to have an evening in which theT would showv the kind of material that they wanted. \'I hey gave me what was to the Communist the kiss of death. It shows my material as unslanted material. That evening Carole Landis and Fay McKenzie and Ed Lorre who ran USO camp shows, entertainment division came down together with others--I don\'t recall whom-to the ollywood-Roosevelt Hotel, and they played these sketches. Now, this one sketch was the forerunner of a type of sketch that has become tiresome enough since. It was a psychiatric sketch. At the time there hadn\'t been psychiatrist sketches of this character. It was a very funny sketch, and it had played already with teams taking it out and stars requesting to take it out, even though it had ben old material by this time, they still wanted to take it out to military installations. The sketch was played, and most of the writers present sat on their hands. They didn\'t laugh, they didn\'t applaud, they didn\'t like it. This was rather unusual, in view of the fact that by that time several hundred thousand American 01\'s had laughed their heads off at the sketch. And these were supposed to be judges of material. It was brought in because it was to be the top laugh producer that the USO had in its repertoire. They sat on their hanas, and I was deeply agitated by this. I began to feel by this time that I was involved in a crusade. I hadn\'t done what was charged. The feelings at that time were not political; they were personal. I wanted to clear a name and be able to work again and work in peace. \x0c444 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TILE LOS ANGELES AREA I don\'t know how many months ensued. It dissolves, as you sy in motion-picture terminology. But lots of time elapsed. In the course of this time I did everything that I know to do to clear the so-called charges. Subsequently I was engad to do a documentary fl m by Prince. ton Film Center, the Rockefeller Foundation subsidizing it, in Gloucester, Mass., on war shipbuilding. I wont up there and did the film and came back through Now York. In New York I went to Communist Party headquarters on 13th Street, and I told them my story. I told them that there was this story extant on the west coast, that it wasn\'t true, and I wanted them to produce for me any records which indicated any truth in these particular charges. q I also said to them, "If these charges are true, would you have a record I" They said, "Oh, certainly, we would. If the charges are true, believe me, we will have them.I About a half hour passed and a girl came to me who introduced herself as an organization secretary, I believe, I don\'t recall. In sviy event, I was taken to another floor. I waited some more. 8he came back down and told me, "Not only are there no charges against you, but somebody up stairs knew you who says you are a md hty fine fellow." She said, "No; we have no record whatsoevere and, therefore there wouldn\'t be any truth in these charges." I said, "Well, they seem to believe it in the West." She said, "Well, that is pretty far away. What do you want us to do about it I" I said, "For heaven\'s sake, lot them know that these charges are untrue and tell them to stop their rumor factory." She said, "We will be very glad to." I appreciated that. I came back to the coast. I got in touch with the same people. No word from New York. More time went on months. Finally, apparently there was word from New York. I aon\'t know what oiircuitous routes it took, whether it came out by carrier pigeons or how, but, in any event, apparently the word came out at that time that I was cleared in New York and that the charges were groundless. This Elizabeth Leech Glenn again contacted me and told me that I was cleared and they regretted very much the fact that I had been so badly treated as a result of It, she was sorry, and she sent a rather inept public-relations officer, I might say, to see me at my home, who explained that in revolutionary situations the innocent must die with the guilty, it is just too bad. "We are sorry, fellow, that this hap. pened to you. We are sorry that for a year and a half now," or a year, whatever the time was, "we understand, it is awful," she said. "Once up in Michigan the same thing happened to me, I was called a renegade," she said, "a Trotskyite, and some kind of deviationist." She said, "I lived through that, and I know what it is and I understand," and so forth. "And it is too bad, but you mustn\'t have any ill feeling toward the party. You must understand it. You must be a Bolshevik."', ' In 1944, during the summer of 1944, just before that, at the end of 1943 my family had learned officially of the death of my brother in action. He was a B-17 chauffeur in the Mediterranean, action over the Mediterranean. I was quite disturbed by this time. All my brothers were in action, and I wanted to be. I was quite disturbed at the time, I think, over the going of the war; and, like countless millions of Americans, I was praying for every possible victory that the Russians could have. They put up a fine defense at Stalingrad and had impressed the world. In 1944 I was working at RKO Studios, at the time that Henry Wallace was still Vice President of the United States and was up for renomination. He got 510 votes or something of the sort, but he didn\'t quite make it. I liked Wallace. I thought at that time that Henry Wallace was a fine kind of American and my kind of American. He didn\'t get the nomination. I lost $50 in a bet with another writer. I recall it very well. He didn\'t get the nomination, and this additionally bothered me. I said, "Well, look, I think the people wanted Wallace. That is the way I read it. The people wanted Wallace and they didn\'t get Wallace." At that time I was approached-wasn\'t approached-to tell it more correctly, I was seated in another writer\'s office. I was in the directors\' building at RKO. I went in for a chat, as people do on the lot, into another writer\'s office, and we were talking about his script. It was a comedy. It had to do with women. By that I mean, more specifically, it had to do with the role of women in society, so to speak: should they or shouldn\'t they have careers, and so forth. He started, entered discussions about the meaning of this script. We had a long and interesting discussion about what it meant. He suddenly looked at me and he said, "Why aren\'t you one of us?" At the first moment I thought he meant the guild; for just about one moment. I said "I am." He said "No; you are not." I said "Oh," like Don. I said "I didn\'t have too happy an experience. I just don\'t see it is for me. I don\'t like it, really." \x0cCOMMUTNBTACTIVITIt S IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 395 He asked me why, and I gave my reasons. He said, "Well now, look, Bart, times have changed. The party has changed. It isn\'t sectarian now. It has a big, broad base and you have these objections to it. Now, you are a reasonable man. Why don\'t you come and take a look and see if it is what you think it is." We argued that out for a while. He knew of my disturbances that I just mentioned, how I felt about them. He used them. And I said, "Well, I don\'t know. Maybe I will give it a try. I don\'t know." I didn\'t commit myself. About a week passed and he came back to me and he said, "Say, what is this about you?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Well, I understand you were expelled." I said, "Expelled from what?" He said, "From the Communist Party." I said, "Not to my knowledge; no, of course, I wasn\'t." He said, "I understand there were a lot of charges against you and you were expelled back in New York in 1936." I said, "Why, that is a lot of poppycock. I walked away." He said, "Well, that is the story." And he said, "Brother, if I were you I would get that cleared up, because if you don\'t get that cleared up your name is mud in this town."'])

The statement reads: I doubt the efficiency of the two bills which were sent, largely because of the fact that Communist Party is such a nebulous thing. In part it is a clearly subversive thing, subject to what Stalin calls the iron discipline of the party, with respect to policies which are largely formulated by the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. On the other hand, the Communist Party in some countries, notably France, Italy, and to a lesser extent the United States, draws into its ranks many who in no sense seek the revolutionary overthrow of our institutions as does the hard core of the Communist Party, but who look to the Communist Party as a method of reform which will ,cure evils. Those who accept the iron discipline of the party are in a very real sense the agents of foreign principals and hold doctrines which partake of treason. On the other hand, many others are finding in the Communist Party an outlet for a sense of grievance. But they are not in reality either agents of the foreign principal, nor do they entertain treasonable plans. The difficulty is how to distinguish one from the other. That is the difficulty which I do not see clearly how to solve. ', ' As far as I know, they were Bob Roberts and John Garfield. That is the best of my knowledge.

He was not a writer, but through many of the contacts I became part of, I met Mr. Morgan and he was very influential in setting up many of the kinds of things for me to read. He was exciting to listen to. He was very much of a student and I became so imbued with many of the things he talked about, and gradually we moved in toward tue philosophies of Marx and Engels, along with Schopenhauer and Hegel, and even so my interest was so great that he and his wife were instrumental in presenting to me the opportunity of becoming a member of the Communist Party.'])

I became very interested in philosophies, history, psychology, and naturally I became acquainted with many men in the profession I was then part of, and in particular with a man who is now deceased, a man by the name of Stephen Morgan. He was not a writer, but through many of the contacts I became part of, I met Mr. Morgan and he was very influential in setting up many of the kinds of things for me to read. He was exciting to listen to. He was very much of a student and I became so imbued with many of the things he talked about, and gradually we moved in toward tue philosophies of Marx and Engels, along with Schopenhauer and Hegel, and even so my interest was so great that he and his wife were instrumental in presenting to me the opportunity of becoming a member of the Communist Party.'])

I became very interested in philosophies, history, psychology, and naturally I became acquainted with many men in the profession I was then part of, and in particular with a man who is now deceased, a man by the name of Stephen Morgan. He was not a writer, but through many of the contacts I became part of, I met Mr. Morgan and he was very influential in setting up many of the kinds of things for me to read. He was exciting to listen to. He was very much of a student and I became so imbued with many of the things he talked about, and gradually we moved in toward tue philosophies of Marx and Engels, along with Schopenhauer and Hegel, and even so my interest was so great that he and his wife were instrumental in presenting to me the opportunity of becoming a member of the Communist Party.', ' Men such as Dalton Trumbo, John Howard Lawson, Lester Cole, Paul .Jarrico, Dick Collins, Paul Trabusis.'])

He then said he would contact the proper authorities within the party and have me cleared. Now, this was a very strange first induction; I had to be cleared. But I agreed to this. He said also that he would contact me or have someone contact me as to the next move. Three or four days later he did call me and said that I had been cleared and would I contact a woman by the name of Madelaine Ruthven.', " He gave me her address, somewhere on Canon Drive, and I was to meet her sometime in the late afternoon the following day, and I did. Madelaine Ruthven greeted me and accepted me as a cleared person to be a member of the party. At that time she told me that I would be expected to pay a percentage of my income, a very small percentage. I think it was somewhere between 2 and 5-no; it wasn't 5-- or 3 percent, something of that order. Strangely, too, at this point she made it clear that the party was not necessarily a revolutionary party. This is an interesting point I wish to take up a little later. But she made it quite clear that the Communist Party was not a revolutionary party, and that anything I would hear to that effect was strictly an attempt upon the party by the Trotskyites, reactionaries, because the party was not interested in the overthrow of the Government."])

    speechacts set([" There is a great deal of difference between 1947 and 1951 as far as the Communist Party is concerned, or at least as far as my awareness of what is going on is concerned. In 1947 the cold war had not yet gone beyond the freezing point. I wanted to believe that Russia was very sincere in wanting peace, and I didn't feel the Communist Party in this country was any particular menace as far as I knew, and I felt the committee befone which I appeared was invading a field they could not properly invade, that is, freedom of speech and freedom of thought'; and I also sincerely believed the procedures used by the committee were not completely in keeping with an honest investigation. On those grounds I refused to testify at the time. Since that time a number of very important developments have taken place. In the first place, I had never heard before 1947 anybody say they would refuse to fight for this country in a war against Soviet Russia. I think I was in England when I first saw an article about an Australian party member who said he would not fight against Soviet Russia. Then I saw articles about American party members taking the same position; I believe Paul Robeson was one. Since then other party members in this country have stated they would not fight for their country. I think in a democracy each person takes upon himself the duty to defend his country in time of war. Along with other people, I signed the Stockholm Peace Petition. I believe in peace, as everybody does. I hoped they were sincere. However, the Korean War made me realize that they were not. I think any intelligent person must realize that the North Koreans would not have attacked the South Koreans unless they had the backing of very strong forces. I can't prove it, but I believe those forces \x0c INDUSTRY 411 are Communist China and Communist Russia. This, too, disturbed me tremendously, and made me realize there is a Communist menace and that the Communist Party in this country is a part of that menace. The third thing was the spy trials, the development of the Hiss, Coplon, and Gneenglass cases, and the Fuchs case in England. To me there is a significant thing about the spy trials. The thing that impressed me was that these people did not get any money, or not much. There are spies who work for their country, and we have respect for them. There are other spies who receive money for their work, and there may be a certain admiration for them, because they risk their necks. These people are doing it for love of the party. This is treason. I think the party that has used them is treasonable also. I don't say all members of the Communist Party are guilty of treason, but I think a party that encourages them to act in this capacity is treasonable. For this reason I am willing to talk today."])

I told Gielgud this morning and he was overjoyed. He will call you to get together with himself and Frank Nugent between now and next Monday so we can get the rest of the committee organized for the board's approval. I have some ideas of a newsletter monthly to the membership that Irwin will tell you about. Nugent will tell you what ideas we have on the awards affair for the last of January. Those are our two immediate projects-plus picking a hot special programs subcommittee with a vice chairman on it that has some ideas. Again, my appreciation for your offering to come in and help.
