# sentiment

To use this utility with lexicons, make subdirectories for each
lexicon as specified in config.py. 

```
 - liwc: "liwc/features.txt"
 - mpqa: "pitt/data.txt"
 - bing liu: "liu/positive-words.txt"
             "liu/negative-words.txt"
```

Once you have the data there, the sentiment module should work properly.
