Committee members present: Representatives John S. Wood (chairman), Francis E. Walter, Clyde Doyle, James B. Frazier, Jr., Harold H. Velde, Bernard W. Kearney, Donald J. Jackson, and Charles E.

Poore, editor. TESTIMONY OF LARRY PARKS, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, LOUIS MANDEL
Mr. WooD. Mr. Parks, at the conclusion of the morning session, the committee had a meeting, and it was the unanimous expression of the members of the committee that we were going to seek your further cooperation in an executive session, for further testimony that will not be publicized until such time, if at all, as the committee itself may deem expedient. It may never happen, but it is only fair to say to you that it is in the discretion of the committee at any time to make public any information that you may see fit to give in this executive session. Until such time, if it does happen, it will be kept in the confidential files of the committee. With that statement, counsel will now propound additional questions.
Mr. MANDEL. So that Mr. Parks will be fully aware of where he is going, is it the intention of the committee that unless he answers these questions in private, that is, in executive session, they intend to cite him for contempt of this committee ?
Mr. WooD. Thle committee makes no threats.
Mr. MANDEL. We haven't approached it as a matter of threat, just to clear his thinking so that he is fully informed in his own mind of the consequences of following that path. SThis testimony, taken in executive session during the 82d Congress, has been examined and released by the full committee. 2299 2300 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WooD. Counselor, you have asked a question, and I will answer it as frankly as I can. The committee did not discuss that phase of it and hasn't discussed it. It is entirely possible, if Mr. Parks placed himself in the position here of being in contempt of Congress, that the committee may request a citation for that purpose. On the other hand, it may not. I cannot speak for the committee. Does that answer your question ?
Mr. MANDEL. No, not quite. I would like to spend another minute on it. I realize that, and I also realize the position of the committee not to commit themselves to Mr. Parks, but im view of Mr. Parks' general attitude of being cooperative, and everyone easily understands here what is motivating him-he feels so bad about what he has to do, and if he thought in his own judgment there was any chance at all that you would elicit from him information that was important to you, that he would very gladly give it to you voluntarily. It is only saving that little bit of something that you live with. You have to see and walk in Hollywood with that. You have to meet your children and your wife with it and your friends. It is that little bit that you want to save. Although I don't want to ask the committee to commit itself, in fairness to Mr. Parks, he may have to sacrifice the arm with gangrene in order to save the body. Even though he doesn't like it, he will walk around the rest of his life without an arm. I realize the purposes of this committee, and our attitude has been one of cooperation. We want to go right through with that. Now, if that is going to be the penalty that he eventually will have to pay, then I have to help him think a different way. I have to urge him a different way. His honest and sincere opinion is that what he is going to give you will only eat up his insides and you will get nothing, no more than you have today. This is a conviction of this man.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Attorney, the committee has to be the judge of what information has pertinency and relevancy. It can't take the opinions of other people. I have tried to be frank about it, and the committee is very anxious-I think you will agree-to be considerate of this man. The committee is in no sense responsible for the position he finds himself in, but we are responsible for the position we find ourselves in. We have a responsibility and duty that is on us as public officials.
Mr. MANDEL. I realize that. 
Mr. WooD. I will be glad to answer any further inquiries.
Mr. MANDEL. I realize that. I was wondering if I could get the opinion of the committee before, because the direction will have to come to him "If youl don't answer, then we will cite you for tempt." I think that is part of the law, for the man to know conthe price. So it would have to come anyhow as a matter of law. I am urging it now so that I can sit down with him. I know how it is biting on the inside.
Mr. WooD. I am not going to put the committee in a position here, and I don't think any of them want to be placed in the position, of making any compromising statements about what they will do here in any given set of circumstances. I think they can cross that when they arrive at that point.
Mr. MANDEL. I don't intend to argue with the committee any further. I believe I made my point. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2301 
Mr. WOOD. Proceed, counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Parks, are you acquainted with an effort made to raise funds for the New Masses magazine, which was in the form of a party held at the home of Frank Tuttle on June 8, 1945?
Mr. PARKS. No, sir; I don't recall any such party at Frank Tuttle's house. I was at his house I believe only once, and as I remember it there were maybe 2 or 3 people, and it was purely a social evening. This is the best of my recollection. I don't believe to the very best of my recollection of having attended such a party.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have just learned there are two Frank Tuttles in Hollywood. Are you acquainted with that fact?
Mr. PARKs. No. I only know one Frank Tuttle, who is a director in Hollywood.
Mr. TAVENNER. He is the one that I had reference to.
Mr. PARKS. That is the one that I am acquainted with, was acquainted with. I don't know whether he is out there now at this time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend a Comnmumst Party meeting of a cultural group of the Communist Party at the home of Hugo Butler?
Mr. PARKS. I have been to Hugo Butler's house twice, I think. One was on a matter of-I believe I read a script of his. The other time to the best of my recollection was a party given for-as I recall, it was given for the people who had come before your committee in 1947. This is the best of my recollection. I don't recall ever going to a party for-what was it? New Masses ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No. This party that I am speaking of now did not necessarily have anything to do with New Masses. This is a different meeting that I am referring to now at the home of Hugo Butler. It is alleged to have taken place on January 3, 1945.
Mr. PARKS. No, I don't recall going there for a party at that time at all. I am being very honest when I say that. As I say, I know where he lives, and I think I have been there twice.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Hugo Butler a member of the Communist Party, to your knowledge, or from information made available to you?
Mr. PARKS. No, sir, I have no knowledge of Hugo Butler at all being a member.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever attend a Communist Party meeting at which he was present?
Mr. PARKS. Not to my recollection. I never did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Frank Tuttle a member of the Communist Party, to your knowledge?
Mr. PARKS. This, counsel, I do not know. I don't believe I have ever heard that. I don't believe that I have ever to the very best of my knowledge ever attended any meeting of such a nature with Frank Tuttle.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were the members of the cell of the Communist Party to which you were assigned during the period from 1941 on up to the time you disassociated yourself from the party about 1945?
Mr. PARKS. Tlns is what I have been talking about. This is the thing that I am no longer fighting for myself, because I tell you frankly that 1 am probably the most completely ruined man that you have ever seen. I am fighting for a principle. I think, if Americanism is involved in this particular case. This is what I have been talking 31747-53-pt 6 -- 2 2302 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA about. I do not believe that it befits this committee to force me to do this. I do not believe it befits this committee or its purposes to force me to do this. This is my honest feeling about it. I don't think that this is fair play. I don't think it is in the spirit of real Americanism, as we know it. These are not people that are a danger to this country, gentlemen, the people that I knew. These are people like myself.
Mr. TAVENNEE. Mr. Chairman, if the witness refuses to answer the question, I see very little use in my asking him about other individuals.
Mr. WooD. The witness, of course, has got to make up his own mind as to whether he will or will not do it. It isn't sufficient, as far as this committee is concerned, to say that in your opinion it is unfair or unAmerican in the proper administration of justice. The question is: Do you refuse to answer or will you answer it?
Mr. MANDEL. At this point I would like to ask the chairman whether he is directing the witness to answer.
Mr. WooD. The witness has been asked. He must answer or decline to answer.
Mr. MANDEL. I think a little more is needed. He must be directed to answer, and if he refuses to answer, just merely asking him and not going beyond, I don't believe under law is sufficient. I think he has to be directed and told "You have got to answer."
Mr. WOOD. I don't understand any such rule, but in order to avoid any controversy I direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. PARKS. I do not refuse to answer the question, but I do feel that this committee is doing a really dreadful thing that I don't believe the American people will look kindly on. This is my opinion. I don't think that they will consider this as honest, just, and in the spirit of fair play.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, might I interpose at this point? Mr. Parks, we are, each one of us, individually responsible to the American people. I think that our concept of our responsibility or of the extent to which we must answer is a thing which we ourselves are fully conscious of. That determination must rest with the individual members of the committee and the committee as a whole. I for one resent having my duties pointed out to me.
Mr. PARKS. I am not pointing the duty out.
Mr. JACKSON. The inference is that we are doing something which is un-American in nature. That is a personal opinion of yours, and I merely think that it should be in the record. We have accountability for which we must account and for which we must answer.
Mr. WooD. The witness has said he doesn't refuse to answer, so I assume he is ready to answer.
Mr. MANDEL. I may say this at this point: I think the committee and the individual members of the committee are all seeking within themselves to do the right thing. There is no question about that. I think in the same spirit, no one can, with the heritage that Mr. Parks has to uphold, think that he isn't as loyal as any member of this committee, individually or collectively, and that he in his own mind has to do the right thing as we Americans in our elections do and choose. Of course, when the final gong goes down, he intends as he indicated to respect the will of this committee, but I think justly he reserves the right to talk to you gentlemen and possibly persuade you to think differently and express his opinions. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2303 
Mr. Woon. The committee took the view, sir, that perhaps there might be some merit in your contention if we were still in an open hearing, but we are not. It is an executive session.
Mr. MANDEL. I realize that, and I want to thank the committee for this consideration. I think it should have been done first before we started here, but this session is a very private session or executive session, which is very considerate of the committee, and the record should so state. May I have a minute to talk to Mr. Parks?
Mr. WooD. Yes. You may retire if you like.
Mr. MANDEL. I make this request of the committee. I want no promise from you, but just as a matter of finding what is the sportsmanlike attitude, that what lie gives you will not be used in that way if it can be helped, without embarrassing these people in the same position he finds himself in today.
Mr. Woon. Nobody on this committee has any desire to smear the name of anybody. That isn't of benefit to this committee in the discharge of its duties. It has been a uniform custom of the committee since I have been connected with it. I think all of the American people who have viewed the work of the committee dispassionately and impartially will agree with that.
Mr. MANDEL. The reason I asked is because in the struggle that Mr. Parks is going through I think the internal struggle would go a little lighter, having that statement from you.
Mr. TAVENNER. If you will just answer the question, please. The question was: Who were the members of the Communist Party cell to which you were assigned during the period from 1941 until 1945, or the period when you dissolved your membership with the Communist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, Morris Carnovsky, Joe-Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell that name?
Mr. PARKS. I couldn't possibly spell it. Carnovsky, Joe Bromberg, Sam Rossen, Anne Revere, Lee Cobb.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name?
Mr. PARKS. Cobb. Gale Sondergaard, Dorothy Tree. Those are the principal names that I recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of Dorothy Tree's husband? Was it not Michael Uris?
Mr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member?
Mr. PARKS. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether Michael Uris was a member of any other cell of the Communist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. No. I don't know this at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe he was a writer, was he not, as distinguished from an actor ?
Mr. PARKS. I think he was a writer; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. The persons whose names you have mentioned were all actors?
Mr. PARKS. Yes; that's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall the names of others who were at one time a member of that cell .
Mr. PARKS. That's about all I recall right now.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Howard Da Silva a member? 2304 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't believe that I ever attended a meeting with Howard Da Silva.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Howard Da Silva a member of the Communist Party, to your knowledge?
Mr. PARKS. Not to my knowledge. To the best of my ability, I don't believe I ever attended a meeting with him, and I don't recall ever having attended a meeting with him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Roman Bohman a member?
Mr. PARKS. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. He is now deceased, I believe.
Mr. PARKS. He is dead.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was James Cagney a member at any time ?
Mr. PARKS. Not to my knowledge. I don't recall ever attending a meeting with him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party, to your knowledge or from information made available to you?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall ever hearing that he was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Sam Jaffe? 
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall ever attending a meeting with Sam Jaffe.
Mr. TAXENNER. Was lie a llember of the Communist Party, to your knowledge or from information made available to you?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall any knowledge that Sam Jaffe was ever a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. John Garfield?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall ever being at a meeting with Jolm Garfield.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall whether John Garfield ever addressed a Communist Party meeting when you were present?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall any such occasion.
Mr. TAVENNER. Marc Lawrence, was he a member of that cell?
Mr. PARKS. I beheve he was. I wouldn't say with certainty. I believe so.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is there in your memory that leads you to believe that he was a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I told you, I didn't attend very many meetings, and I believe I recall that lie was there. I don't swear to it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was It during the early part or the latter part of your membership that you have that recollection of him?
Mr. PARKS. Well, thli I couldn't say. I really don't remember.
Mr. MANDEL. May I suggest to counsel, in view of the general feeling of the witness-I don't mean to rush you, but this whole thing being so distasteful, I wonder if we can proceed a little faster so he doesn't suffer so much while this is going on.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want hmu to be accurate on it. I purposely do not want to rush him into answering about matters as important as these.
Mr. MANDEL. I didn't infer that and mean that. I am just trying to be considerate of the man's feelings, doing something thatMr. TAVENNER. I asked you this morning about Karen Morley. Was she a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. PARKS. Yes; she was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she in this particular cell that you have described?
Mr. PARKS. Yes; she was. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2305 
Mr. TAVENNER. Richard Collins, were you acquainted with him?
Mr. PARKS. I know Richard Collins. He was not to my knowledge a member of the Communist Party. (At this point Representative Clyde Doyle left the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I have asked you whether or not members of the Communist Party from the eastern part of the United States had appeared before your Communist Party meetings. You said you did not recall that any had.
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. But did Communist Party organizers from the State of California appear before your committee from time to time?
Mr. PARKS. Not to the best of my recollection. I don't believe I ever met any of them or ever saw any of them.
Mr. TAVENKER. Were lectures given at any time or study courses given in your cell in which persons outside of your cell took part?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I believe on one occasion. The only one that I recall at this time was a talk by John Howard Lawson.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was John Howard Lawson's connection with the Communist Party?
Mr. PARKS. I don't really know. I don't really know.
Mr. TAVENNEL. Fred Graff, was he a member of this group?
Mr. PARKS. What was the name?
Mr. TAVENNER. G-r-a-f-f. Fred Graff, usually referred to as Freddie Graff.
Mr. PARKS. The name doesn't ring a bell at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Georgia Backus?
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't recall ever being at a meeting with Georgia Backus.
Mr. TAVENNER. Meta Reis Rosenberg?
Mr. PARKS. I don't believe I know the lady.

Mr. PARKS. No; I don't recall ever being at a meeting with him.

Mr. TAVENNER. Philip Loeb-L-o-e-b?
Mr. PARKS. Who?
Mr. TAVENNER. Philip Loeb I believe is the correct pronunciation.
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't recall I know the gentleman at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Lloyd Gough?
Mr. PARKS. Yes; I believe he was a-I saw him at a couple of meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Sterling Hayden?

Mr. TAVENNER. Victor Killian, Jr.?
Mr. PARKS. I don't believe I am acquainted with the gentleman at all. 2306 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA

Mr. PARKs. No; I don't recall ever -ttending a meeting with Edward G. Robinson.

Mr. TAVENNER. Humphrey Bogart?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall ever attending a meeting with Humphrey Bogart. (At this point Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room.)
Mr. WALTER. I think you could get some comfort out of the fact that the people whose names have been mentioned have been subpoenaed, so that if they ever do appear here it won't be as a result of anything that you have testified to. (At this point Repiesentative Bernard W Kearney left the hearing room.)
Mr. PARKS. It is no comfort whatsoever.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know of any other person now whose name comes to your recollection?
Mr. PARKS. No, I don't recall anyone else.
Mr. TAVENNER. I think that is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. PoaTER. I would like to say, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Parks' testimony has certainly been refreshing in comparison with the other witnesses that we have had today.
Mr. WooD. I am bure you reflect the sentiments of the entire committee. We appreciate your cooperation, and subject to call, the committee will stand in recess. You are excused. Yon do not have to i main here.
Mr. MANuEL. We canl go home now ? He call go back to California? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2307 
Mr. WooD. Any time you like. (Whereupon, at 4: 40 p. m., the hearing was recessed, subject to call.) (By order of the committee the following letters are being included in the record at this point:) JULY 23, 1953 Hon. IIAROLD VELDE, Chatrmwn, House Commtitte on Un-Amerwan Activities, Washington, D. C. DEAR CHAIRMAN VELDi: I ha\e your letter of July 17, and it was so good to hear from you. Pursuant to your suggestion, I'm enclosing a sworn copy of the letter I sent you and also authorize you and your committee to release the testimony I gave Sou in executive session. Again let me take this opportunity to thank you for your consideration, I remain Respectfully, LARY PARKS. (Sworn letter mentioned by Larry Parks in his letter dated July 23, 1953:) JLY 15, 1953. Hon. HAROLD VELDE, Chairman, House Committee on L n-.nwrican Actiirties, sWashinUgto,D. C. DI.A CHAIRMAN VELDE: After careful consideration, I wish to file a clarifying statement of my point of view on the Communist problem with your comimittee. In re-reading my public testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, I am now convinced that it improperly reflects my true attitude toward the malignancy of the Communist Party. If there is any way in which I can further aid in exposing the methods of entrapment and deceit through which Communist conspirators have gained the adherence of Ameican idealists and liberals, I hope the committee will so advise me Perhaps some of the confusion now apparent to me in my testimony before .\ourcommittee can best be explained by the fact that I was the first cooperative witness from Hollywood to appear before your committee and at the time I was under really great strain and tension Upon reflection, I see that I did not adequately express my true beliefs-beliefs which have even deepened and strengthened since my appearance Above all I wish to make it clear that I support completely the objectives of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. I believe fully that Communists nod Communist intrigues should be thoroughly exposed and isolated and thus rendered impotent. In the light of events which have transpired since I appeared as a witness before your committee, it is crystal clear that no one w'io really bell vP 'n a progressive program for humanity can support any part of the Communist program. No true liber.il can doubt that Soviet communism constitutes as grave a threat to the rights of man today as once did Hitler fascism. The most recent attack by the Soviet Army on unarmed German workers makes it crystal clear that fheir interest in labor is only to increase their power. Liberals must now embrace the cause of anticommunism with the same dedication and zeal as we once did that of antinnzism. The enemy is the same though the labels have changed. It is my conviction that to assist your committee in obtaining full information about the Communist Party and its activities is the duty of all who possess such evidence. Certainly, if I were to testify today I would not testify as I did in 1951-that to aive such testimony is to "wallow in the mud." but on the contrary I would recognize that such cooperationn would help further the cause in which many of us were sincerely interested when we were duped into joining and taking part in the Communist Party. My statement about not wanting my sons to become "cows in the pasture" obviously needs clarification. The thought I really meant to convey was that my sons should not become indifferent to the plight of the people less fortunate than themselves. It is my conviction that through sympathetic understanding and aid to the repressed peoples we Americans cannot only best represent Ameriian traditions. but also effectively aid in combating the false power of commu- 2308 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA nism. I want my sons to participate fully in the search for democratic answers to the continuing threat of totalitananism-Communist or Fascist. To that end, I will do all within my power as one who once was duped but has since learned the hard way about the guileful traps which communism can set for an unwary idealist or liberal. I sincerely hope that the committee will publish the statement of my militant anti-Communist beliefs at the earliest possible date. Sincerely, LARBYPARKS.

EXECUTIVE STATEMENT' An executive statement, given at 10 a. m., June 2, 1953, at room 1107, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. STATEMENT OF CHARLOTTE DARLING ADAMS
Mr. WHEELER. You are Charlotte Darling Adams?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; I am. 
Mr. WHEELER. You are the same person who testified before the committee on March 26, 1953, in Los Angeles?
Mrs. ADAMS. I am.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you accompanied by counsel?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I am not.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you desire counsel?
Mrs. ADAMS. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently under subpena?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I am not.
Mr. WHEELER. You are giving this statement voluntarily ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; I am.
Mr. WHEELER. Your appearance before the committee on March 26, 1953, you testified you joined the Communist Party in approximately 1936 and left the Communist Party in 1946. In your appearance of March you were not asked in detail the identity of individuals you met as Communists. At this time we will begin in 1936, and if possible, in chronological order, list the Communist Party groups to which you were assigned and identify the individuals you met as Communists. Now, do you recall to what group you were first assigned in 1936?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. I was assigned to a mixed group of studio workers.
Mr. WHEELER. What type of employment did the members of this group engage in in the motion-picture industry ?
Mrs. ADAMS. They were all sorts of people. Mostly craft workers and technicians and musicians. I really don't know the complete setup of it because I attended only two meetings. 2Released by the full committee 2309 31747-53-pt 6-3 2310 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Now, who recruited you into the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. Ed Gilbert.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of the individuals of this first group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Not very many of them. There was Ed Gilbert, of course, and Frank Drdrlik.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Mr. Gilbert's occupation?
Mrs. ADAMS. He was a set designer.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Mr. Drdrlik's occupation?
Mrs. ADAMS. He was also a set designer.
Mr. WHEELER. Those are the two individuals you recall in this first group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you subsequently transferred to another group ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; I was. The three of us were transferred to another group.
Mr. WHEELER. What type of group was that?
Mrs. ADAMS. This was a group of what were considered craft workers, set designers, and cartoonists, supposed to be, and I believe there were some teamsters. This was supposed to be all of the back-lot workers who were not technicians.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you remain with the second group?
Mrs. ADAMS. About 2 years.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, do you recall the Identity of the individuals that comprised this thing?
Mrs. ADAMS Well, there was Don Gordon.
Mr. WHEELER. A reader?
Mrs. ADAMS. I think so. And Drdrlik and Gilbert, Henry Peterson, a carpenter. Hjalman Peterson; also a carpenter. Father and son, and the father is Hjalmar. Joe Kromberger. He was an electrician. Sam Cloner.
Mr. WIIEELER. Do you recall his occupation?
Mrs. ADAMS. A laborer.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall approximately how many individuals comprised the second group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Oh, about 6 or 7; it varied. One or two people would come in and maybe so many would leave.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the purpose of this group or the main program set forth by it?
Mrs. ADAMS. It was a trade union group. Most everyone in it was working in organization of unions.
Mr. WHEELER. Most individuals were members of the IATSE?
Mrs. ADAiS. No. These were people outside of the IATSE. Kromberger, for instance, was a member of the IBEW. Cloner, the laborers, while they were in the IA, I think.
Mr. WHEELER. What union did you belong to at that time ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, ours was an independent guild.
Mr. WHEELER. Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any office in the Screen Cartoonists' Guild at that time ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. I was secretary.
Mr. WHEELER. What year was that?
Mrs. ADAMS. 1936-37. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2311 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you president of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I am not presidential material.
Mr. WIIEELER. Now, after you left the second group in 1939, were you assigned to a third group ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. The third group was cartoonists.
Mr. WHEELER. Cartoonists?
Mrs. ADAMs. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. This was in approximately 1939?
Mrs. AnDAs. It was a very small group.
Mr. WIIEELER. How long did you remain a member of this cartoonists' group ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Until I got married in 1941; it was several years.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say you were a member of it up to 1941?
Mrs. ADAu.s. Well, yes, through 1941.
Mr. WIEELER. How many individuals were members of the cartoonists' group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Four or five or six. There were a few wives, Libby Hilberman. and Dave Hilberman.
Mr . WiIEELER. Were all the members of this group also members of tile Screen Cartoonists' Guild
Mrs. ADANMS.Well, no. Part of them were. The wives were also members.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any position in this group of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAs. Oh, I don't know. I think that from time to time I did things, like literature and membership and dues, organization for a little while, but I wasn't very good at it.
Mr. WHIFELER. Was this group active in formulating the policy of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, yes, in a way. It was mainly in support of the organization. We influenced what policy we could.
Mr. WHEELER. During this period of time, did you ever have occasion to meet Jeff Kibre ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Oh, yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Jeff Kibre as a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall his position at that time with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. ADAMS. I don't know what he was called, but I rather imagine he was the organizer for the Hollywood studios. I would think that is what his title would be.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say he was organizer of the labor groups in the studios?
Mrs. ADArs. He also apparently, although I don't know this of my own knowledge he apparently also worked with the talent groups, too.
Mr. WHEELER Did he ever attend any meetings of your group of the Screen Cartooni its' Guild ?
Mrs. ADAMS. No. He met with a fraction. This was probably in about 1939.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who else were members of this cartoonists' group, other than Libby and David Hilbernan ? 2312 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. ADAMS. They did not ever meet with Kibre while I was there.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who were the other members of the cartoonists' group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Oh, a fellow by the name of Phil Klein.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where he was employed ?
Mrs. ADAMS. No, I don't. I didn't know him very well.
Mr. WHEELER. Anyone else ?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I can't remember any others.
Mr. WHEELER. In your testimony you mentioned you attended fraction meetings, at which time you met Jeff Kibre.
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Would you go into greater detail with reference to these meetings?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, it seems that one incident I remember very well because it caused me a lot of trouble, was that the Screen Writers' Guild had an attorney named Leonard Janofsky.
Mr. WHEELER. In what way did this Leonard Janofsky cause you trouble?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, Jeff Kibre opposed Leonard Janofsky as attorney for the Screen Writers' Guild because he didn't go along with the party line in relation to the Screen Writers' Guild policy.
Mr. WHEELER. Was any effort made by Jeff Kibre to remove Janofsky from his position with the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; Janofsky took a position as attorney for the Independent Union of Cartoonists at Disney's Studios. Kibre was opposed to this union because it was considered an outlaw union and wouldn't affiliate with the existing union in the cartoonists, and took steps to eliminate Janofsky from his position as attorney in the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. WHEELER. What steps did Kibre take in eliminating or having Janofsky fired from the Screen Writers' Guild ?
Mrs. ADAMS. He wrote a letter and I signed it.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the text of this letter, as well as you remember?
Mrs. ADAMS. It pointed out to the board of the Screen Writers' Guild that Janofsky was not a suitable representative for them, was not a good trade unionist because he was representing an outlaw union, which was organizing opposition to what we considered a legitimate union.
Mr. WHEELER. You state that you signed this letter.
Mrs. ADAMS. I signed it; yes.
Mr. WHEELER. You were at that time secretary of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What position did Kibre have with the Screen Cartonnists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. No position.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this, in your opinion, a direct Communist Party directive?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; it was.
Mr. WHEELER. Was it considered to the best interest of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. Do you mean I considered it that COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2313 
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Mrs. ADAMs. No; I don't think it was, because it alienated a large group of cartoonists at Disney's.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you place your membership in the Communist Party over your position as secretary of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mr. ADAMS. That is hard to say, Mr. Wheeler. I don't think I really did, although that is looking at it in retrospect. My reason for joining the party was to organize the union. Consequently, I believe that the union was more important to me.
Mr. WHEELER. But yet you would lend yourself to directives of the functionary of the Communist Party?
Mr. ADAMS. Well, as I said, I believe in my testimony downtown, my previous testimony before the committee, I joined the party because I knew nothing about organization and it was the place to get information. Since my basic reason for joining was to organize cartoonists, I do feel that the cartoonists' union was more important to me than the party itself.
Mr. WHEELER. When was the Screen Cartoonists' Guild first organized ?
Mrs. ADAMS. The first organization was in 1936.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Jeff Kibre have any voice in it at that time ?
Mrs. ADAMs. No; he didn't.
Mr. WHEELER. Did he subsequently have a voice in it?
Mrs. ADAMs. Very little, because his attitude was a little too extreme to us to direct cartoonists.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you confer with Kibre on problems that arose in the industry, in the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMs. Yes; I conferred with him and I took nonparty members with me to confer with him.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any occasion where you took opposition to Mr. Kibre's decision in a matter, or his advice ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, yes. I can remember occasions on which it was necessary, because his point of view wasn't practical.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any specific instance ?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I don't. I just remember that very often his advice was confusing. When issues came up in the Screen Cartoonists' Guild they were acted upon very often from the floor or by the executive board. And while I influenced them where I could, I didn't give too much opposition to the democratic processes.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall any other instances in which you lent yourself as secretary of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild to carry out other decisions or directives of Jeff Kibre ?
Mrs. ADAMS. I participated in an unemployment conference within the studios.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you further explain what the unemployment conference was?
Mrs. ADAMS. It was a legitimate organization, to do research into the unemployment situation in the studios.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the officers of this organization?
Mrs. ADAMs. I believe Herbert Sorrell was president. It seems to me he was.
Mr. WHEELER. What year was this? 2314 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. ADAMS. 1939.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, did Jeff Kibre have a voice in this organization ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; he was representative from the prop makers.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a representative from the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. I was a representative from the Screen Cartoonists' Guild. We had two delegates.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the other one?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; the other was Ted Pierce. He was not a party member.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the other delegates from the other various unions?l
Mrs. ADAMS. There was Frank Drdrhk, who was a delegate, and Ed Mussa.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he a Communist, do you know?
Mrs. ADAMS. No. I believe Ed Gilbert was a delegate; Ben Martinez, of the plasterers. These are not Communists; Jules Scacerieux, a plasterer. There were several writers. Francis Goodrich and Albert Hackett were writers. There were some people from the office employees. Virginia Kibre, Jeff Kibre's wife, was there. There were several directors, Harry Herrick. I believe Herbert Biberman was a member of that conference, of the directors. I knew none of these individuals to be members of the Communist Party, except the ones I previously testified to. Most of them were simply interested in solving the unemployment problem.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you elected a delegate to this-what was the name of it?
Mrs. ADAMS. Studio Unemployment Conference, at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you elected from the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes; I was elected a delegate.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the members of the Communist Party, who were also delegates to this Studio Unemployment Conference, have fraction meetings or discuss what policies should be formulated?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you able to control the Studio Unemployment Conference to any degree?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, controlled it to the degree that the policies were so fantastic it fell apart. We did make a survey of the unemployment situation in the studios, and Jeff Kibre, at a fraction meeting, suggested we have a mass meeting at the Hollywood Bowl. Most of us thought that was a little fantastic, those of us in the fraction. He prevailed on us to do it, and it was a collossal flop.
Mr. WHEELER. What other policies were set forth by the fraction that you considered to be fantastic that led to the falling apart of this conference?
Mrs. ADAMs. I couldn't generally say. I think the Hollywood Bowl fiasco was the last straw, actually.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you able to get the non-Communist members of this conference to agree to the policies as set forth by the fraction?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. Drdrlik brought the question up. He was the COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2315 one who was to bring it up. He had a lot of friends in the conference meeting, as he has a lot of friends every place usually. He made it seem like it would be a very good Hollywood thing to do, it would appeal to people.
Mr. WHEELER. How is it that a small group of Communists are able to control a whole body where they are outnumbered ?
Mrs. ADAMS. I think because Communists are the most active members of the union, usually. They work the hardest, and they give more time.
Mr. WEELER. Were the other members of this unemployment conference conscious of the Communist infiltration of it?
Mrs. ADAMS. I don't think so, to any degree. I would think some of them might have suspected it, but where you feel that people agree with you, you are inclined to say, "Well, so what do their politics matter ?" At least, at the time that was the feeling.
Mr. WHIEELER. The overall objective of the conference was for the good of the-Mrs. ADAMS. For the good of the motion-picture industry, the working people in the motion-picture industry. It could have done some good but was badly directed.
Mr. WHEELER. You didn't attain any positive results from the conference?
Mrs. ADAMS. No, because we couldn't get any agreement on what to do about it. The feeling was that maybe the work could be spread out so there wouldn't be so much unemployment, people who were employed could work less and those who were unemployed could get a few days' work instead of no work at all. But that is a very hard thing to get the membership of the union to agree upon.
Mr. WHEELER. TO get back to the former attorney of the Screen Writers' Guild, Mr. Janofsky, do you recall what action was taken by the Screen Writers' Guild after the receipt of the letter that Jeff Kibre wrote and you signed and sent to the guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. They fired him.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know who was on the board of the Screen Writers' Guild at that time?
Mrs. ADAMS. No, I didn't know anyone on the board.
Mr. WHEELER. Actually what this amounts to in the Communist PartyMrs. ADAMS. Kibre was actually a sort of liaison person between the Screen Writers' Guild and the talent guilds and the craft unions.
Mr. WHEELER. You say the Communist Party was liaison between the Communist Party in these guilds?
Mrs. ADAsts. That is right. I didn't mean he was important to the other people besides Communists.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Kibre, then, as a functionary of the Communist Party, was able to remove this attorney because he was in opposition to the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. During this period of time that we are presently talking about, 1939, Germany and Russia entered into a nonaggression pact; do you recall that?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall your reaction to the nonagression pact ? 2316 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, chagrin, because as far as I was concerned at the time I felt that there were no two ideologies more diametrically opposed than nazism and communism. The whole party line had been in opposition to Hitler and to Mussolini and to Franco.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you bring yourself in a position to accept it?
Mrs. ADAMs. Well, we felt that because the Soviet Union was a country surrounded by capitalist countries that this pact with Germany was an expedient.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who explained this sudden twist in party line to you?
Mrs. ADAMS. I don't remember who did that. 
Mr. WHEELER. However, you did accept fully this change in the line?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. You also recall several years later that when Ger- many attacked Russia there was again a sudden change? 
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how you reacted to the breaking of the pact?
Mrs. ADAMS. As far as I was concerned, I got the feeling that other people felt the same way. There was never a feeling of trust for the Nazis simply because there was a nonaggression pact, that it was a kind of a holding off. Further, that whoever discussed this in 1939, to us, this was to stall the present danger, and only proved that they were correct.
Mr. WHEELE. Mrs. Adams, I believe we have discussed your Communist Party membership up to approximately 1942. Do you recall if during that period of time you were transferred to another unit of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. At about this time I got married, in the fall of 1941. I continued on with the cartoonists until, oh, about the beginning of 1942. Then I quit work and I continued for a little while, it seems to me, in the cartoonists, and I met for a short period of time with the lab technicians because my husband was a lab technician. He didn't want to go into the party and it was a very unhappy period. I introduced him to a couple of members. He didn't like them and we had lots of arguments about it. I was transferred a little bit later to a group in Burbank.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this lab technicians' group?
Mrs. ADAMS. A couple of months or so.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how many individuals were in the technicians' group ?
Mrs. ADAMS. It wasn't a very big group. I believe it was mostly technicolor people.
Mr. WHEsLER. DO you recall who these individuals were?
Mrs. ADAMS. No, because I didn't work with them and they used party names. I remember a Hank Morley because he used his right s g name. Most of them used party names.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the individuals' party names?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was chairman of this group?
Mrs. ADAMs. No. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2317 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the individuals you introduced your husband to?
Mrs. ADAMS. Norville Crutcher.
Mr. WHEELER. Anybody else?
Mrs. ADAMS. There was a big obnoxious guy. I can't remember what his name was. He was the last straw, so far as my husband was concerned; just couldn't stand him. He was with technicolor.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals were members of this lab technicians' group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Oh, 5 or 6 or 7.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Julian Gordon being a member?
Mrs. ADAMS. I don't remember him. He may have been a member. I didn't remember when I saw him at the hearing.
Mr.WHEELER. Were you subsequently transferred to another group ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What was this group?
Mrs. ADAMS. It was at a neighborhood group in Burbank.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the neighborhood group in Burbank?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, I was a member for, oh, well, 6 months, but I didn't attend meetings regularly.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the individuals who were members of this group ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, I remember a girl named Thelma Bachelis.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Mrs. Bachelis' occupation?
Mrs. ADAMS. She was an attorney, I believe.
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings did you attend while assigned to the Burbank group?
Mrs. ADAMS. To the best of my recollection, about 4 or 5.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals were members of this club?
Mrs. ADAMS. There must have been 10 or 12.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any of the other individuals?
Mrs. ADAMS. NO; I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall at whose homes you met?
Mrs. ADAMS. NO. We alternated, I remember. It was always at a different place.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you employed in the motion-picture industry at that time?
Mrs. ADAMS. No; I wasn't. 
Mr. WHEELER. After you left the Burbank group, were you assigned to another club?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, yes. Late in 1943, I believe, I went back to work.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you employed at that time ?
Mrs. ADAMS. At Universal Pictures.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you reaffiliate with a motion-picture group of the Communist Part ?
Mrs. ADAMS. es; I did.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Until I dropped out in 1946.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members were?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, there was a Kate Lawson, who was the wife of John Howard Lawson. Edward Biberman, a painter. Eugene 31747-53-pt. 6-4 2318 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA Fleury, a teacher and artist. Bernice Fleury. also a teacher and artist. David Hilberiman, Libby Hilberman. David Hilberman was a cartoonist.
Mr. WHEELER. Libby Hilberman ?
Mrs. ADAMS. His wife. John Hubley, a cartoonist. Cecil Beard, cartoonist. Edwina Pomerance, William Pomerance, who was only in briefly. Zachery Schwartz, who was only in for a short period of time.
Mr. WHEELER. I would like the record to show at this point Eugene Fluery, Bernice Fluery, and Zachery Schwartz have all testified before the Committee on Un-American Activities as cooperative witnesses. You mentioned the name of William Pomerance.
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did he at one time have an official position with the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAMS. He was business agent.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Communist Party have any voice in the appointment of William Pomerance as business agent of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mrs. ADAM. Indirectly, I suppose, but lie was actually recommended by the Pacific Coast Labor Bureau.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who-Mrs. ADAMS. He was a board examiner for the National Labor Relations Board at one time, I believe. When he stopped working with the Board.
Mr. WHEELER. Were any other business agents of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild members of the Communist Party, to your knowledge?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, Morrie Howard.
Mr. WIEELER. Maurice Howard?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. He succeeded William Pomerance; is that right?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Where did you meet Maurice Howard as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. ADAMS. In the Screen Cartoonists' Guild.
Mr. WHEELER. As a cartoonist?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Was he in one of your groups?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What group would you place him in ?
Mrs. ADAMS. He was in this group.
Mr. WHEELER. He was in the last group to which you were assigned
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. Later on that was, I mean he wasn'tMr. WHEELER. Was he a member of this group when you left?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, he was.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of this later group or any group to which you were assigned?
Mrs. ADAMS. No. I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you dues secretary at any time of the last group?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, I was for a short period of time.
Mr. WHEELER. You collected dues from all these individuals you have mentioned ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2319 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you gave the dues?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. I gave them to Naomi Robison.
Mr. WHEELER. During the time you were a member of the Communist Party, did you ever have occasion to meet Paul Perlin as a Communist?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. I don't remember in which group I met him.
Mr. W\IEELER. It was in one of your groups?
Mrs. AD.\is. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say it was in one of the groups?
Mrs. AuAss. It was very early. It may have been in this first group, but I am not quite sure whether I met him in the beginninghe used to take me to parties and things once in a while. So I don't remember whether I met him at parties or where I met him, actually, within the party group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever have occasion to meet Mary Nolan as a meiibler of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. She may have come along with Ed. Wasn't that the husband's name?
Mr. WHEELER. Frank.
Mrs. ADAMS. She may have come along with hun. I remember I saw her at union meetings quite often.
Mr. WHEELER. But not as a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. I believe she was a member for a short period of time and dropped out.
Mr. WHEELER. After you left the Communist Party in 1946, did anyone endeavor to resolicit your membership?
Mrs. AnD s. No.
Mr. WHEEIER. You have had no contact with the members of the Communist Party since that date?
Mrs. ADAMS. No, I haven't; casually, to say hello, perhaps.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have any specific reason why you left the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes. I got tired of being told what to do. For an example, at that time I was secretary of the Community Homes, a housing co-op, which I considered an important activity. After I quit work it was suggested to me that I should resign as secretary of the Community Homes and come back into the Screen Cartoonists' Guild. It was suggested to me by someone in the party that I should go back to work and rejoin the cartoonists' union and drop out of the Community Homes, because they did not consider it an important enough activity for me.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there a little more than a suggestion by this party person?
Mrs. ADAMs. Yes. I said, "I have no intention of going back to work. I have my family to consider."
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who asked you to resume your work in the studios and stop your work in the Community Homes?
Mrs. ADAMs. I know it was a woman. I am not just sure who. It was someone from the group. It may have been Mrs. Howard.
Mr. WHEELER. That is Mrs. Maurice Howard?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her name?
Mrs. ADAMS. Evelyn. 2320 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Evelyn Howard was also a Communist Party member
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what your reaction was to this?
Mrs. ADAMS. I said, "I have no intention on going back to work. I have too much to do at home and I feel that Community Homes is a good activity that is related to my family." She said, "You will go back to work." I said, "No, I won't." That was all. I said, "I am through with the party. I don't want to have anything to do with it. Don't call me again. I am through."
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have anything additional you would like to add for the record at this time ?
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, just that dropping out of the party was not a sudden thing. Over the last year or two that I was a member I had become increasingly disillusioned with it, actually.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall at this time any other individual you met to be a member of the Communist Party, whether it was a fraction meeting, group meeting, or any other type of meeting, that could be construed as pure Communist?
Mrs. ADAMS. No, I really don't. There were many meetings where there was a mixture of people who were communistic people, who were not Communists. I couldn't be sure enough to name any of those people.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have anything additional you want to put in?
Mrs. ADAMS. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. I am sure that the committee will find your statement of great interest, Mrs. Adams. Thank you very much. (Whereupon the interrogation of Charlotte Darling Adams was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-PART 6 TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMIrrEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVrTES, Hollywood, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT An executive statement given at 1: 30 p. m., June 2, 1953, at room 117 Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. STATEMENT OF ROLAND WILLIAM KIBBEE
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state your full name?
Mr. KIBBEE. Roland William Kibbee.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you born and when ? 
Mr. KIBBEE. February 15, 1941; Monongahela, Pa.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently under subpena ?
Mr. KIBBEE. I am not.
Mr. WHEELER. You are giving this statement of your own free will?
Mr. KIBBEE. I am.
Mr. WHEELER. You realize that by giving this statement does not eliminate the possibility of your being called before the committee in the future?
Mr. KIBBEE. I do.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party, Mr. Kibbee?
Mr. KImBEE. I have. 
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first join the Communist Party?
Mr. KIBBEE. In 1937, to the best of my memory.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you remain a member?
Mr. KIBBEE. For a period of approximately 2 years.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you previously discussed your party member- ship with me ?
Mr. KIBEE. Yes, sir; I have.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe the records show that we had such a dis- cussion on December 14, 1951.
Mr. KIBEE. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you relate how you became a member of the Communist Party? SReleased by the full committee. 2321 2322 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes. I was unemployed at the time, to the best of my memory, quite frustrated and dissillusioned as a young writer. I think that I had a tendency to find fault with the world rather than with myself, and I had radical social ideas, if you will. I had been unemployed in Hollywood, and I was not well connected in Hollywood. I had never been a film writer or worked in the motion-picture industry, but an agent in town became interested in an ,dea for a play that I had, and he financed me while I wrote the play. It amounted to about $25 a week for a year. I was then in those days what was known as a working writer, and $25 a week went a long way. I began to go to meetings of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League which was then a very popular organization in Hollywood, broadly attended, at any rate, and Communists were very much in evidence, and I came to know a group of people in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League wha I later came to know as Communists. They seemed to me to be the most outspoken, the most organized, and I had strong anti-Nazi leanings. They seemed to me to be the leaders in that regard. Although, as I say, psychologically I think I was in a state of mind of where radical ideas appealed to me generally, 1 went. I believe, to open meetings at first, or so-called open meetings, lnch involved this group of people. As nearly as I can make out, the first meeting I recall going to which comes to mind as a Communist meeting was in the home of Budd Schulberg. That may not have been the first one I went to, but it seems to me that it was, and I think the home stands out in my mind, because it was the home of someone of wealth, which is something that I was not familiar with. As nearly as I could make out, the part of the Communist Party that I saw in Hollywood at that time was partly a social organization. It didn't seem to devote any great attention to security. I don't know that I was screened before I came in. As I remember it, if one wanted someone to join, one brought along a friend and introduced him around, and in the normal course of events he was in if he chose to be in.
Mr. WHEELER. You mentioned the words "social organizations." Do you think that may have been a deceptive characterization of it after what transpired ?
Mr. KImBEE. I think this, Mr. Wheeler: I think that that may have leen the appeal made to the people in Hollywood at that time. I think that the appeal of the Communist Party at that time may have been its informality. I don't know what directives came from a higher echelon in the East and so forth and so on and whether or not they foresaw the tense situation that would eventually exist in the kind of a party your own hearings have demonstrated came into being in Hollywood. Certainly a lot of them were not loath to have a drink during meetings and that sort of thing. The memories that stick in my mind mostly are social to some extent, but I think I can explain that this might not have been true throughout the party in Hollywood. Shall I just ramble on for a moment? It is a little hard to organize this that way. One of the reasons I say I was not employed and I was not well connected in Hollywood, and I was therefore to a large extent ineffective from a Communist Party point of view. Most of the COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2323 activities then seemed to be confined to fund raising, some of it directly, for the Communist Party, a good deal of it for organizaStions that since that day have come to be known as front organizations, organizations which the Communists played a leading role in or which they financed to a large extent with funds collected in Hollywood. Not having any funds of my own and not being able to approach people, which was an assignment frequently dished out, I was pretty much left out of that sort of thing. Since there were others like myself, when I joined, I remember you were given a choice of inner party or extra party work, extra party work meaning just what I have covered now, that you go out around and utilize your contacts and your general effectiveness in the Hollywood community in behalf of the party and its causes. Inner party work was more a theoretical matter. You read books. You read a lot of literature. You were expected to report to the unit that you belonged to on various pamphlets and book, and novels and treatises and so forth and so on. That is what I (hd mostly at that tune, so that the social aspects of it may have been exaggerated in my mind, because I really avasn't out working with what were known as fractions in other organizations. I think it is curious, but I believe it is true that I never belonged to any of the outside organizations at all at that tnie.
Mr. WHEELER. Was the anti-Nazi appeal that was being made in the party at that time to solicit new members made to you?
Mr. KIBBEE. That certainly was an appeal to solicit new members. That went almost without saying, the Communist Party was so vociferous at that time in that respect. This was before the so-called phony war that came on later. It was a combination of things. They said if you wanted to fight depression, which still existed to some extent, if you wanted economic equality-I would say that on the international level it was anti-Nazi appeal; on a national level it was a strong trade union appeal, pro-CIO, which was in a period of organization, and that sort of thing.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you leave the Communist Party prior to the signing of the Stalin-Hitler Pact
Mr. KIBEE. Yes. That is the only mark I have of when I left it, because, as I think I remarked to you once before, I remember my sense of relief to this day that I didn't have to go around making an explanation of how these two people had been able to sign a pact, and 1 knew the Reds did have to go around making it, because you heard it around. That is one of the ways that I have been able to mark a formal departure from it, because there was relatively no formality in either my entrance or departure that I have been able to recall. I really drifted in. In the sense of any type of organization, I don't believe there was an oath. I am sure there wasn't, as a matter of fact. I don't think there was any ceremony. I think they said, "This is
Mr. Kibbee, and this is so and so," and you already had a nodding acquaintance with these people because you usually went into a unit you did know about, and that was pretty much the extent of it. When I left it was on a similarly informal basis. I know I drifted out for some time. Then somebody called me, I suppose the unit chairman or something, of that sort, to come back, and I said no, and I either asked for or was summoned to or an appointment was 2324 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA arranged, and I have never been able to remember with whom, Buchman or John Howard Lawson, but I know I had a conversation with this individual in which I said it wasn't for me, and I remember one argument, the accusation that I had no faith in the American people, and that was why I was leaving. The person who said it, if it was Lawson or Buchman, meant it in quite a different way, but it was quite close to the truth because one of the things that bothered me was the party's assumption, "You see it and hear it, that the American people were with them 100 percent," and you couldn't adjust this with the reality outside. You could feel that way sometimes among a group of Communists or left-wing parties, but when you were in my position, doing odd jobs around town and not in the Hollywood media, you would discover that the American people were not pro-Communists, and you found yourself keeping quiet about your own affiliations, because you were a little embarrassed about it when you heard their own views and how they felt about it.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall who solicited your membership?
Mr. KIBBEE. That has been almost impossible for me to determine in terms of one specific individual. I can remember a group now of 7 or 8 people, and I know that it must have been somebody in that group. I have to presume it was somebody. In this case, I would have to say that the solicitation of membership in my case must have been that individual who first asked me to attend an open meeting. If somebody said point blank, "I would like you to join the Communist Party," and I suppose that must have happened, it would be lost in my mind now as to who it was. I can narrow it down to a group of people, a half a dozen or so, one of whom it must have been. I have been in the position of asking Richard Collins when I saw him if it was he, which it might have been, who is one of the first men I ever met in those days.
Mr. WHEELER. After you joined the Communist Party were you assigned to a branch or a unit ?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes, immediately. I began to meet with the unit, I believe, who were holding the open meetings that I went to.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you belong to one unit during your period of membership or more ?
Mr. KIBBEE. To the best of my memory, I was never transferred, but the unit, I remember, changed personalities. People drifted into other kinds of work. There was some small effort made to keep the units filled with people who were in one line of endeavor, I believe, in Hollywood, I believe writers or actors, perhaps, and since I was unemployed and only a self-proclaimed writer, there never was any reason to change me. It is possible, I would be willing to say, that in any case I wouldn't have moved through more than two units. I think it would have stuck in my mind had I done so, had I been transferred.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to a writers' branch of the party?
Mr. KIBBEE. I cannot say for sure. Most of the people in it were writers, although I recall one actor now offhand.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who were in the unit? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2325 
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes, pretty closely. I don't know that they were all in when I joined it, but during the course of time that I was in it I met in the unit with Maurice Rapf, Richard Collins, Ring Lardner, Jr. I went to a unit meeting once, I am sure, at the home of James Dow, who was a collaborator with Arnaud D'Usseau. Whether Arnaud D'Usseau was in the meeting or the unit at the time, it is hard to recall now. I recognize him as one of the larger group. A great many of them were that I actually did not meet. May I consult a card here, because I have got some of this written down? Jeff Kibre, I know at one unit I was in, and Mr. Kibre was one of the very first men I met in that period who identified himself to me as a Communist. Whether he was a member of that unit or not is very difficult for me to say. To the best of my recollection he had been a writer, but was at that time already involved in some kind of trade union work, I think, at the harbor. I don't think he met regularly with us, but I have a very clear impression of meeting Kibre in the framework of a closed Communist Party meeting. Betty Anderson, who I believe today-I haven't seen her for a number of years, but I believe her name today is Mrs. Wilson, the same girl. I think George Bassman I met in a unit, although Mr. Bassman is confused in my mind with a number of gambling parties that I attended at his house, I am sorry to say. I am not positive, but I considered Bassman a member of the Communist Party at that time, I know.
Mr. Lawson and Mr. Buchman I have already mentioned. I know I listened to Samuel Ornitz delivering the party line. Whether or not it applies to a unit meeting or a closed party meeting, I don't know. He often spoke to broader groups, and it might have well been a broader group. I don't think he was a regular member of my unit. I know that I met a writer named Paul Trivers in my unit at one time or another, and I also met Waldo Salt as a Communist in matters pertaining to an organization, a front organization that was then the darling of the Communist Party, called the Committee to Aid Agricultural Workers. It had to do with the people from Oklahoma who were in the San Joaquin Valley. That was, I am sure, a unit meeting. As a matter of fact, I haven't been able to remember any meetings except unit meetings. I don't think there were any other meetings except the people who were in higher positions or special positions, chairmen of units, I know, who met separately. After the unit meetings on other nights or something of that sort, other officials met together or fractions met together, but because of the rather in-and-out connection I had at that time, I missed out on a lot of meetings that were not unit meetings that could be accurately described as closed meetings of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any position at all in your unit?
Mr. KIBBEE. I don't believe I ever did, although the units at that time were half a dozen or 8 people, and usually I do remember there were almost enough jobs to go around. For instance, a job might be classified as publicity director or educational director or treasurer. It might entail at that time no more than collecting the dues around 31747-5S--pt. 6-- 2326 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA the room or picking up the literature and bringing it to the meeting or delivering a report on a particular phase. And I might very well have held a job of that sort. The only job in the unit that meant anything in terms of rank as we know it was the chairman of the unit, the sort of lieutenant of the platoon, if you will. That job I did not hold.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who did hold that job?
Mr. KIBBEE. It would be hard for me to say. I would be making a pretty good guess if I said that Richard Collins did. I would rather not guess. I am not sure who was the chairman. I am also not sure that it was not rotated occasionally in some form or other, that you didn't serve for say several months and then give over to somebody else so that somebody else would get the experience in that sort of thing.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay dues?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes, I must have. I had a card with stamps. I remember that.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the amount of the dues?
Mr. KIBBEE. I paid unemployed dues because I was mostly unemployed. That was some nominal fee, perhaps 50 cents or a dollar a month. I was for a time a radio announcer at KFVD during that period at a very low salary. No matter what it was-I think 20 or 25 dollars a week-I would have been obliged to pay some percentage of that. I must have paid dues or I couldn't have continued as a member.
Mr. WHEELER. You were aware of the system of paying a percentage of salary ?
Mr. KIBBEE. I believe I was aware of it at that time. I believe people paid a percentage of their salary by request.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you continue with the membership of the unit?
Mr. KIBBEE. Well, I think I have run over the names of the people that I met within units that I am able to recall. I have a couple of question marks. I have Harold Buchman's name here with a question mark. I have been unable to remember whether or not he sat in the unit with me, whether or not he was a member of the same unit. My impression is that lie was. At the meeting at Waldo Salt's house the name stands out in my mind of Luke Hinman. He was not a Hollywoodite. He was a tradeunion organizer. The best grip I can get on it is that he kind of briefed us about this situation in the San Joaquin Valley. I believe lie was associated with the Cannery Workers Union.
Mr. WHEELER. How would you spell his name?
Mr. KIBBEE. I would spell it H-i-n-m-a-n, and the first name Luke, L-u-k-e. I don't know that I have ever seen it in print. That is the way it stands out in my mind. It was, to the best of my knowledge, not a closed Communist Party meeting. This was a unit meeting, I am sure, in which we were briefed on that situation in the San Joaquin Valley, and what was expected of us.
Mr. WHEELER. Martin Berkeley identified you on Septemberl9, 1951, as a member of the Communist Party. Do you recall him as being a member? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2327 
Mr. KIBBEE. I have seen Mr. Berkeley and spoken with him since he testified, not long ago, as a matter of fact, of trying to put these things together. We both agreed that we had not been members of the same unit, that we had been exposed to each other within the framework of the Communist Party, and as I said earlier in the testimony, I don't contradict Mr. Berkeley's word. I simply have not been able to put my finger on the exact specific situation in which we met.
Mr. Berkeley's recollection is, I know, he told me, that I had attended a writers' fraction meeting on race relations This is possible. I was not a qualified writer. It is certainly possible, as a self-proclaimed writer, I would have been at something of that sort, but I don't know with what organization.
Mr. WHEELER. Miss Isobel Lennart, on May 20, 1952, in her public testimony before the committee, also identified you as a onetime member of the Communist Party. Do you recall her as a member?
Mr. KIBBEE. I met Miss Lennart at that time. I am sorry to say I do not clearly recall her as a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe on the date that Mr. Berkeley testified you were in Italy engaged in motion-picture work.
Mr. KmBBE. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. And upon receipt of the information that you had been so identified, you sent a telegram to the committee.
Mr. KIBBEE. I did.
Mr. WHEELER. I quote this telegram for the record: To the best of my recollection joined 1937 left 1939 No afbliation since then. Promise testify immediately upon return scheduled late November. Signed Roland Kibbee. Do you recall having met anyone else as a member of the Communist Party either at a fraction meeting, cell meeting, or any type of meeting that was comprised only of individuals who were Communists ?
Mr. KIBBEE. Mr. Wheeler, in terms of my own convictions, there are several names that have been exposed before the committee. Some of the people have been cooperative themselves, whom I am sure that I met within the framework of the Communist Party, men like Herbert Biberman, for example, whom I listened to delivering lectures and party-line material, who perhaps visited a fraction. I believe a man named Lou Harris was an official at that time, and there are several others of that sort, but over the span of 15 years it Ir:s been extremely difficult for me to try and find out the origin of that meeting of my first encounter with them.
Mr. WIEELER. I believe in your testimony you previously mentioned an actor.
Mr. KIBBEE. That's right. I know a member of my group, an actor by the name of Maurice Murphy was a member of the group, I tried to place before. It has now become interlarded with a group that was not actually a part of that group that I perhaps met in broader meetings. There was every 6 months or once a year, at very rare intervals there was a meeting called a section meeting which purported to represent the entire membership of the Hollywood section in one gathering. Let's call it a yearly conclave. It may have been more frequent than that. I only have been able to recall one of those meetings 2328 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I attended. That was early in my Communist Party membership. A lot of the people there were unknown to me. I believe that what has happened is that many of the impressions I have carried away of people as having been Communist Party members are people whom I met later on at a social organization and knew to be because I had seen them there or heard them mentioned there. It could not be called a unit meeting. It was a closed party meeting. That could have been where I met Berkeley, because I have never been able to figure out at whose house it was, except a house on the hill with an open patio, and we sat outside in the open. I remember going over Berkeley's testimony. There was something in it that struck a responsive cord in my mind, and it may have been there that I first met him. It may have been his home, I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if any outside instructors came in to give lectures to the group you were assigned to?
Mr. KIBBEE. If you say instructors, I would have to say I don't recall it, but I believe it happened. Outside people, people not members of that group, not assigned to that group, did come through to give indoctrination talks. Do you mean in Hollywood or within the Hollywood section?
Mr. WHEELER. Well, both. 
Mr. KIBBEE. I have only the vaguest memory that such things did happen.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you put Jeff Kibre in that category ?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes, I would.
Mr. WHEELER. And Luke Hinman?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes, I would there too, because I never met with these men regularly. This was in the closed confines of the party meeting, and it was only occasionally. I met with Hinnman once and Kibre perhaps 2 or 3 times, although I don't know what it was he talked about or spoke of, except my impression is he was not a part of the motion-picture industry. There is one segment of that section meeting that I do carry away with me, that either Bright or Tasker-they were a writing team, and they are rather closely identified in my mind-spoke and gave a very long report, and were functionaries of some sort. I can say with reasonable certainty that they were never a part of my group or unit. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall seeing John Bright and Robert Tasker at a fraction meeting? 
Mr. KIBEE. No, at the section meeting, at the large broad meeting. That is almost the only thing that I can recall of that meeting, I think, because one of them made a very, very long report and it got very, very dull and hot sitting there. That is the thing that sticks in my mind.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall at whose homes the meetings were held?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes; I can remember some homes that I know I attended the meetings in. I think I mentioned the Schulberg home and the Waldo Salt home. At the Joe Bromberg home there was some sort of school going on there. Whether Bromberg taught or not, it is hard for me to recall. I attended classes in the Marxist political economy. I remember the book. I believe these took place at the Bromberg home. I don't COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2329 recall if they were exclusive to members of the party. I think it likely that they were. Also the Frank Tuttle home, although I never knew Mr. Tuttle at all at that time, and I know that he had been a cooperative witness. I did not know him. I remember the home mainly because it did have a private gymnasium, and it seemed to me to be the last word in luxury and a home devoted to many left-wing endeavors, and there were party members there. I did attend closed party meetings in that home. I know that. It seems to me that it was not unusual to have a unit meeting in the home of somebody who, technically speaking, had not been exposed to you as a member of the Communist Party in the sense that you asked the qustion, you know, "Did you see him at a party meeting?"-although you certainly assumed that if the home was made available that it was made available by a fellow Communist.
Mr. WHEELER. What caused your disillusionment with the Communist Party?
Mr. KIBBEE. Well, I don't want to take you over material that has been gone over so often. I can remember in my own case it even was involved more or less with the theory of the Communist Party and not outside working in organizations where activity would kind of keep you from thinking too deeply. Several of the contradictions that arose troubled me a great deal. The one that troubled me the most, and still does now-I still feel it keenly-were the Moscow trials going on in that period and the revelations in those trials. I mentioned Mr. Samuel Ornitz before and he is the man that I recall that gave very effective explanations above and beyond what you would read in the Communist Party press as to why these trials were justified and why the defendants in those trials were guilty, but one thing that bothered me was not whether they were guilty or not. I was willing to go along and say yes, they were, from the evidence adduced, but why they were guilty, I couldn't understand why in this utopia, which we were supposedly working toward, that men in very high places, as these men always were, would commit such heinous crimes in order to overthrow. It just didn't make sense to me and that was a very disturbing factor. The lack of democracy was within the party itself. The business of orders coming down from some place that you never could put your finger on was not an easy thing to adjust to and I didn't adjust to it. I have mentioned before the party's popularity as a very false sort of whistling in the dark, the constant repetition of the phrase in the party press that the American people will do this and the American people will do that, when my own private experience led me to believe that the American people were not sympathetic. Still another case I can remember specifically was the Scottsboro case, which was one of the causes at that time. I had no concrete knowledge of it, but I sensed that there was an ulterior motive in Communist support of this thing, which I was sympathetic to, and the Liebowitz angle in the Scottsboro cause upset me quite a bit. My memory may be faulty but, as I remember it, Samuel Liebowitz was retained to defend the Scottsboro boys and became involved in an altercation with the Communists or the Communist-sponsored com- 2330 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA mittee who were in defense of them, too, and they were able to push Liebowitz out, or something of that sort. I felt that the most effective thing that could have been done for the Scottsboro boys, if they could have been paroled, was not the Communists' chief concern, that their chief concern was to excite pro-Communist feeling among the American Negroes, and that sort of thing. I sensed that in many things. I remember John Steinbeck who wrote, I thought, a most effective novel about the agricultural workers in the San Joaquin Valley, or, take it a step further, that the man did more for them than anyone else. A motion picture was made of the very sorry situation that existed there. I recall that John Steinbeck was at odds with the Communist Party. I can't say just how. It was a question of hearing them attacked and the work deplored and too bad lie doesn't see the light, and so forth, and these things troubled me a good deal. Also, as I say, Mr. Wheeler, I had been an indifferent member. I had not attended regularly. I was not as active a Communist as I was expected to be, and these troubling matters pushed me out very very quickly. I stopped going to meetings for a long period of time, for a reasonable period of time, anyway. I attach my formal break to Mr. Lawson, because after that everything was shut off to me.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified that you knew John Howard Lawson as a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. In October 1949 when you signed the amicus curiae brief in behalf of John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo, do you recall the purpose, the motive in signing this?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes, I do. I think my immediate motive, my personal one, was a gimmick that that petition contained, which is still in my mind. It said at the top of it that the undersigned did not express sympathy with the plight of the doomed men, but wanted a Supreme Court decision in regard to this whole problem of testifying before the committee and so forth. I don't want to represent myself here as being or as having been a hell-for-leather anti-Communist when I left the party because I was nothing of the sort. I was anti-Communist and non-Communist from that time on. I certainly did not begin to develop a sense of indignation about the whole thing until after World War II, and well after it, perhaps when most of the rest of the population, I suppose, was doing the same thing. I did not have a sympathy for the Hollywood Ten. As a matter of fact, I had a number of arguments about the Hollywood Ten. I was opposed to the position. I was often accused of being opposed to it because it did harm as an ex-Communist. I thought my opposition was broader than that, and I still do, because as an exCommunist who might and who indeed now has been brought out by the committee, I was very interested in hearing any kind of official declaration in regard to the position of men testifying before a committee, and so forth, that could be gotten, and I believe that that was the rationale on which I signed that petition.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who asked you to sign it?
Mr. KIBBEE. No, sir; I do not. Those petitions were all over town at the time. I know I did not join the committee that was submitting the first amendment that I think sponsored that petition. At any rate, it was involved in the fight for the Hollywood Ten, because I COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2331 was not in favor of the position they had taken. I cannot leemeber who gave me that petition to sign, although I know a number of people who were sympathetic to that.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you meet Albert Maltz, a member of the Cominimst Party? et
Mr. KIBBEE. No. sir; I did not. I am sure of that. I think I Maltz socially or professionally. I recall only 1 or 2 very brief encounters with him.
Mr. WHEELER. You signed a petition to nominate him for office in the Screen Writers' (uild in 1949?
Mr. KBBEE. Yes, sir, I did, and I haven't been able to explain that to myself at all. There are several probabilities. I don't know Maltz. It might have been on the basis of some issue before the guild at that time in which the so-called progressive faction, which was certainly heavily infiltrated with the Communists, was taking a position on some salary raise or something with which I was sympathetic. I might have done it on that basis. I might have done it while I was drunk at some party, I am sorry to say. I just don't know how I came to sign it.
Mr. WHEELER. Would an ex-Colimuniist sign a petition such as the Maltz petition if the person who circulated the petition knew you to have been a member of the Communist Party at one time ?
Mr. KIBBEE. Today and in recent years, certainly not.
Mr. WHEELER. I mean during the period that this transpired.
Mr. KIBBEi. Would a member, ex-Commninist Party member sign it it a party member presented it to him? I think under certain circumstances he would; yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that be caused, perhaps, by fear of what the communist t Party itself might do to an ex-Communist?
Mr. KIBBEE. That is an element.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever possess any type of fear after you left the Communist Party?
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes; I did. It is an element. There are many, many Communists in Hollywood, as you know better than anyone else, and it is hard to know whether you are behaving sincerely or not. It was something that I fe!tcertainly in my subconscious fear of some sort of slanderous treatment at the hands of Communists. As I say, I did nothing to come out slugging against the Communists.
Mr. WHEELER. Was the Communist Party then in the practice of slandering members who turned against them?
Mr. KIBBEE. There is no question about that. Yes; they did. They did. It was always viewed with suspicion. It was never presumed that you acted on your own volition. It was assumed that you were lured away by the FBI. In my day the FBI was not regarded as anyone that would do that, but there were some very prominent people in the anti-Communist forces that might have thought so when you went after a job or something of that sort. I don't want to suggest that I was blackmailed into signing that petition, because I would have remembered that. That was not the case. You asked me if an element of that sort was in my mind, and certainly that element always stays with the ex-Communist. It always does. A Communist is a man who thinks dogmatically and he can't understand it and he has to find reasons for it. SI know that when I was a member you would hear it said in the unit-I can't remember any of the people, only the name Lynch, and 2332 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I don't know if it is a real name or not-but you would occasionally as a part of the unit business, a memo would come through saying, "Stay away from John Smith." That is a fictitious name. "He was an FBI agent, and he did it because he wanted to get a good job," and all sorts of things. You would hear that.
Mr. WHEELER. Doesn't that involve a person's civil rights?
Mr. KIBBEE. Of course, it involves his civil rights. It is a form of social blackmail, as I say. It is hard to put your finger on it. I don't think they ever have made it so obvious as to say, "Sign a petition." I don't think it was that important to them. It certainly has gone on. I know that.
Mr. WHEELER. Those who seemed to cry the loudest for civil rights seem to have abused them the most.
Mr. KIBBEE. I guess we all know that now.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first come to California ?
Mr. KIBBEE. My parents brought me here when I was 10 years old. It is my home.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you go to school here ? 
Mr. KIBBEE. Yes; in South Los Angeles. I graduated from the Fremont High School.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you had any other education?
Mr. KIBBEE. Just a year at Los Angeles Junior College.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been a writer since leaving Los Angeles Junior College ?
Mr. KIBBEE. I always thought I was. The world didn't realize it until about 1939. I was with Fred Allen back in New York.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you live in Los Angeles from the time you left Los Angeles Junior College until you went to New York?
Mr. KIBBEE. No; I did not. I went to work at KGFJ in Los Angeles in approximately 1932 as an announcer and advertising copyrighter. I was there approximately a year. I went to New York in about 1933 or 1934, and I believe I must have been there for about 2 years. I was unemployed there for all of 2 years except for very odd jobs. I place myself back in Los Angeles about 1936 or so. I had come back with a New York writer, ghost writer, who went to work at Twentieth Century, and shortly after I quit him because I wanted to strike out on my own. I was in New York about 2 years before the last time.
Mr. WHEELER. After you left the party you went to New York again?
Mr. KImBEE. Yes. After I left in 1939 I went to New York and started to work for Fred Allen about 1940.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you remain in New York?
Mr. KIBBEE. Remained in New York then until the outbreak of the war, and for a period thereafter. Shortly thereafter I got a release from Fred Allen. Then I went to New Jersey to take a Government course in flying. I had meanwhile become a private flyer. Then I took a course in Army flight instruction. Then I came back to California as a licensed commercial pilot and an employee of the Army as a civilian flight instructor. In late 1941 or early 1942, I worked a year and a half or perhaps 2 years, the best part of 2 years, as a civilian pilot for the Army, at Ontario, and later at Lancaster, and then was commissioned in the COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2333 Air Force directly, stationed at the Van Nuys Army Air Base for the duration of the war. I was discharged in October of 1945; discharged as a captain. I really went to work in the studios for the first time with the sale of an original story. I'm sorry. I better correct that. I worked in motion-picture studios before then very briefly for a few weeks, but really became a screen writer in that sense of the word by selling an original story to MGM in 1946. From then on I have resided here in California.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you reaffiliate with the Communist Party while in New York City?
Mr. KIBBEE. No, sir; I did not. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did anybody contact you and attempt to resolicit your membership?
Mr. KIBBEE. I have a feeling that it was done, but I simply cannot place it. I don't know that it was done in terms of a formal resolicitation of membership so much as it was to try to draw me back into that media, but it did not happen. I know that I knew Communists in New York. Let me say this: I know it to my own satisfaction that I never attended a Communist Party meeting in New York. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know how I could have, and I know that I was glad to be free of the thing when I left here. It could not have happened.
Mr. WHEELER. While a civilian employee of the United States Army, did you attend any meetings of the Communist Party ?
Mr. KIBBEE. Oh, no, sir. I was more than a civilian employee. I was an enlisted member of the Reserve, frozen in that position, and you are not called to active duty to return to the service by keeping your job as a civilian employee. If you resign, then you are immediately called to active duty in the walking Army.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you attend any Communist Party meetings at all after 1939?
Mr. KIBBEE. No; certainly not.
Mr. WHEELER. Your present occupation is that of a screen writer? 
Mr. KmBEE. Yes, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. IS there anything you want to add for the record?
Mr. KIBBEE. Well, I would like to say this, then, that it has been in the years since World War II that I have developed active hostility to communism and to the Communist Party, and since Korea my own view is that membership in the Communist Party is treasonable, and so are its own policies. It is hard for me to believe that the men I knew have developed to the point of consciously pursuing these policies today with full awareness of their disloyalty to their own country and paying allegiance to a foreign one about which they know very little. I know that at that time that was always implicit in Communist theory, great loyalty to the Soviet Union. I think you never faced it at that time. It has been hard for me to believe, now, that a tense situation exists between the two nations, that the ideology has taken such a hold that they are able, obviously, to place their loyalty with the Soviet Union. I do feel that they are being fanatically swept along in international Communist strategy even toward their own 2334 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA destruction. I think I felt that about the Hollywood Ten, which is one of the reasons I was opposed to their position. It may seem strange that men would destroy themselves that way, but it isn't so strange, I think, if you know Communist theory and follow it through to its logical conclusion. I think it was thinking about those logical conclusions that made it very uncomfortable for me back 15 years ago or so. I know that martyrdom is a favorite Communist weapon and always has been. I think it has been very clearly demonstrated in Korea. It las been very apparent to me in the newspaper accounts of the prisoner-of-war disorders where many men lose their lives apparently deliberately in order to cause excitement. My own current political views may be ascertained fully among a wide circle of anti-('oniiunist friends and professional associates in Hollywood, and I have recently been tendered and proudly accepted a renewal of my Air Force Reserve commission. The problem of signing petitions and supporting causes promoted by the Communist Party has always been a tricky one in Hollywood, and my record ovei the years will be found to be exceptionally good in that respect. I have striven to sign petitions only when the text is literally in accord with my own views, it being well nigh impossible to investigate and determine wlat organization is behind a proffered petition. Thus I was able to sign the original Eisenhower-crusadefor-freedom pledge at about the same time I was declining to sign the Stockholm Peace Petition. I am opposed to war, but a careful reading of the text of the latter document revealed it to be a partisan appeal for the outlawing only of the atom bonml, which at that time the United States had, and the Russians presumably hadn't. I check such contributions as I make against the Internal Revenue Department's list of bona fide charities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have never belonged to or supported any organization on the Attorney General's subversive list. My prewar years in New York radio did not bring my name into the very broad listings in Red Channels, and my postwar years in Hollywood have involved me in no activities that would have put my name into the equally broad listings of the California Tenney Committee reports. Well, I think in my own case the Committee on Un-American Activities has been a blessing, Mr. Wheeler. We have referred before to the element of fear that is in a man as an ex-Communist. He never really comes out as anti-Communist. He is afraid of how it may be interpreted. It is not very pleasant to be dragged out, but I am grateful to have had the opportunity to speak freely without coercion, without any pressure of any kind, and that I have had an opportunity to express an open feciln of anticomniunism and take the position as an anti-Communist without it being felt that I am trying to wriggle out of my own responsibility for ever having joined. I think the committee does serve the ex-Communist very well in that regard, and I feel that very strongly indeed. It gives them a chance to close a part of his life that he doesn't very much like to have laying dormant, although that is very difficult, especially with the memory problem, to go back that far it is very difficult to open it up That's it, roughly. I have received every consideration, certainly. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2335 I haven't been rushed or pressed into this. I have been given a great deal of time. I am particularly grateful for the recent consideration in regard to my wife, who was quite ill, and to whom a public appearance on my part would have caused quite a bad situation. I am glad that history has taken its turn and given me a chance to get out from under in that way.
Mr. WHEELER. Thank you very much for your most revealing statement, Mr. Kibbee. (Whereupon the interrogation of Roland William Kibbee was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-PART 6 TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, CoMMrrTEE ON UN-AMERICAN AoTIVTrIES, Hollywood, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT' An executive statement given at 3: 50 p. m., June 2, 1953, at room 1117, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. STATEMENT OF BABBETTE LANG
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state your full name, please ?
Mrs. LANG. Babbette Lang.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you born
Mrs. LANG. Chicago, Ill.
Mr. WHEELER. You are giving this statement voluntarily and of your own free will?
Mrs. LANG. I am.
Mr. WHEELER. And you are not under subpena; is that correct?
Mrs. LANG. Right.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your educational background?
Mrs. LANG. High-school graduate and about 2 years of college.
Mr. WHEELER. Where did you attend college ?
Mrs. LANG. Los Angeles City College.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your employment background ?
Mrs. LANG. Oh, I worked as a secretary in various incidental jobs until 1933, at which point I went to work at the Screen Writers' Guild for 3 years, and then I went to work for Dore Schary as secretary, and was with him for 5 years, and that's it.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been a member of the union in Hollywood ?
Mrs. LANG. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Lang, the committee has come into possession of information which discloses you were at one time a member of the Communist Party. Is that correct?
Mrs. LANG. It is.
Mr. WHEELER. And when did you first join the Communist Party?
Mrs. LANG. In 1942.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who recruited you ?
Mrs. LANG. Steve Morgan. 'Released by the full committee. 2337 2338 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. And for what reason did you join the Communist Party?
Mrs. LANG. Well, it was during the war, and I, along with many others at that time, was interested in furthering the war effort. It seemed in talking to many people and reading literature-and I attended a few classes here and there--world events classes, they were called; current events classes in which it was pointed out-actually, these were probably recruiting classes, though at the time I didn't realize it, but it just seemed like they were world events classes, and the shape of events was explained, it seems to me, very clearly and very well. I was very confused on many political issues at the time, and this seemed to give some cohesion and credibility to what was happening. I went to these current events classes several years before I ever thought of becoming a Communist. I think they were in about 1937 or 1938. Then when my husband and I ran into Steve Morgan and his wife, they talked to us a great deal along the same lines, and it seemed that the Communist Party at that time was in the forefront in furthering the progression of the war and antinazism and so on. It was kind of like belonging to a group whose aims I understood or thought I understood, and it was just one of those big emotional bursts of enthusiasm that seemed at the time very right to me.
Mr. WHEELER. You referred to the wife of Steve Morgan. Is that Ann Morgan?
Mrs. LANG. Yes; Ann Roth Morgan.
Mr. WHEELER. When you joined the Communist Party were you assigned to a unit or a branch?
Mrs. LANG. Well, not immediately. I was assigned to an indoctrination class.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did this class run ?
Mrs. LANG. About 12 or 13 weeks.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals attended these classes, do you recall?
Mrs. LANG. Oh, there were about 7 or 8 people, I guess.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructor was?
Mrs. LANG. Yes; Michael Wilson.
Mr. WHEELER. Michael Wilson, a screen writer ?
Mrs. LANG. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what subjects were discussed or taught?
Mrs. LANG. Oh, there were classes on dialectical materialism, different phases of Marxism, elementary phases, I guess, and the Jewish question, the Negro question, America's part in the war effort.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the other students were at the indoctrination class?
Mrs. LANG. Estelle and Carl Foreman. It is quite difficult to remember. I remember we met once at the home of Viola Brothers Shore. I met in her home once or twice. I don't believe I recall any of the other people in the class. There was a girl named Helen, but I never knew her last name. I never saw her after that.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you recall at whose other homes you met?
Mrs. LANG. We met at Michael Wilson's home. I believe we had them at my home once or twice, and at Viola Shore's. That's about all that I recall. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2339 
Mr. WIIEELER. After the completion of the indoctrination or beginner's class, were you then assigned to a unit?
Mrs. LANG. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. And what type of people belonged to this group?
Mrs. LANG. These were motion-picture people in the main. At first my husband and I-as I remember, we were in a group together, but for a very short tume, and then they were separated and wives were put in one group and the writers then were put in a special writers' group. The residue of mostly the wives then were put in what was called a neighborhood group. Actually, what it amounted to was principally writers' wives.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the members of the first group?
Mrs. LANG. Let's see. There was Sam Ornitz and his wife Sadie; George Willner and his wife Tiba; Guy Endore and his wife Henriette; and Carl and Estelle Foreman; and David and myself. Oh, yes, Charley Leonard and his then wife Helen.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this first unit?
Mrs. LANG. I don't remember exactly. It was a very short time. I don't remember the exact length of time. It seems to me it was just a period of weeks.
Mr. WHEELER. And you testified you were then transferred to a second unit; is that correct?
Mrs. LANG. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. And how long were you a member of the second group? 
Mrs. LANG. I was in that group for a couple of years, anyway, maybe longer. That group began as a very small group. As I remember, as I said, primarily the wives of the writers were put in special groups. Then it enlarged. We were told then that the party was coming more above ground and there was a lot of talk about showing the face of the party.
Mr. WHEELER. It became the Communist Political Association?
Mrs. LANG. Yes. And there was less secrecy about the whole thing, and then many people came in and out. I mean they were in for a couple of weeks. You never got to know them. You knew maybe their first name and then they were gone and other people came in and they were gone. There was a great influx during that period. There is a little confusion in my mind at this point because during this period it was decided that for purposes of recruitment a group would be set up, a discussion group, to just discuss theoretically world events, and I was put in charge of this group to organize it and lead it.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this after it became the Communist Political Association?
Mrs. LANG. I think so. That was during the period when there was a great deal less secrecy, when it allegedly was showing its face, as it is termed.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who were members of the second group?
Mrs. LANG. You mean of the discussion group? You just mean the second Communist group?
Mr. WHEELER. The second Communist group.
Mrs. LANO. Well, let's see. The people I mentioned first, the wives were all there; Henriette Endore and Estelle Foreman and Jean Lees, Margaret Maltz, Catherine Larkin. I don't know that she is 2340 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA married. She is Margaret Maltz' sister. I don't know that she is married. She wasn't then. Then there were many people whose first names I knew and never knew their last names. There was a man by the name of Ed.. There there for was another woman by the name of Catherine. They were short periods of time. Also, a girl named Estelle Saul, Oscar Saul's wife.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Clare Burnstein? can't reMrs. LANG. Yes. Clare Burnstein, I know her now. I or in the member too well whether she was in the discussion group party group. I think she was in both groups, as a matter of fact.
Mr. WHEELER. How about Russell William Burnstein?
Mrs. LANG. Yes; her husband. .
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know what his occupation was was in Burnstein-he
Mrs. LANG. No; I don't. I know that Rus some technical capacity, I think. He was either an engineer or something. He went to Europe, I know, with Lou Bunin and that whole group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was his wife, Clare, employed in the motion-picture industry ?
Mrs. LANG. As far as I know she was just housewife.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever learn that this particular branch was called Branch I of the Communist Party?
Mrs. LANG. I never knew that. As far as I knew we were called the Wilshire-Fairfax group. I never knew it by any other name.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, you mentioned that you helped organize a discussion group. Would you go into more detail in regard to this?
Mrs. LANG. As I said, the idea was for recruiting purposes, and in the beginning Jean Lees and I were supposed to organize this, and we met, and various other people in the club were to either bring or send friends to this group. We met the first time in Jean Lees' home, and as I remember, there were some, maybe 20 or 30 people, and then we met on Sunday nights, alternate Sunday nights, twice a month. The group would decide what they wanted to discuss, what they wanted to talk about, and then someone would volunteer to either give a report or lead the discussion. Actually, the Communist Party was never mentioned, as I recall, or if it was it was just in passing, and I am sure, I feel very convinced, that most of the people for the most part that came to the discussion group did not know it was organized or that it was Communist inspired. I think the idea was that they would just come in to discuss world events, and actually, as far as recruiting is concerned, to my knowledge there was very little or none. I know I never recruited anybody for that group. I don't know of anybody who was.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did this discussion group operate?
Mrs. LANG. Oh, I would say approximately a year.
Mr. WHEELER. And during this period of time were you also a member of the second group for the Communist Party? This was extracurricular work, was it not?
Mrs. LANG. Yes. This was my assignment, and also during that time I had another assignment which was to organize a blood donor's booth, which I did, and carried on that for many, many months. We had a blood booth on Wilshire Boulevard, and we all took turns taking COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA hours there in recruiting blood donors. 2341 So it all seemed a very worth- while furthering of the war effort.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the lecturers at these discussions?
Mrs. LANG. Actually, there were no lecturers. It was just as I said. The group would decide what they wanted to talk about, and then some person would just say, "Well, I'll look up and get some material on that subject," if it was the Negro question or the Jewish question or the Hitler-Stalin pact or whatever it was currently being talked about and thought about in the world. No one actually what you would call held the floor or gave any lectures. No; that isn't true. Occasionally we did have someone who would come and give a formal talk, such as I think at one time Albert Maltz came and led a discussion. There were a couple of writers who came in on different occasions. I can't remember who they were. I can't remember their names. I can visualize one of them very plainly but I just can't think of his name to save my life.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you leave the Communist Party ?
Mrs. LANG. In either 1945 or early 1946.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to another group during that period of time?
Mrs. LANG. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. For what reason were you transferred? Do you recall?
Mrs. LANG. Well, the groups were in a great state of flux at that point and they were breaking up. As I recall, the group was getting unwieldy, too large, and it was thought that it was better for people to be assigned more directly to their own neighborhood, and so I was transferred to another group which was my last group. From that group I left the party.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this group comprised of motion-picture people?
Mrs. LANG. For the most part* no.
Mr. WHEELER. Just a geographical group ?
Mrs. LANG. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members were in this group ?
Mrs. LANG. There was a girl by the name of Ruth Oser and a guy by the name of Harry Tanner. Now, some of these people I knew fairly well. Others I didn't know at all. I remember I used to laugh because it seemed to me every other person's name in the group was Ruth, most of whom I didn't know and had no desire to know, because by that time I was getting a little chilly, and my attendance at these meetings was very irregular. For the most part I was reluctant to take assignments and do jobs, and I was beginning to get resentful of the whole attitude of the party. Up to this point there was no dissension in the groups and it was pleasant and more or less social and no one made any great demands on you. You did what you could do and it was mostly on a volunteer basis, but in the last group there seemed to be what is termed a feeling of greater party discipline, and I began to resent it.
Mr. WHEELER. Would this be after the Duclos letter?
Mrs. LANG. Oh, yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your attitude with respect to the Duclos letter 2342 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. LANG. Well, I didn't take part in any of the discussions. It was mostly listening, and at the time I thought, "Gee, this is kind of a fast shuffle" we were being given, and it seemed to me as though there was a lot of directive from above. The business of the group-well, the whole idea that we were always being told, and I accepted it for a long time, as the autonomy of the group, and for a long time it seemed to operate very well. The group was a group of people who I considered were fairly independent thinkers and there seemed to be autonomy. In the last group it seemed like we were always getting directives, and all you had to do was open your mouth in disagreement and you were looked at quite with askance. There would be terms such as "renegade" and "deviant" and terms that I was just not able to accept. The Duclos thing I think I accepted, because the people who discussed it were very articulate and very convincing and it was just sort of a subtle shuffle that you almost weren't aware of. There was a vague feeling of maybe there should be more discussion. I never had a feeling of open resentment. I kind of accepted the Duclos letter.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the size of this group ?
Mrs. LANG. It wasn't a large group. I would say generally there probably weren't more than 10 or 12 people in attendance and not always the same ones?
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where they met?
Mrs. LANG. Yes. We met at Ruth Oser's home. We met a few times at my home. Oh, yes; there was another girl who also lived in my neighborhood, at whose home we met, by the name of Carufo. Jessie Carufo. I don't think she is even in town any more. Oh, yes, there was another girl by the name of Catherine Van de Kar. We met at her home up in the Hollywood Hills.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Miss Van de Kar's occupation?
Mrs. LANG. Nursery school director.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was the chairman of this third group?
Mrs. LANG. He was a man by the name of Milton. I don't know his last name. It was a long foreign name and I heard it maybe once or twice, but I never really knew.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he an elderly man ?
Mrs. LANG. No; he was in his late thirties, I would say.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the other officers of this group?
Mrs. LANG. Harry Tanner I think was an officer. I am not quite sure what. If I am not mistaken, he collected the dues. He wasn't called the treasurer. I forget what the person's name was-I mean what the person who collected the dues was called. Ruth Oser was some kind of an officer. I don't recall what she was, either. At one point I was educational director. I did a very bad job. I wasn't interested.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you purchase the Communist publications?
Mrs. LANG. No, sir; I was never literature director. I think in this group, as I remember, anybody who happened to get near the bookstore picked up the books. I don't think there was a definite person who did it all the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Why did you leave the Communist Party,
Mrs. Lang? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2343 
Mrs. LANG. Well, there was a great bit of disillusionment that started setting in with me over a long period of time. It was one of those things where I wasn't happy with the great feeling of secrecy. I wasn't happy with the kind of directives that you either accepted or else. There was so much it seemed to me there. There were so many demands made on the individual that whether or not you wanted to do whatever it was, it was expected of you, and there were no excuses acceptable. I don't know. It almost became what the-the whole feeling, to me, became what non-Communists feel about the Communist Party, which is a kind of a stereotype, very serious, militant feeling, and then I started hearing things. I started listening to people. All during these years actually I never once thought about, and as a matter of fact we were told that there was no connection between the Communist Party of the United States and the Russian Communist Party, and when I started thinking and started hearing that this was an international setup, I didn't like it. I didn't like the feeling that the American Communist Party might be taking directives from the Russian Communist Party. I didn't like the idea. There was hterature that we were practically forbidden to read.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the literature that you were forbidden to read?
Mrs. LANG. The main thing I remember, which I have been reading just recently, were the Arthur Koestler books, for instance, Darkness at Noon is one of them. Those were the main things that I remember. He was terribly frowned on. There is another very famous writer that we were told absolutely a good Communist does not read. Suddenly all these things started piling up. I just lost enthusiasm. I lost heart for the whole thing. I didn't like the dictation. I didn't like any part of it. I just felt washed up. Of course, it takes a long time to get out of the party. You don't just suddenly make up your mind one day and get out. There are all sorts of guilt feelings. There are feelings of fear of disapproval, not actually physical reprisal, but after long contact with certain kinds of people you have the fear of being cut off, almost cut off from the main stream. It becomes so much a part of your life for so long that for a very long time I wanted to get out before I actually had the nerve to do it. Then I took leave of absence. I made all sorts of excuses.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend any fraction meetings of the Communist Party
Mrs. LANG. I never had any occasion to because I never belonged to a guild or a union.
Mr. WHEELER. You never had the occasion to meet any of the secretaries in the motion-picture industry who were Communists?
Mrs. LANG. I was never at any fraction meetings of the-wait a minute. There were a couple of girls that were in my first group toward the end who were secretaries; one girl by the name of Eunice Mindlin.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Esther Jerry Wagner as being a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. LANG. Jerry Wagner I think came to the first group or the second group I was in, but only for a very short time; maybe a 2344 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA couple of meetings. She wasn't there regularly, or maybe it was right before I left.
Mr. WHEELER. I am not going to ask you the names of the individuals for the public record who attended your class which you organized. However, if you do recall any of the names of the individuals who attended this class, I would like to have them.
Mrs. LANG. You mean the discussion group?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mrs. LANG. That is a tough one. If I remember correctly, if she is the same person I think she is, it seems to me that Catherine Brant was a member of the discussion group, but I can't remember now whether she was a party member or not. I can't say for sure. It seems as though she was, but I'm not positive.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Catherine Brant's occupation?
Mrs. LANG. Housewife as far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you have anything you would like to add for the record ?
Mrs. LANG. No; I don't think so. As far as I am concerned, I am finished and washed up with the Communist Party. I want no part of it. I think that actually, psychologically, I have forgotten so much because I just wanted to push it out of my life. I would never think of rejoining the Communist Party. I think they are a menace, not in terms of overthrowing the Government, but just as a mild disruptive force.
Mr. WHEELER. You have deviated to the degree that you are nonacceptable, I think.
Mrs. LANG. I think I am really nonacceptable. I don't think they would want me. I don't think I would be suitable material at all. One thing I failed to mention that during the time that I was in the last group I was also a member of the IPP.' Actually it was an assignment and my naivete was so great that I never even knewand this I say shamefully-actually because I obviously was not a good Communist and was obviously painfully ignorant, but I never even knew that the IPP was a Communist organization. Now, you can believe that or not, but that is actually the truth.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you come to the conclusion that it is a Communist organization ?
Mrs. LANG. I know it now. I certainly didn't know it during the whole time I was a member of the IPP. I didn't even know what people were Communists. I venture to say that most of them were not. I attended a lot of IPP neighborhood meetings during the Henry Wallace period.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you think of anything else ?
Mrs. LANG. No; I can't think of anything. There was another man, now that I think about IPP, who worked in the IPP, whom 1 knew as a Communist, and I can't even remember his last name now. His first name was Morry.
Mr. WHEELER. Your statement will be very much appreciated by the committee, Mrs. Lang. Thank you very much. (Whereupon the interrogation of Babbette Lang was concluded.)

EXECUTIVE STATEMENT 1 An executive statement given at 4: 30 p. m., June 2, 1953, at room 1117, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. STATEMENT OF LEE J. COBB
Mr. WHEELER. State your name, please.
Mr. COBB. Lee J. Cobb.
Mr. WHEELER. When and where were you born, Mr. Cobb?
Mr. COBB. New York City, December 9, 1911.
Mr. WHEELER. Your educational background, just briefly.
Mr. COBB. Public schools and high school in New York City and CCNY at night.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you obtain any degrees from New York City College?
Mr. CoBB. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Your profession is that of an actor?
Mr. COBB. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. And how long have you been so employed?
Mr. COBB. Twenty-two years or so.
Mr. WHEELER. You have appeared both on the New York stage as well as in motion pictures ?
Mr. COBB. Yes; and radio and television.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Cobb, are you presently under subpena?
Mr. COBB. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you represented by an attorney?
Mr. COBB. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you desire counsel ?
Mr. CnBB. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. You realize by giving me this statement that it does not ehminate the possibility tllat in the future you may be called as a witness before the committee ?
Mr. COBB. I do; and I shall be happy to appear wherever and whenever the committee directs. SReleased by the full committee 2346 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Cobb, are you acquainted with Larry Parks?
Mr. COBB. Yes; I am.
Mr. WHEELER. I would hke to refer to his testimony in executive session on March 21, 1951. Mr. Parks testified that he was a member of the Communist Party in Hollywood and was being questioned by
Mr. Tavenner, counsel for the Committee on Un-American Activities, and was asked to identify individuals whom he had known to be members of the Communist Party. On page 11' of the testimony by Mr. Parks, lie stated that he knew Lee Cobb to be a Communist. Is that a correct statement?
Mr. COBB. Yes; that is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you join the Communist Party, Mr. Cobb?
Mr. COBB. I joined in 1941, I believe, 1940 or 1941.
Mr. WHEELER. In what city did you join?
Mr. COBB. In New York City.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the circumstances that led up to your becoming a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COBB. I do.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you relate them, please?
Mr. COBB. In the pursuit of my professional endeavors I became a member of the Group Theater in New York. As a member I made several friends, among them Phoebe Brand and Morris Carnovsky. It was at their invitation after an association professionally and in friendship of a few years that I attended a couple of meetings as a visitor and subsequently accepted the fact that I was a member. I put it that way because there didn't seem to be any formality involved such as the signing of a card or indoctrination of any other kind.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, Morris Carnovsky and Phoebe Brand, in all probability, did some kind of sales talk to promote the Communist arty so that you would become interested in it. What sold you on the Communist Party ?
Mr. COBB. As I recall, the atmosphere in the country as a whole at that time lent itself to rather a loose liberal, if not leftist, interpretation of events, local and international, and at that time we took each other for granted as subscribing generally to a similar interpretation of history. I was influenced greatly by their seniority within the group. I respected their opinions and, as I say, socially as friends we had known each other sufficiently long for me to accept an invitation of that kind.
Mr. WIHEELER. How long were you a member of the Communist Party in New York City ?
Mr. COBB. In New York City it was until the middle of or the beginning of 1942, at which time-I went to a small town called Tyrone, Pa., where I undertook a Government course in flight training to improve my qualifications to become a flight instructor.
Mr. WIIEELFR. How lllanly monliths would you say you were a member of the Communist Party in New York, approximately?
Mr. COIBn.To the best of my recollection, it lacked a year. I imagine it was in the vicinity of 8 or 10 months.
Mr. WiHEELER. How many meetings did you attend over that period of time? 1 See p 2303, tils publication. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2347 
Mr. (Con. I would say half a dozen.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who notified you of the meetings? The attendance was infrequent; therefore, I assume you would have to be notified.
Mr. Coun. I would say that invariably it was either Phoebe Brand or Morris Carnovsky, since they were the ones I knew most intimately.
Mr. WHXELER. Where wele the meetings held?
Mr. ('Cn. In a private house. At the Carnovsky's. I can't recall the names of several of the other people, although I have succeeded over the last week in isolating some of them visually, but I don't reenumber what their names were. 
Mr. WTIEELER. Do you recall who was chairman of the group?
Mr. ComB. No, sir. I am much more dependable with respect to recalling the names of the people in Hollywood than I seem to be with respect to the New York period, which is quite confused because I had been attending meetings in connection with Actors' Equity, as well as a caucus within Equity called the Forum, in addition to these party meetings. The Forum was a caucus within Equity, purportedly dedicated to liberal union issues, in which a Communist fraction played an important part.
Mr. WHIEELER. Well, how did you become aware of this fraction?
Mr. CBon. I heard references among Communsts to the fact that there were fraction meetings on Forum questions. Also, as a Communist I was instructed to support certain issues or vote in certain ways on the floor of Equity meetings whenever these issues arose.
Mr. WHuEELER. Did you ever attend a meeting of this fraction?
Mr. COBB. No, sir.
Mr. W EIELER. Do you recall any specific issues that you were instructed to vote in a certain way on?
Mr. CBB. No. Who was the actual
Mr. WHEELER. Who controlled the Forumi leader of the caucus?
Mr. COBB. Prominent in the Forum activities were, among others, Phil Loeb and Sam Jaffee, though I never knew them to be Communists. And I don't mean by mentioning their names to suggest that they were. But in answer to your question, they were very active in Forum, as well as Bob Reed.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay dues in New Yolk, do you recall?
Mr. COBB. In New York, I don't remember paying any dues in the Communist Party. Possibly I paid the nominal 25-cent minimum which was required. That, incidentally, goes for my dues paying on the west coast, too. I never paid any appreciable sum.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, do you recall any of the members of this group, other than Phoebe Brand and her husband Morris Carnovsky
Mr. CouB. On the occasion of my meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigation I tried to recall the names for that purpose as well and was successful. Since then I have recalled one more name, and that is the name of Pete Lyon, or Pete Lyons.
Mr .WHEELER. What was his occupation?
Mr. COBR.I believe lie was a radio writer. Also Bob Reed. I mentioned Bob Reed to the FBI.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Mr. Reed's occupation? 2348 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. COBB. He was an actor.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you please give your estimate of the number of people in this group in New York City of which you were a member
Mr. COBB. I would estimate about 10.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe you testified that in 1942 that you went to Pennsylvania to become a flight instructor; is that correct?
Mr. Conn. Yes. I took this CPTC course and completed it and got my instructor's rating and commercial license.
Mr. WIEELER. How long were you in Pennsylvania?
Mr. COBB. About 3 months.
Mr. WVHEELER. Did you have any contact or association with the Communist Party or members of the Communist Party while receiving this instruction?
Mr. COBB. No, sir; not at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. After you received your certificate for instructor, where did you move to then?
Mr. COBB. I went directly to Hollywood.
Mr. WHEELER. And approximately what date would this be?
Mr. COBB. Middle of August 1942.
Mr. WHEELER. When you arrived in Hollywood, did you reaffiliate with the Communist Party ?
Mr. COBB. It was after a number of months, quite a few months.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say as long as a year ?
Mr. COBB. Well, certainly 6 months.
Mr. WHEELER. That would bring it up to January or February of 1943.
Mr. COBB. That's right. I was contacted here by the party and advised that I was assigned to a local group and told to come to a meeting.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who contacted you?
Mr. COBB. I believe it was Gerry Schlein.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Mrs. Schlein's occupation ?
Mr. COBB. I don't think she had any professional occupation. She was a housewife, the wife of an artist by the name of Charles Schlein.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Charles Schlein as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COBB. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. I assume that his wife, contacting you, was a member?
Mr. COBB. Oh, yes; she was. We met at her home several times.
Mr. WHEELFR. Were you assigned to a group in Hollywood?
Mr. ConB. Yes. I don't know that the group was identified by any name or number, but virtually all of the people in it were.
Mr. WITEELER. How long lid you remain a member of the Communist Party in Hollywood?
Mr. COBB. With the exception of 2 years, during which I was in the Army, in the Air Force, I was with this group from the last date mentioned to sometime in 1946.
Mr. WHEELER. We established that you probably reaffiliated with the party in January or February of 1943. Now, can you tell us what date you entered the United States Army?
Mr. COBB. I entered the Armed Forces of the United States on September 7, 1943. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2349 
Mr. WHEELER. Well, then, in 1943 you were a member of the Com- munist Party for approximately 8 months. Do you recall how many individuals comprised this group you were assigned to'
Mr. COBB. Oh, a dozen, roughly.
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings did you attend ?
Mr. COBB. For the period before I went into the Army, must have been possibly 10 or 12.
Mr. WHEELER. How often did they meet ?
Mr. COBB. They met every 3 weeks, 2 or 3 weeks. It is evident that I was not regular in attendance. That accounts for the discrepancy in the number of times.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members of this group were ?
Mr. COBB. Yes; I do. To the best of my recollection, the members were Ann Revere, Gale Sondergaard, Dorothy Tree. Larry Parks, Marc Lawrence, Gerry Schlein, Lloyd Bridges, Shimen Ruskin, Rose Hobart, Jeff Corey, George Tyne, and Ludwig Donath. Several of these I had completely forgotten about until I was asked.
Mr. WHEELER. On how many occasions would you say you met Ludwig Donath as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COBB. His name is last on the list because he was the last one I recall, and I don't think I saw him more often than 3 or 4 times. It could have been because he was a member of the other group and I didn't see him until there was this unification. Elliott Sullivan is another one. Victor Killian, Sr., George Tyne, also known as Buddy Yarus.
Mr. WHEELER. During this 8-month period, the first time you were in the party here in Hollywood, did you pay dues?
Mr. COBB. From time to time-yes; I would pay the minimum. I frankly explained that when I was working I was making a sizable salary and I didn't think it was fair the weeks that I worked to pay such a large fee.
Mr. WHEELER. They had requested that you pay a percentage?
Mr. COBB. A percentage of salary.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what the percentage was?
Mr. COBB. No. I think there was a sliding scale if I am not mistaken, but I never did it, so I didn't know.
Mr. WHEELER. What would you estimate your dues amounted to over this 8-month period ?
Mr. COBB. Altogether?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. COBB. Certainly no more than $5 or $10. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the chairman of this group was or any other officers of this particular club?
Mr. COBB. I recall that Gerry Schlein was pretty much the driving force in the group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall whom you paid the dues to?
Mr. COBB. No. I believe that varied from time to time. The treasurer would be a different one.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the purpose of this group? What was the purpose of having a group of Communists comprised of actors?
Mr. COBB. Well, I don't know what their affirmed purpose was. I do know in effect it seemed to serve no practical purpose except the indoctrination and general orientation of actors. 2350 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Was it possible that an actor can portray in any way the Communist Party line through the method of acting? Can he get over a political line or thought ?
Mr. COBB. No. I don't think that was at all possible. However, a project was undertaken, led by John Howard Lawson, to rewrite the precepts of Stanislavski's method on acting, to try as far as possible to color it by the prevailing Communist ideologies. The project failed miserably because the moment we departed from the text as published by Stanislavski, we destroyed the most important aspect of it and consequently I resigned from the project.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was Stanislavski and what was his method of acting ?
Mr. Conn. Stanislavski was an actor and director in Russia before and since the revolution, who kept himself above all political questions of the time and dedicated his life to formulating an approach, a scientific approach, for the actor in his work, and for the first time broke down into scientific terms the elements involved in the creation of a role and thereby made possible a cogent practical attack for the actor.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you reached any conclusion in your own mind why John Howard Lawson wanted to change the writing of Stanislavski
Mr. ConB. The excuse was that however good Stanislavski was, he would be so much better if he were a Communist, and so the purpose was to add the Communist portion to Stanislavski which he was not endowed with by God.
Mr. WHEELER. Stanislavski's method of acting has been widely adopted in the United States by members of the acting profession ?
Mr. COBB. All over the world. It had a profound effect upon acting in general.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you state you were in the United States Army ?
Mr. COBB. Almost 2 years. I was discharged, honorably discharged, on August 24, 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your rank at that time ?
Mr. CoBB. Pfc.
Mr. WHEELER. Where did you serve in the United States Army? 
Mr. COBB. Mainly at Santa Ana with a radio-production unit.
Mr. WHEELER. While at Santa Ana, or, rather, while you were in the armed services, did you participate in any Communist meetings?
Mr. CoBB. No, sir. There was a strict directive in the party prohibiting that.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know for what reason ?
Mr. COBB. I can only suspect that since that was a period of relative harmony as between the Allies, it was thought best not to do anything that might upset that.
Mr. WHEELER. Well. after you returned, or, rather, after you were discharged, did you resume your membership in the Communist Party?
Mr. COBB. I waited until I was invited again, and attended some few additional meetings during which it became increasingly clear that since I and Mrs. Cobb, who. incidentally, has the same attendance record as my own in the party, that we were thorns in their sides and we didn't subscribe more and more to the requirements and the general pattern of acquiescence. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2351 
Mr. WHEELER. What pattern of acquiescence did you object to?
Mr. Conn. Well, a big point was made of adhering to a spirit of democratic centralism, and it was so obvious that the centralism obtained and the democracy was only given lip service to. True, we were invited to discuss things and to raise questions, but if after that we still were unconvinced, invariably you were to be pitied and perhaps given some extra talking to and lecturing and prevailing opinion as handed down was not to be questioned.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the Duclos letter?
Mr. COBB. I am generally familiar with it.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the time the Duclos letter was written?
Mr. ConB. I know of its existence. I never read the letter. I know generally what its purpose was.
Mr. WIIEEIER. Well, did it affect you in any way m your leaving the Communist Party?
Mr. COBB. It was shocking to me and it coincided with my general disenchantment with the party methods.
Mr. WHEELER. After you reaffiliated in 1945, were there any additional new members of this group? I am going on the assumption that you were reassigned back to the actors' group.
Mr. COBB. If there were, they were included in the general list of people.
Mr. WHEELER. You have identified all the individuals you met as Communists in Hollywood?
Mr. COBB. That's right.
Mr. WHEELER. Did any outside instructors come in to give lectures?
Mr. COBB. Yes; lectures and classes of a sort were held by Arnold Manoff.
Mr. WHEELER. He is a screen writer ?
Mr. COBB. He is a screen writer, and on one occasion a functionary, whose name I never got, had a private talk with me in an attempt to congenially pull me back into line. I can only describe him. I don't know his name. He was a man of more than average height. He had dark hair that was straight. He spoke with a German accent.
Mr. WHEELER. When do you date the time you completely left the party, or, rather, you quit attending meetings?
Mr. COBB. In an endeavor to be completely certain, I was going to say 1947, but in discussing it with Mrs. Cobb, she was convinced that it must have been 1946, sometime in 1946.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you say the first quarter or the second quarter or the third quarter? What would your estimate be?
Mr. COBB. Well, to avoid error, I would rather be on the long side than the short side, so I would say perhaps even as late as the third or fourth quarter.
Mr. WHEELER. We could estimate your membership after you returned from the Army a period of about a year. That could vary one way or the other?
Mr. COBB. That's right, a month or two.
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings would you say you attended?
Mr. COBB. Very few.
Mr. WHEELER. During that period.
Mr. CoBB. Very few. My ability to attend was circumscribed because I was sent on location on 1 or 2 occasions to Mexico. 2352 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. At that time you were under contract with Twentieth Century-Fox ?
Mr. COBB. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Their records would show the period of time you were on location ?
Mr. COBB. Yes. That is true. I have some of the dates.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you estimate the months that you were away?
Mr. COBB. Yes; I could. I was about 3 months in Mexico, about 5 weeks in Connecticut, and New York.
Mr. WHEELER. Any place else? I can
Mr. CoBB. I was on location in Cincago in 1946 or 1947. estimate that the time I was away from Hollywood during my latter membership was about 5 months.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions to ask you about the period of time you were a Communist. I would like to ask you if you think we have covered most of the information you possess. 
Mr. COBB. I think so, and I want to make myself clear as being available should any further questions be necessary. If I should recall anything further that would be pertinent, may I amend?
Mr. WHEELER. Certainly. Upon receipt of a letter, we can amend the testimony, with the permission of the chairman. Were you a member of the Progressive Citizens of America ?
Mr. COBB. Is that the same organization that became ASP?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes; it is.
Mr. COBB. At one time I paid a dollar and got on the mailing list of ASP. If that makes me a member, I was.
Mr. WHEELER. It is noted here that a conference on thought control, sponsored by the Hollywood Arts and Sciences and Professions Council, Progressive Citizens of America, was held in the Beverly Hills Hotel. This information indicates that you were a sponsor of the thought-control conference; is that correct ?
Mr. COBB. I was a speaker.
Mr. WHEELER. You were a speaker?
Mr. COBB. I was invited to speak at this panel and when I demurred on the grounds that I was a poor speaker and hardly an authority, it was suggested that ASP would have the speech written for me, and when I examined the roster of what seemed to be respectable speakers from the university et cetera, I agreed to give this talk if the speech satisfied me.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember the topic of the speech?
Mr. COBB. It had to do with the historical role of the actor.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know who wrote it? 
Mr. COBB. No; I don't. It came unsigned.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there any political content in it to your knowledge? Or communistic content?
Mr. COBB. It was not conmunistic. It was liberal in tone and had no special pertinence to the present. It was mildly erudite and contained a lot of anecdotal information.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you believe that the United States Government and committees of Congress have the right-I am not speaking of the rights as set up by the laws of the United States, but the right to investigate Communists within any environment in the United States? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2353 
Mr. COBB. Yes, sir; I do. I believe a reasonable interpretation of the laws and the Constitution would disclose not only a right but a duty on the part of the various agencies of the Government so to do.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you believe that the Committee on Un-American Activities so-called set up a censorship of scripts in the motion-picture industry or of the products to be released by the motion-picture industry?
Mr. COBB. No, sir; I have seen no instance of it.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, the program of the American Peace Mobilization discloses that you signed a call to the American People's meeting to be held in New York City on April 5 and 6, 1941. 1 assume this was during a period of time when or about the period of time you joined the Communist Party.
Mr. CoBB. That's right. It must have been around that time.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember signing such a thing ?
Mr. CoBB. No. I wouldn't deny it, but I don't specifically recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with an organization known as the International Labor Defense?
Mr. COBB. I have heard of it.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, the Daily Worker of March 5, 1942, page 8, reports that Lee J. Cobb is going to be an auctioneer in the selling of books for this organization.
Mr. COBB. March 1942?
Mr. WHEELER. March 5. 
Mr. COBB. I don't recall anything in that connection. I am strongly inclined to say that I don't remember ever being an auctioneer for anything.
Mr. WHEELER. That would be a unique experience if you had been an auctioneer, and if so, you would recall it, wouldn't you?
Mr. COBB. I would recall it. There is no doubt that at that time I permitted myself to be identified with organizations, that is, with themes of that kind.
Mr. WHEELER. I notice from activities concerning the League of American Writers that they also had an auction and you were reported as the auctioneer and the reference is given as the Daily Worker, March 5, 1942, page 8. There must be a mistake made by whoever compiled it?
Mr. CoBB. That would be the same thing: wouldn't it?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. So it would either be the International Labor Defense or the League of American Writers, I would assume.
Mr. COBB. In either case, I must say that it is possible that I was tapped on the shoulder to do something like that. But, in all honesty, I don't recall the specific instance.
Mr. WHEELER. The Daily Worker of October 19, 1948, page 7, in an article, reports that you signed a statement in support of Henry Wallace, to which I certainly don't take exception. However, this was sponsored by the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions.
Mr. COBB. I probably did sign it.
Mr. WHEELER. You don't recall the background of who asked you?
Mr. COBB. I think there was a banquet which I attended.
Mr. WHEELER. For Henry Wallace? 2354 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. COBB. I think it was for Henry Wallace. As I recall, it was quite an extensive affair. I think it was at Ciro's. A good representation of Hollywood society was there.
Mr. WHEELER. The Daily Worker of March 8, 1949, page 13, shows you as a sponsor of a Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace to be held on March 25 to 27,1949. The article reports that you were also on the conference program. Do you recall anything about this particular item?
Mr. COBB. I recall specifically signing the petition. I was never asked nor did I appear on any program in that connection. The occasion was a young high-school boy and girl coming backstage to the dressingroom of the theater where I was then playing in New York City with the petition, acquainting me with the fact that it was a plea for peace, and I could see that quite a few prominent world figures had already signed, and I must say that I am most receptive where any efforts for the cause of world peace are concerned, and so I signed. I didn't look any further for any hidden political implications in this.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of Actors' Lab?
Mr. COBB. NO; I was not a member of the lab. I worked with the lab and I taught one term.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you receive compensation ?
Mr. COBB. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. I just wondered, because the school was approved by the United States Government for GIMr. ConB. That was much later. When I taught at the lab it was, I believe, before I went into the service.
Mr. WHEELER. To what degree did the Communist Party control the Actors' Lab?
Mr. CoBB. To the degree that there were several Communists on the board of the lab. Incidentally, I declined when I was invited to become a board member because of my ideas about the theater which were in variance with theirs. Their intention was to make the lab a mass people's organization, which obviously would have made impossible any real theater activity, and since I was interested in the theater, I did not lend myself to the attempt.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Communist fraction in the lab in any way control the product of Actors' Lab?
Mr. COBB. They influenced it insofar as they could influence other members on the board. I don't know whether numerically they were in the majority on the board, and of course I have no way of knowing to what extent they could have been an influence through personal association with the students and other people in the lab.
Mr. WHEELER. I note here by the Daily Worker of February 23, 1948, page 16, the Actors' Lab evidently formulated some type of protest against censorship. I note from this article or from the dossier that you were a supporter of this program. Do you recall any of the background of how you became a supporter?
Mr. ConB. That was directed at the committee investigation, was it?
Mr. WHEELER. I would go on that assumption, Mr. Cobb. Unfortunately, I don't have the article here.
Mr. COBB. Did you say I signed something?
Mr. WHEELER. It says you supported the Actors' Lab and protested against censorship. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 2355 
Mr. COBB. That may have been in connection with attacks on the lab by the Tenney committee in California, which in all honesty I had considered as unfair. I think it must have been that.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the People's Drama ?
Mr. COBB. No. sir. 
Mr. WHEELER. The Daily Worker of August 22, 1949, page 11, reflects that you signed a call for a meeting. This was sponsored by the People's Drama.
Mr. COBB. I perhaps did, but I still know nothing of the People's Drama.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, the Daily Worker of September 2,1949, page 4, discloses that you signed a statement on behalf of Robeson, I imagine the Paul Robeson meeting.
Mr. COBB. That was in 1949. I recall the time and I recall that I deplored very deeply the physical violence that flared up then. What did it say I signed?
Mr. WHEELER. On behalf of the Robeson meeting.
Mr. COBB. It is my firm belief that any individual, whether I subscribe to his beliefs or not, does have the right to express himself publicly so long as he does not by so doing endanger the safety and rights of others.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with an organization called China Welfare Appeals, Inc. ?
Mr. COBB. I am once again familiar with it. I say "once again," because recently I took the trouble to trace my past connection with it, which I had completely forgotten about. An organization which I believe was called the China Relief Ship in 1949, I think, asked for names for sponsorship in the theater. Richard Watts, Jr., the New York drama critic, approached me in this connection and I said he might use my name. I had completely forgotten about it. When it was called to my attention a couple of years later that another organization called China Relief, I believe, occupying the same address as the former, was then using my name on its letterhead in connection with its political activityMr. WHEELER. The latter was undoubtedly the successor organization; I mean they changed names, so frequently they changed names.
Mr. COBB. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. However, this was prior to the Korean police action, and what would your attitude be now in regard toMr. COBB. Well, in line with my attitude now as well as last year, ] last year sent them a registered letter insisting that they cease using my name in any way for their efforts, and that would still be my attitude today, of course. You did mention the Korean conflict. May I say now in that connection that in 1951 I offered my services to the Korean Consulate General in New York. I offered my services in behalf of South Korea to their Consulate General in New'York in 1951 to be made use of in whatever way they might, in answer to which I received a very kind letter from David Y. Namkoom, the Consulate General. The letter is dated November 16, 1951. Also may I say for the record that I have letters and commendations from the Treasury Department dated October 31, 1949, for my participation in transcribed radio programs. 2356 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I also was happy to.make several Navy recruiting programs in 1950 or 1951, and two big United Nations radio programs in 1949 and 1950J I have participated prominently in several other programs on radio and film in connection with our Government's efforts at home and abroad in the furtherance of the cause of. democracy as expressed by our current foreign policy.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Cobb, do you have anything further you would like to add for the record ?
Mr. COBB. I would like to thank you for the privilege of setting the record straight, not only for whatever subjective relief it affords me, but if belatedly this information can be of any value in the further strengthening of our Government and its efforts at home as well as abroad, it will serve in some small way to mitigate against whatever feeling of guilt I might have for having waited this long. I did hope that in my delay to speak earlier others of the people I had mentioned might have availed themselves of this opportunity for themselves to do likewise. I think by this time I can reasonably assume that those who have desired to do so have taken the opportunity to make their position clear, and I can only say that I am sorry for those who haven't and that more haven't done so.
Mr. WHEELER. Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb, for giving the committee the benefit of your knowledge of the Communist conspiracy. (Whereupon the Interrogation of Lee J. Cobb was concluded.) INDEX Page Adams, Charlotte Darling---____ -------2309-2320 (statement) Alien, Fred __-----___ __.-------- ------------------- 2332 - 2325 _------- -----------Anderson, Betty (Mrs. Betty Wilson) 2317 ____--Bachelis, Thelma -2305 ------------Backus, Georgia__ 2325 -------------------Bassman, George --------2318 Beard, Cecil -----------------------------2326-2328 Berkeley, Martin....-------------------.2317 -----------------.
