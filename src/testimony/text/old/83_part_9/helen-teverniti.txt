Mrs. TEVERNITI. Helen Teverniti.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell your last name, please?
Mrs. TEVERnTI. T-e-v-e-r-n-i-t-i.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is noted that you are accompanied by the same counsel who appeared with the previous witness. Where do you reside?
Mrs. TEERNT. Seattle, Wash.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were you born ?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. Red Oak, Iowa.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in Seattle ?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. 32 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation?
Mrs. TEVERNrr. I am a housewife and also a musician.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged, commercially, in the musical profession in Seattle?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. It has been very casual. I would say 15 years. (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. I attended public schools right on through high school, had 1 year at the University of Washington, 1938, and had private training on my instrument, the piano, from the time I was 41/2 on. I think that covers it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you on the faculty of the Pacific Northwest Labor School in the spring of 1947?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. I believe that is an organization that has been cited as a Communist-front organization. I shall certainly plead my privilege under the first and fifth amendments in refusing to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. You recall that Mrs. Barbara Hartle gave testimony to the committee regarding that school; do you not?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. I believe that was the case.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it true that Mrs. Hartle was the No. 2 person in the Communist Party in the area of Seattle at the time she was prosecuted as one of those indicted under the Smith Act in Seattle in 1953 or 1954? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. TEVERNITI. I should certainly think I should refuse to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERE. What counsel says is true. So let's go on.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Hartle testified in the course of that hearing in Seattle that she knew you as a member of one of the professional branches of the north King County area of the Communist Party and connected with cultural work of the Communist Party. Was her testimony, insofar as it related to you, truthful?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. It is obvious that I will refuse to answer that question and any similar questions on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you decline to answer ? It may be obvious, but I think we should have it a little more specific. 3870 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
Mrs. TEVERNITI. Yes, I certainly do decline.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you engage in any Communist Party teachings in any field, whether music or otherwise, while living in Seattle?
Mrs. TEVENITI. I am sure that this would come under the same category of questions, and I refuse to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TEVERNITI. I refuse to answer that question also on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. The next witness, please.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Elias.
Mr. MOULDER. Will you be sworn, please? Do you solemnly swear the testimony which you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. ELIAs. I do, sir. TESTIMONY OF LEWIS 3. ELIAS
