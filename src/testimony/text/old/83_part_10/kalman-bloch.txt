Mr. BLooC. Kalman Bloch.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel accompanying Mr. Bloch please identify herself for the record ?
Mrs. ROSENBERG. Rose S. Rosenberg, b-e-r-g. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell both your first and last names, Mr. Bloch?
Mr. BLOCH. K-a-l-m-a-n B-1-o-c-h.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born?
Mr. BLOCH. 1913 in New York.
Mr. TAVENNEE. Where do you now reside? 
Mr. BLOCH. Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been a resident of Los Angeles?
Mr. BLOCH. Since 1937.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession? 
Mr. BLOCH. I am a musician.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you practiced your profession since 1937 in the area of,Los Angeles? 3956 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. BLOCn. Yes. I have been solo clarinetist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic since then.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what-your formal educational training has been.
Mr. BLOCH. Yes, sir, I will. I studied in the New York City elementary schools. I attended NYU for 3 years and with more supplementary education at Columbia and UCLA. I received a scholarship grant from the New York Philharmonic which enabled me to study clarinet with the solo clarinetist there, who was the outstanding man in his field. I played for 4 years in the International Orchestra of New York. I teach extensively, and was one of the first to institute the free scholarship idea in the Los Angeles school system. I do frequent solo and chamber music performance with leading chamber music groups, and have appeared frequently as soloist with the Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl Orchestras. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. Oh, I said this previously but I think it goes in order now. I have been for 19 years a solo clarinetist of the Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl Orchestras.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Bloch, will you state whether or not you have any personal knowledge of an effort made by the Communist Party in Los Angeles to induce musicians who were members of the Communist Party to circulate petitions in 1948 of the Independent Progressive Party of California to place that party on the ballot ?
Mr. BLOCH. I must decline to answer that question on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a document marked for identification as "Kalman Bloch Exhibit No. 1." It is a photostatic copy of an Independent Progressive Party ot California petition, at the end of which there is an affidavit of a person by the name of Kalman Bloch as the affiant. I ask you to examine it and to state whether or not that is your name as the affiant, and whether or not you signed the name. (Document handed to the witness and his counsel.)
Mr. BLOcH. I must decline to answer this question on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document in evidence, marked "Kalman Bloch Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. MOULDER. The document so marked by counsel is admitted in evidence. (See p. 3957.)
Mr. BLOCH. IS it not a possibility, within my rights as a citizen, to petition at any time?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, you have a perfect right to do that. My question was whether or not you knew of the existence of a Communist Party plan to cause you to do it.
Mr. BLOCH. I am sorry. I refer to my previous answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would be very happy if you would explain it.
Mr. BLooi. I still must refer to the previous answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, the document bears the date February 6, 1948, and, the affidavit, as in the other exhibits, recites that the affiant circulated and obtained the signatures in the document. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3957 KALMAN BLOCH EXHIBIT No. I INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY OF CALIFRNIA PETITION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION JUNE 1, 1948 T Wtsy CRiyd C..t-ti., Cirooli tois-iS. aQ' STATEOFCALIFORNIIA.

Mr. BLOCH. I should like to say that this question, I think, implies that I am disloyal and not a trustworthy citizen. I would like to tell you about my long career as first clarinetist of the Philharmonic Orchestra. Not only my musicianship but my moral and ethical conduct, my loyalty, my feeling of cooperation in the group, my devotion not only to the music but to my colleagues were quite open for their appraisal, and I am sure that each colleague of mine would bear me out, would vouch for me in this, that I am a man, that I have always been devoted to music, I abhor violence and never in my life have I done anything I am ashamed of. I feel that the question is a dangerous one for me to answer. So I must rely on the fifth amendment which protects me against any prosecution.
Mr. MOULDER. You decline to answer, and, as your reason for declining to answer, you claim the privilege under the fifth amendment. Is that right? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. Another really essentialMr. MOULDER. You did not answer. As I understand, you decline to answer the question propounded by claiming your protection provided by the filth amendment.
Mr. BLOCH. Yes. May I take 1 minute to further complete the answer.
Mr. JACKSON. I am not quite clear. You have declined to answer on that ground. Is that correct?
Mr. BLOCH. I have declined.
Mrs. ROSENBERG. May he be permitted to complete his answer? He says he has not yet completed.
Mr. MOULDER. Hasn't he claimed the privilege ?
Mrs. ROSENBERG. He has not completed his answer. May he do so, and give his grounds?
Mr. MOULDER. As I understand, the witness has claimed the privilege under the fifth amendment. That just about settles it. He declines to answer the question.
Mrs. ROSENBERG. It may settle it, if I may say so, in your mind. The witness would like to complete that answer.
Mr. JACKSON. The regular order. The witness claimed the provisions of the fifth amendment, and also preceded it by considerable remarks. And I think that he was given every opportunity to put his point across before taking the amendment. I would ask for regular order. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a document marked "Kalman Bloch Exhibit No. 2" for identification only. It is a photostatic copy of an affidavit of registration bearing date the 22d day of April 1948, of a person whose name appears to be Kalman Bloch, showing an intention to affiliate with the Independent Progressive Party. Will you examine it, please, and state whether the COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3959 name appearing there is the name of Kalman Bloch and whether it is your signature ?
Mr. BLOCH. Don't you feel I have the right to join any legal party like the Progressive Party ? (Document handed to the witness.)
Mr. TAVENNER. If it is your contention or your position that your action in that respect had nothing to do with the Communist Party plan which has been described in this hearing, why, of course, I assume that you would say so. Certainly there would be nothing wrong about it. Many other people did. But we are trying to find out the connection of the Communist Party with this. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. I am sorry. I must refuse to answer on the basis of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document in evidence, marked "Kalman Bloch Exhibit No. 2."
Mr. MOULDER. The document so marked by counsel is admitted in evidence. (See p. 3960.)
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, as long as the witness has asked that question of counsel-whether or not he did not have the right to join the Independent Progressive Party, which became a legal party-I want the record to show at this point that I am sure I recognize the right of any American citizen to be a member of any legal political party. But in this situation there should be a differentiation because we are investigating, Mr. Bloch, the extent to which the Communist Party of California secretly, underground by a preconceived program, had its members circulate these petitions without revealing to the people whom they asked to sign the fact that it was the Communist Party subversively doing it, to create indirectly at least a branch of the Communist Party program. I want you, as a fellow citizen, to understand that that is the reason in my book that you are being asked that question, because the evidence clearly shows not only in this hearing but in other California hearings by former top leaders of the IPP in California, by top officers, that they were deliberately put in by tha Communist Party action of California. And. since the Communist Party has been outlawed, as defined by Congress and the courts, as a conspiracy, we certainly have the duty to go into the extent to which this conspiracy filtered into the political situation in California, the same as it did in many othersMr. MOULDER. Let's have order, please. Anyone responsible for the demonstration should be removed from the hearing room, if the officers can properly identify the persons so responsible.
Mr. DOYLE. Including the Musicians Congress in Los Angeles, which, under oath again, was defined as a Communist Party means of trying to take control of the musicians branch in Los Angeles.
Mr. BLOCn. Counsel, is there a question pending?
Mr. MOULDER. May I ask you this question: Much has been said-and we have heard the testimony and considerable evidence regarding Communist Party control and domination over the Independent Progressive Party. 77486--56-pt 10-5 8960 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA KALMAN BLOCH EXHIBIT sIIATeMeN RANSFERON CHANGEOF N oF Stneet eNe. the herby authorize *zIS ORIGINAL I NO.

(The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLocH. I refuse to answer, claiming the first and fifth.
Mr. MOUmLER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist Party at this time?
Mr. BLOCH. I am going to answer that question. However, I feel that such a question, that inquires into one's political and religious beliefs, is an infringement on my right as a loyal American citizen.
Mr. MOULDER. Of course, we are not inquiring into your religious beliefs, Mr. Bloch.
Mr. BLOCH. No. All right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Or your political beliefs either.
Mr. JACKSON. Nor your political beliefs either.
Mrs. ROSENBERG. May this witness be permitted to answer that question?
Mr. MOULDER. Yes; the witness may proceed to answer the question.
Mr. BLOCH. Also, in view of my long-standing association with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and especially on the eve of their good-will tour to the Orient, could it not have come about that these questions be asked me in private? Why such an open forum? So that the philharmonic could receive unnecessary criticism?
Mr. JACKSON. The philharmonic is receiving no criticism. No one has suggested a single word of criticism.
Mr. BLOCH. I didn't mean to use the word "criticism." I am sorry. I meant publicity.
Mr. JACKSON. Very well. I don't know that the philharmonic orchestra has received any unfavorable publicity. The fact that there may have been in the orchestra several individuals previously identified as members of the Communist Party, under oath by witnesses, in no way reflects upon the philharmonic orchestra. Nor could the board of directors have been expected to have known the presence of members of the Communist Party in the philharmonic. The effort to bring the philharmonic into this is crystal clear as an effort to confuse the situation.
Mr. BLOCH. I am not trying to confuse the situation. I feel this, that the symphony being a community organizationMr. SCHERER. Wait a minute. Regular order.
Mrs. ROSENBERG. Mr. Chairman, the witness said he wanted to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. Let's have order. Please let us have order. The gracious lady knows the rules of the committee. Is there a question pending, Mr. Tavenner
Mr. TAVENNER. He has answered the last question I asked him.
Mrs. ROSENBERG. He has not answered the last question, Mr. Chairman. May I request, on behalf of my client, that he be permitted to answer the question? It is a simple request to make. You asked him to come here and talk, and he would like to. 3962 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. JACKSON. In accordance with the rules of the committee, I would ask that on the occasion of the next remark by counsel directed to any member of the committee or counsel, she be requested to leave the room with her client, if necessary.
Mr. BLOCII. I will just take 10 seconds and give you a satisfactory answer to this question. I felt strongly about the publicity that may have been given to the philharmonic.
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, I want regular order. The question is, Is he a member of the Communist Party now? He can answer that or take the fifth amendment.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mr. BLOCH. I feel strongly about my reputation in the philharmonic.
Mr. SCHERER. We agree that it is, as you state, a very fine reputation. You can help it by answering the question.
Mrs. ROSENBERG. May he be permitted to do so?
Mr. MOULDER. The question is whether or not the witness is now a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. BLOCH. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is the question.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed and move along.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you made application to the State Department for a passport to travel in a foreign country
Mr. BLOCH. Yes, I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you make that application?
Mr. BLOCH. With the entire philharmonic group about 2 months ago.
Mr. TAVENNER. About 2 months ago? Were you a member of the Communist Party at that time?
Mr. BLOCH. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was the passport issued to you?
Mr. BLOCH. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you still have it?
Mr. BLOCH. Yes.
Mr. SCHERER. How long before you made the application did you cease to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. BLOCH. A false assumption. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCHERER. Were you a member of the Communist Party the day before you made the application? You said you were not a member of the Communist Party on the day you made application for passport, because in that passport the question is asked whether or not you are a member of the Communist Party, and I assume that you answered that question "No." I am asking whether or not you were a member of the Communist Party the day before you made the application?
Mr. BLOCI. No.
Mr. SCHERER. Were you a member of the Communist Party a month before you made the application ?
Mr. BLOCH. No.
Mr. SCHERER. A year before?
Mr. BLOCH. No.
Mr. SCHRERE. Two years before? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3963 
Mr. BLOCH. Restate your question.
Mr. SCHERER. Were you a member of the Communist Party 2 years prior to making your application for passport?
Mr. BLOCH. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it 3 years before?
Mr. BLOCH. Excuse me. May I consult with counsel?
Mr. SCHERER. Certainly. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLoCH. Would you make your question specific?
Mr. SCHERER. Yes. Were you a member of the Communist Party 3 years before you made application for the recent passport which we have been discussing? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. No.
Mr. SCHERER. Were you 4 years before that a member of the Communist Party ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCHERER. I have no further questions.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you advise the State Department that you had been a member of the Communist Party when you applied for passport?
Mr. BLOCH. Fals-(The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. The State Department never asked me. Strike that. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BLOCH. I claim the firstI decline to answer on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCHERER. The fact is that you were asked, in making the application for passport, whether you had ever been a member of the Communist Party or not?
Mrs. ROSENBERG. Are you on the witness stand, Mr. Scherer? He was not asked that question.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, I ask that counsel be asked to leave the stand.
Mr. BLOCH. I think I need her support. Could I request that she remain ?
Mr. JACKsoN. I have given due notice what I intended to do. There have been altogether too many outbreaks from counsel.
Mr. BLOCH. I will answer more directly in the future. Could she remain ?
Mr. JACKSON. I am going to press my position.
Mr. MOULDER. As I understand it, the gentleman from California,
Mr. Jackson, moves that counselAnd witness?
Mr. JACKSON. And the witness as far as I am concerned. He is an uncooperative witness.
Mr. MOULDER. Be excused and removed from the witness stand.
Mr. JACKSON. Excused from the witness stand. I won't ask removal. 3964 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA I ask that they be excused.
Mr. MOULDER. Do I hear objection from any member of the committee? (There was no response.)
Mr. MOULDER. Therefore, the witness and counsel areMr. BLOCH. Mr. Moulder, I really take exception to Mr. Jackson's remark that I am uncooperative.
Mr. JACKSON. You may take exception to my remark that you are uncooperative. I consider you to be completely uncooperative.
Mr. MOULDER. Witness and counsel are excused from the witness stand for failure to abide by the committee rules in their conduct before the committee. Call your next witness, please, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Jack Pepper.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you solemnly swear the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
