Mr. KIMPLE. William Ward Kimple, K-i-m-p-1-e.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Kimple, have you ever been employed in an official capacity by the city of Los Angeles?
Mr. KIMPLE. I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your employment?
Mr. KIMPLE. Los Angeles police officer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over what period of time were you so employed?
Mr. KIMPLE. 1924 to 1944.
Mr. TAVENNER. During that period of time did you perform any secret assignment within the Communist Party?
Mr. KIMPLE. I was assigned by the Los Angeles Police Department to investigate the activities of the Communist Party in Los Angeles; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you become a member of the Communist Party in carrying out that assignment ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4027
Mr. SIMPLE. I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the period of your membership ?
Mr. KIMPLE. I joined the Communist Party in 1928, and maintained continuous membership until the fall of 1939.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hold any position in the Communist Party ?
Mr. KITPLE. I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that position? 
Mr. KIMPLE. Well, several positions. I was a unit organizer and a unit literature agent, and a unit educational director. I was the assistant to the Los Angeles County membership director, and I was the alternate on the Los Angeles disciplinary committee. Those are a few of the main jobs I held.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were assistant membership director?
Mr. KIMPLE. For the Los Angeles County membership department, yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over what period of time did you hold that position? 
Mr. KIMFLE. 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939, up until the time I was dropped from the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. As assistant membership director, did you have access to the membership records of the Communist Party of Los Angeles?
Mr. KIMPLE. The Communist Party membership records were in my personal control at all times; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you in the hearing room at the time the previous witness was excused temporarily from the witness stand?
Mr. KIMPLE. I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know his name? 
Mr. KMPLE. I know the name that I knew him by, yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is that name 
Mr. KIMPLE. Louis Schneiderman, brother of William Schneiderman. I knew him very well here in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you identify the individual who preceded you on the stand as being the Louis Schneiderman that you knew ?
Mr. KIMPLE. He is the same one; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. On what do you base the statement that he is the same person you knew as Louis Schneiderman?
Mr. KIMPLE. I was very well acquainted with William Schneiderman and Louis Schneiderman at the time that I was in the Communist Party here. I worked closely with him. I used to cart him around in my automobile considerably, and I knew him very well.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend any closed Communist Party meetings with him?
Mr. KIMPLE. I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently?
Mr. KIMPLE. A minimum of 4 or 5 times a year during the years of 1935, 1936.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you what purports to be a 1938 registration blank of the industrial section, and ask you to state what it is. (Document handed to the witness.) 4028 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. KEMPLE. That is an authentic 1938 Communist Party registration blank. From this registration blank the Communist Party membership books were made, and the Communist Party membership records maintained.
Mr. TAVENNER. What connection, if any, have you had with that particular blank which is before you?
Mr. KIMPLE. This particular blank was filled out in the Communist Party unit and sent back to the membership department, and from this blank the membership book for the year 1938 was filled out, and the 1938 membership record for the Communist Party membership records was made out.
Mr. TAVENNER. Does that blank show the name of the person who registered for the year 1938 ?
Mr. KIMPLE. It does.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name?
Mr. KIMPLE. Lou Schneiderman.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer a photostatic copy of the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Kimple Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. MOULDER. The document will be so marked and admitted in evidence. (See p. 4029.)
Mr. MOULDER. May I inquire, does it have a signature on it?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO. It is a printed name. I hand you another card, which is marked "Kimple Exhibit No. 2" for identification only, and ask you to tell us what it is.
Mr. KIMPLE. This is the control card for the first half of 1937 in the Communist Party membership records and in the Communist Party membership book. The last page in the membership book is a control card, and at the end of June of the year the membership department checks the membership books, and if the member is paid up in dues this control card is filled out, detached from the book and sent back to the membership department. That way the membership department knows that it has an active, dues-paying member.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that an original record?
Mr. KIMPLE. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whose control card is it ?
Mr. KIMPLE. That is also for Louis Schneiderman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you read what appears on the card?
Mr. KIMPLE. Printed is: Control card, first half of 1937. Book No. 75373. And I might add here that the book number of the Communist Party membership book and the control card were the same. Name: Louis Schneiderman. Stateand then there is a date6-22-37. County: L. A. City: L. A. District 13. Section IND- which meant industrial. Unit: Teamsters. Occupation: driver. Union: Teamsters.

Mr. KIMPLE. That is correct, yes, sir.
Mr. TAVNNER. Were all of the records of the Communist Party at that time required to be kept in that form
Mr. KIaiLE. I am sorry. I don't quite understand your question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were all of the control cards of the Communist Party members during the period that you were a member of the Communist Party required to show whether a member was a member of the Negro race or the white race?
Mr. KIMPLE. They were, yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Why was that?
Mr. KIMPLE. Well, the Communist Party kept an annual list of all Communist Party members, and it was broken down as to nationality, race, color, et cetera.
Mr. TAvENNER. So much has been said by representatives of the Communist Party as to there being no distinction or no discrimination between race or color, and I was wondering the reasons for asking what one's race is on the card. I hand you another document and ask you to examine it. It is marked "Kimple Exhibit No. 3" for identification only. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4031 Will you tell us what it is, please. (The document was handed to the witness.)
Mr. KIMPLE. That is a 1938 Communist Party membership book, made out to L. Schneiderman, State of California, District 13, County Los Angeles, City Los Angeles, Section Industrial, Unit Teamsters, and the book was issued on the 12th month, the 8th day, in the 37th year. And it carries the official Communist Party seal with the stamped signature of W. Schneiderman. It is paid up in dues through the month of October.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state whether or not that is the original Communist Party book of Louis Schneiderman ?
Mr. KiMPLE. It is, yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. The same person who appeared just ahead of you on the witness stand ?
Mr. KIMPLE. It is. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And answered to the name of Louis Sherman?
Mr. KIMPLE. Yes, it is. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer a photostatic copy of the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Kimple Exhibit No. 3."
Mr. MoULDER. The document will be so marked and admitted in evidence. (See pp. 4032 and 4033.) May I ask now, on what do you base your answer that this document is his Communist Party book.
Mr. KIMPLE. My knowledge of it. I base my answer on that, on the personal acquaintanceship I had with him, knowing him, knowing in what part of the Communist Party he was functioning, and recognizing this book as an official Communist Party book made out to him. And there was only one Louis Schneiderman in the Communist Party here in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions of this witness, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. Or do you want him temporarily excused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like for him to stand aside.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is temporarily excused.
Mr. KIMPLE. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MOULDER. The subpena which has been served upon you will remain in full force and effect (Witness temporarily excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Now may I ask Mr. Sherman to return to the witness stand. 4032 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA KImPLE EXHIBIT No. 3 5 I3 1 I, the, 6QG6% , j A INs cin 1, h- lh. y lsxe : i15T .", T. o oft"aQ, d -. 1 - '.d t i -4 1 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4033 KIMPIE EXHIBIT No. 3-Continued 1; I TESTIMONY OF LOUIS R. SHERMAN, ACCOMPANIED BY. COUNSEL, BEN MARGOLIS-Resumed
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Sherman, I hand you "Kimple Exhibit No. 3," and ask you to examine it and tell the committee whether or not that was your Communist Party membership book. (Document placed on the witness table.)
Mr. SHEMAN. I refuse to answer that question, Mr. Tavenner, on the same ground earlier stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you examine the book?
Mr. SHERMAN. No, I did not.
Mr. SCHERER. I want to ask one question. You have just heard the testimony of William Kimple, have you not?
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes.
Mr. SCHERER. Is anything that William Kimple told this committee about you untrue?
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Kimple is well known in this area, I understand, as an informer and a stool pigeon. I would not engage in any debate or discussion on the subject. Therefore, I refuse to answer the question.
Mr. SCHERER. I think he is a line American and has done a great job here in the Los Angeles area. But, whether you class him as a stool pigeon or not, my question is whether or not anything he said about you is untrue, no matter what you call him.
Mr. SHERMAN. I refuse to answer that question on the same grounds earlier stated.
Mr. SCHERER. We always talk about drawing an inference. I am just going to ask what other inference can anyone draw than that 4034 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA Kimple was telling the absolute truth because you refuse to even deny one iota of his testimony when you have an opportunity to do so, and have had an opportunity to hear his testimony. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. Who can criticize anybody for drawing an inference from your invocation of the fifth amendment under those circumstances?
Mr. SHERMAN. Creatures who get paid money for being informers and stool pigeons are the last ones in the world that should be listened to or given any credence to.
Mr. SCHERER. But still you will not deny that he has told the truth?
Mr. SHERMAN. I have answered the question on the grounds earlier stated.
Mr. SCHEREE. You refused to answer. You didn't answer.
Mr. SHERMAN. That is right, I refuse to answer in case there is any doubt in your mind.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. SchneidermanMr. SHERMAN. My name is Sherman, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you deny your name is Schneiderman ?
Mr. SIIERMAN. I have answered that question.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask you to direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MoULDER. The witness is directed to answer.
Mr. SHERMAN. I refuse to answer that question on the same grounds earlier stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Schneiderman, I hand you a copy of a March 25, 1947, issue of the Daily People's World, and call your attention to an article reciting that Lou Sherman, president, CIO, Warehousemen's Union, Local 26, and others had formed a citizens' committee to elect Elsie M. Monjar, Communist, running for the city council. Will you examine the article, please. (Document placed on the witness table.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee whether or not in 1947 you were endeavoring to assist the Communist Party in the area of Los Angeles by the formation of such a committee as referred to in that article?
Mr. SHEREMAN. I repeat, Mr. Tavenner, I am not accountable to this committee for any of my beliefs, my associations, my background and my history. Therefore, I refuse to answer your question, again on the same constitutional grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you the December 19, 1947, issue of the Daily People's World, and call your attention to an article entitled "Real Busy Meeting. Local 26 Elects, Registers Petitions." (Document placed on the witness table.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine it? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. IS there any reason why you do not desire to examine it ?
Mr. SIIHERAN. Will you repeat the question?
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine the paper that I have presented to you ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I don't care to examine the document. Will you kindly repeat the question ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4035
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you fully recall what I am speaking about without refreshing your recollection by examining the article?
Mr. SHERMAN. I fail to see any connection between the registration of citizens to vote and a Communist plot.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I have the article? (Document handed to Mr. Tavenner.)
Mr. TAVENNER. This article shows that a total of 110 petitions of the Independent Progressive Party were being circulated at your local meeting at a time when you were president. Will you tell the committee, please, whether or not that was being done at the instance of and as a part of the plan of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHERMAN. It seems to me that your question deals with a matter relating to what our union did at a certain time. I don't propose to get into any discussion about any of the internal affairs of our union. The executive board of our union has decided that this committee is not serving a useful legislative purpose, and members subpenaed before it should not cooperate to that extent. What you are insinuating-Mr. SCHERER. You say that is a decision of the union ?
Mr. SHERMAN. It is a matter relating to the internal affairs of our union.
Mr. SCHERER. You say it is a decision of the union that the members shall not cooperate with the committee ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I am repeating a very brief version, by the way, some of the substance of what the position is that was adopted by the executive board of our union last Wednesday night.
Mr. SCHERER. How many of that executive board are members of the Communist Party ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MARGOLIS. Why don't you let him answer one question at a time instead of constantly interrupting, Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCERER. I will ask these questions the way I see fit.
Mr. MARGOLIS. You appear to be doing that. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I have lost track of the questions, Mr. Tavenner. I am not sure which of the two I should answer first.
Mr. SCHERER. I will withdraw the first question, and ask youMr. SHERMAN. Which one do you want me to answer?
Mr. SCHERER. Ask you how many members of your executive board are members of the Communist Party.
Mr. SHERMAN. I don't think I should dignify your question with any suggestion of an answer. I would refuse on constitutional grounds to answer that question. I thought that Mr. Tavenner was asking something relating to a policy or a position that was adopted by our union.
Mr. TAVENNER. No, I absolutely did not. I did not ask you for any action taken by your union. I am asking for action that was taken by you or some other person in presenting 110 petitions at that meeting. To be more specific, did, you present any of the 110 petitions at that meeting ? 4036 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. SHERMAN. I will refuse to answer your question on the grounds not the that discussing any of the affairs of a labor union are really allowed property of this committee. But I will take the liberty, if I am to read a portion of a statement adopted by our union executive board dealing with this matterMr. SCHEREE. As long as he is refusing to answer and takes the fifth amendment, he cannot read any statement. If he answers the questions, we will give him all day to read a statement. But he hasn't answered one significant question we have asked. He has refused to answer.
Mr. SHERMAN. Let the record show, Mr. ChairmanMr. SCHERER. He hasn't even told us what his name is.
Mr. SHERMAN. That the witness has not limited his claim of privilege to the fifth amendment only. Only Mr. Scherer seems-Mr. SCIERER. It is the only one we recognize.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Scherer seems to prefer the fifth amendment. I will repeat: Any privileges claimed before this committee are the 1st and 5th amendments and the 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Mr. MOULDER. Yes; the record reveals that.
Mr. SHERMAN. I would also like to ask at this time, since reference has been made to a policy adopted by the union, that the union executive board statement adopted Wednesday night of this week be introduced into the record as the official statement that I introduce in my own behalf. I subscribe to it. I will adhere to every single word in it, and I offer it in evidence.
Mr. MOULDER. The statement will be filed.
Mr. SCHERER. No. I object to it being filed as a part of the record. If he answers the question how many Communists were on the board that adopted that statement, I will agree that it go in. But, until he answers that, I object to any action of a union board with reference to its attitude toward this committee being offered or made a part of this record.
Mr. SIHERMAN. That reinforces my belief, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. It is filed as a part of the proceedings. That doesn't mean that it is a part of the printed record. (The statement referred to was filed for the information of the committee to be retained in its files.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me go back to the question I originally asked you. It was not a matter relating to any policy of your union at all. What I am interested in is the policy of the Communist Party in the promotion of the interest of the Independent Progressive Party. I am going to ask you again who took the 110 petitions for the Independent Progressive Party to your union meeting?
Mr. SHERMAN. Do you want me to name the 110 people who circulated petitions to put the Progressive Party on the ballot in California?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO. We have quite a bit of evidence about that. But who took them to this meeting ? 
Mr. SHERMAN. I really don't remember. But if I did I would still refuse to answer the question on the same constitutional grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whose plan was it to take these petitions to your meeting? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4037
Mr. SHERMAN. The same questionMr. TAVENNER. Was it the Communist Party ?
Mr. SHERMAN. With the same answer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you aware of the plan of the Communist Party to substitute the Independent Progressive Party for the Communist Party on the ballot in the State of California? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I think you are assuming something that is your own private opinion. But I choose to refuse to answer your question.
Mr. TAVENNER. You could probably enlighten the committee. The committee has heard considerable evidence on that subject. In your prominence possibly you could help the committee if you would, if you were willing.
Mr. SHERMAN. I would never stoop to the level of the informers to help this committee violate any part of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that because in 1947 you were a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SHERMAN. I have answered that. I refuse on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been a subscriber to the Daily People's World?
Mr. SHERMAN. Now we are dealing with the whole question of freedom of the press and freedom to read the press. I read a lot of news- papers. It is part of my job as a representative of the union to read the labor press and a lot of the other metropolitan papers in and around the State of California.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you answer the question, please ?
Mr. SHERMAN. In response to that specific question, I don't believe I have to answer as to whether I have read or subscribed to this particular paper or any other paper. I would refuse to answer that question on constitutional grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. The question is whether or not you were a subscriber. Does that change your answer?
Mr. SHERMAN. NO. My answer is still the same.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the December 24, 1947, issue of the Daily People's World, you reminded the stewards of your union that they should subscribe to the Daily People's World. Did you do that?
Mr. SHERMAN. I don't recall the incident, Mr. Tavenner, but if I did I would still refuse to answer the question on the same constitutional grounds. It happened to be an internal affair. That is the right of a union-solely to determine its own affairs, and the right of the members to determine the policies of the union and who their officers and representatives shall be. If you intend to go into that matter I shall refuse to answer that question on that particular ground in addition to the usual grounds offered earlier.
Mr. SCHERER. May I make this observation, Mr. Chairman, that the union certainly does have the right to determine its own internal affairs and elect its own officers. But the union in so doing should have all of the facts concerning its officers.
Mr. SHERMAN. Are you proposing to be- 
Mr. SCHERER. Some facts should not be hidden from them.
Mr. SHERMAN. Are you proposing to be the last word? 4038 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE IOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. SCHERER. Namely, Communist membership of some of its officers. If they know that and still want to elect them, then that is perfectly all right.
Mr. SHERMAN. Apparently you see it your function to tell the members of our union and many other unions who their elected representatives shall be.
Mr. SCHERER. I didn't say that.
Mr. SHERMAN. That is exactly what you inferred. You would like to be the judge of who shall be the elected representatives of labor unions in this country.
Mr. SCHERER. I just say that I think every union member has the right to know who in its membership are members of the Communist Party and what the correct names and what the background of its officers are so that they can exercise a free choice. And then, knowing that background, if they still want to elect that individual, they have the perfect right to do so.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a petition of the Independent Progressive Party of California, at the end of which there is an affidavit bearing date the 26th day of January 1948. (Document placed on the witness table.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine it, please, and state who signed the affidavit?
Mr. SHERMAN. I am sorry I don't follow your question, Mr. Tavenner. Would you mind repeating it?
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine the petition and state whether or not you signed the affidavit that appears at the bottom of it?
Mr. SHERMAN. I don't propose to examine the affidavit, but I would like to hear your question again.
Mr. TAVENNER. Again ? 
Mr. SCHERER. Wait a minute. I move that the witness be directed to examine the document in order that Mr. Tavenner may propound the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Sherman Exhibit No. 1," for identification.
Mr. MOULDER. The exhibit will be so marked and admitted in evidence. (This exhibit is similar to Kalman Bloch exhibit No. 1, p. 3957, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. MOULDER. Now the exhibit is before you, Mr. Sherman, and you are directed to examine it for the purpose of qualifying yourself to answer questions or to decline to answer questions which may be propounded by counsel. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I am going to refuse to answer any questions concerning this document. So I, therefore, propose to refuse to examine the document.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, the affidavit at the end of the document appears over the name of the affiant, Louis Sherman. And it states under oath that Louis Sherman was the person who circulated that document and who procured the signatures on that document. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4039 
Mr. MOULDEn. I do not believe the witness was asked a question as to whether or not he did circulate the petition and sign the affidavit you referred to.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you obtain the signatures appearing on the document presented to you?
Mr. SHERMAN. I again refuse to answer the question on the same grounds earlier indicated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it a part of the Communist Party plan that you should circulate that document and obtain others in your union to follow your bidding in such action?
Mr. SHERMAN. It seems to me that Henry Wallace was the founder of the third party movement in this country some years ago, which resulted in the establishment of this party. I don't propose to go into it, Mr. Tavenner. I don't think it is a proper subject for the inquiry of this committee. And I properly will refuse to answer this question on constitutional grounds.
Mr. SCHERER. The unions and everybody else have the right to know whether any of its officers are using the unions to promote Communist Party programs within the union. They have that right to that knowledge. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. Then, as I said before, if, having that knowledge, they want to take certain action, they have a right to do it. And this committee proposes to show how the Communist Party used the unions in certain cases to promote objectives of the Communist Party and not necessarily the fine objectives of the union, and without the knowledge of the rank and file.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Tavenner, those remarks of Mr. Scherer are highly offensive and insulting to the members of the union I represent. It assumes that they haven't got enough brains to make up their own minds about any question, whether it be political or economic. I just want to remind you that any position that this union has ever taken on any matter, whether it involves wages or politics or economics, have been taken with the knowledge and the approval of the members of our union.
Mr. SCHERER. Have you told the union at any time that you were an active member of the Communist Party (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. You are assuming something, Mr. Scherer.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask you direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have stated on innumerable earlier occasions that I will refuse to answer that and any of the similar questions on constitutional grounds. That is an invasion of the privacy and of the rights of any American, and I don't propose to allow this committee to do it tome.
Mr. SCHERER. When you are not under oath and when you are at union meetings don't you think the union has the-right to know from you, when you are not under oath, whether or not you are a member of the Communist Party (The witness confers with his counsel.) 77436-56-pt. 10- 10 4040 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. SHERMAN. If you were a member of the union you would have a right to get up and propose that. I doubt if the members of our union would listen to you.
Mr. SCHERER. You still evaded the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Holding the positions that you have held since 1947 in your local union, were you required to sign what is known as the Taft-Hartley affidavit, affidavit of non-Communist union officer? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. This again, Mr. Tavenner, is a matter that involves the internal affairs of our union. Various unions choose to comply or not to comply, depending upon their own peculiar circumstances, conditions, or their own choosing. Whether our union does it or does not, whether we signed or did not sign is a matter, I believe, for union mem- bers to determine. And it is an internal matter of the unon, and not a subject for inquiry of this committee.
Mr. SCHERER. Let's correct that a little bit. That is a law. Whether you agree with the law or not, I assume that all unions follow the law. And we are very much interested in whether or not an individual complies with the provisions of the Taft-Hartley law. It certainly is a proper subject of investigation of this committee because it deals directly with a union member saying whether or not he is a member of the Communist Party. And that is what we are investigating.
Mr. MOULDER. You mean officers.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Scherer, you are inferring that unions that do not so-called comply are perhaps living outside the law. May I remind you that there are some great labor organizations in this country, like the United Mine Workers and International Typographical Union, who do not choose to abide by the affidavit provisions of the Taft-Hartley law. But I would say unequivocally that every labor union in this country abides by the law. And whether or not it seeks to exercise its rights under the National Labor Relations Act is a matter primarily of its own choosing. Some do and some don't. But don't attribute any evil motives to those that may or may not.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have taken 10 minutes to avoid answering my question. Were you required as an officer to sign a non-Communist affidavit?
Mr. SHERMAN. I refuse to answer that question on the same constitutional grounds announced earlier.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a non-Communist union officer's affidavit marked "Sherman Exhibit No. 2," and I ask you to examine it and state whether or not you signed it. (Document placed on the witness table.) 
Mr. SHERMAN. I will refuse to answer that question. Therefore, it is no use or need for me to examine the document.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Sherman Exhibit No. 2." 
Mr. MoULDER. The document will be so marked and admitted in evidence. (This exhibit is similar to Al Caplan exhibit No. 1, p. 4056, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4041 
Mr. MOULDER. I would suggest that, first, the witness be directed to examine the document in order that he might have an opportunity to qualify himself to answer the questions you may ask him about it. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I will answer no questions about this document, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you also decline or refuse to examine it?
Mr. SHERMAN. Therefore, there is no need for me to examine this document I refer to.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the date of the sworn statement?
Mr. WHEELER. The 12th day of January 1956.
Mr. TAVENNER. The document reads as follows: The undersigned, being duly sworn, deposes and says: "1. I am a responsible officer of the union named below; "2. I am not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party; "3. I do not believe in and I am not a member of nor do I support any organization that believes in or teaches the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional means." Warehouse, Processing and Distribution Workers Union, Local 26, International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. Louis R. SHERMAN, (Signature) Secretary-Treasurer, 9517 Ceylon Avenue, Los Angeles 45, Calif. Sworn and subscribed to before me this 12th day of January 1956, a notary public or other person authorized by law to administer oaths and take acknowledgements in and for the county of Los Angeles, State of California. My commission expires November 27, 1959. Jacob Lehman is the signature. Were you a member of the Communist Party on the 12th day of January 1956, the date of this sworn affidavit?
Mr. SHERMAN. I refuse to answer that question on the same constitutional grounds announced earlier.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer in evidence a second affidavit of non-Communist union officer marked "Sherman Exhibit No. 3," for identification, bearing date of January 6, 1955, and I will ask you to examine it and state whether or not you gave that sworn statement on the date indicated.
Mr. MOULDER. The document will be so marked and admitted in evidence. (Document placed on the witness table.)
Mr. SHERMAN. I will again refuse to answer that question on the same constitutional grounds indicated earlier.
Mr. MoULDER. Witness, you are directed to examine the document referred to by counsel, marked "Sherman Exhibit No. 3."
Mr. SHERMAN. For the same reason, Mr. Chairman, I will refuse to examine the document. It is unnecessary since I am not going to answer the question anyway.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party on the 6th day of January 1955?
Mr. SHERMAN. I refuse to answer that question on the same constitutional grounds announced earlier.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you execute a non-Communist affidavit for the year 1954?
Mr. SHERMAN. I will again refuse to answer that question on the same constitutional grounds. 4042 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA

Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Thomas A. Chapman.
Mr. MOULDER. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn, please. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God ?
