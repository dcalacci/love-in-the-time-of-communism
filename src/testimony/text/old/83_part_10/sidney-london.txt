Mr. LONDON. I do not recall this specific instance that the counselor is speaking of, nor would I, if I did recall, dignify that question or other questions of this nature with an answer that this committee wants me to give on the basis of attempting to prove something about the union to which I belong as being infiltrated or dominated or controlled by some sinister forces such as might be represented according to the inference of this question by myself, and I therefore will refuse to answer this question on the grounds of the 1st, the 9th, the 10th, and the 5th amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you secretary of the educational bureau of the Young Communist League in 1941 in the city of New York?
Mr. LONDON. I believe that I have stated my position on this, that any attempt being made to divide or influence the members of my union so that they can squabble among themselves as to who is or who is not a Communist, a Republican, a Democrat, and forget that they are trade unionists, is none of the committee's business, and I will refuse to answer this question as I will all similar questions on the basis of the 1st, 9th, 10th, and 5th amendments.
Mr. MOULDER. In any future questions propounded to you which you refuse to answer, you might state that you are reiterating the reasons for declining to answer which you have already given. Is that agreeable with you, Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCHERER. Yes. 
Mr. LONDON. All right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Young Communist League in the city of New York in 1941?
Mr. LONDON. Counselor Tavenner, I would like to make one position very clear. I am here because I am an active member of local 26 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's UnionMr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, the answer is not responsive to my question.
Mr. MOULDER. It certainly isn't. It will help us expedite the proceedings, if you refuse to answer or decline to answer for the reasons stated by you. It would help you and help us if you do so.
Mr. TAVENNER. What did you tell the committee your employment had been between 1948 and the present time in California ? I know you testified to that, but I do not recall what you said. 4050 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA

Mr. TAVENNER. I think I should read the date of the document which is August 19, 1948. Did you live at 827 Lafayette Avenue, Borough of Brooklyn, in August of 1948? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. LONDON. I am going to refuse to answer this question on the grounds previously stated, as I can see no reason why it is the business of this committee to know exactly where I have lived.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been a member of the Communist Party in the city of Los Angeles at any time since the beginning of your present employment in 1963 ?
Mr. LONDON. I will refuse to answer this question and I also want to say that I am invoking the 9th and 10th amendments of the Constitution as well as the 1st and 5th because the 9th and 10th amendments of the Constitution, dealing with delegated powers, as has already been previously stated by former witnesses, implies and has been so held that the people are sovereign for those powers that have not been delegated to elected representatives of Government. And it is more than an implication that representatives in Congress, or any other legislative body, are there to serve the people and not to have the people serve them. I have only seen this committee do one kind of service in the main, and that is the service of subpenas. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been a member of the Communist Party at any time since 1948, up until the time of your present employment?
Mr. LONDON. If somebody has made that assertion-and I don't particularly want to do this-I would like to refer the committee to a quotation from Mark 15: 2-5 of the Bible where: Pilate asked him, "Art thou the King of the Jews ?" And He- Jesusanswering said unto him, "Thou sayest it." And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, "Answerest thou nothing?" beholdMr. MOULDER. What is the question, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. He has refused to answer that question.
Mr. MOULDER. Let's have the next question.
Mr. LONDON. I beg your pardon, sir. I haven't been directed to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you want to be directed?
Mr. SCHERER. Regular order. Let's go with the next question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer.
Mr. LONDON. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. LONDON. I refuse to answer that and all similar questions that are being put by this committee for the purposes of dividing our union and trying to inject controversial issues into a place of business or a union where the.members have the sole right of deciding for themselves who is or what is anything.
Mr. MOULDER. You have a reasonable time to either answer the question or decline to answer it.
Mr. LONDON. I decline to answer this question on the grounds previously stated. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4053 
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. Call the next witness, please.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Alfred H. Caplan.
Mr. MOULDER. Would you kindly hold up your right hand? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
