Mr. TAVENNER. How have you been employed in your work as a social worker ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. GLOBE. Would you be more specific, please?
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your employment as a social worker since 1950 ?
Mr. GLOBE. I find the questioning as to my employment a little difficult to accept under the circumstances. I can't quite see how my employment, my employment experience, present or past, can be the concern of the committee. I do my work and I do it as well as I can, and that is the situation. I don't understand the line of your questioning, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. ScHERER. Mr. Chairman, I ask that you direct the witness to answer Mr. Tavenner's question with reference to his employment. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. JACKSON. It is a matter of proper identification.
Mr. MOULDER. At the request of members of the committee, the witness is directed to answer the question. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. GLOBE. I have been employed as a social worker, or at least in social agencies twice. The present employment is that of a social worker, and the past employment was also. In 1950 I worked as a social worker in a social agency.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where?
Mr. GLOBE. In Los Angeles. 
Mr. SCHERER. By whom are you presently employed ?
Mr. GLOBE. By the County of Los Angeles.
Mr. SCHERER. As a social worker?
Mr. GLOBE. That is correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you attend school between 1946 and 1950?
Mr. GLOBE. I answered that question already.
Mr. TAVENNEB. You said you attended school, but you didn't state where, according to my recollection.
Mr. GLOBE. University of Southern California.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was the period that you were taking graduate work, I believe. Is that correct'
Mr. GLOBE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you familiar with an organization in that school composed largely of graduate students known as the John Reed Club of the Communist Party?
Mr. GLOBE. My familiarity or lack of familiarity with any organization that might exist in the country today is entirely my own business, and termed under the Constitution of the United States. This is a matter of personal knowledge. I don't think that this committee has any right to inquire into my personal knowledge in this or any other respect since they cannot legislate what I do nor what I do not know, or what I intend to know.
Mr. ScHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mr. GLOBE. Finding the question completely out of line as far as my rights as a citizen are concerned, I refuse to answer this question COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3917 under the first and fifth amendments of the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the John Reed Club of the Communist Party while in attendance at the university ?
Mr. GLOBE. This question is even more objectionable than the first one for the same reasons I previously stated, and I object to it, and I refuse to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with any of the activities of a group of the Communist Party known as the John Reed Club.
Mr. GLOBE. I refuse to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you observe Communist Party activities since 1950 of any persons known to you to be members of the John Reed Club of the Communist Party while you were at the university ?
Mr. GLOBE. I feel, Mr. Tavenner, if you want information about names, people, and anything else that you might be concerned with, I suggest that you get one of your trained seals up here and ask them. I refuse to answer this. Anyone or any associations I may have had in the past or expect to have in the future are entirely my own. I refuse to answer this question, as it is an invasion of my rights, invasion of the rights of all the American citizens. I refuse to answer on the basis of the first and fifth amendments, both.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. GLOBE. I refuse to answer this question, as previously stated, for previous reasons, and on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOLE. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Jackson
Mr. JACKsoN. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCHERER. Did this witness say he served in the Armed Forces of the United States?
Mr. GLOBE. I certainly did.
Mr. SCHERER. While you were a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, Witness, were you a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. GLOBE. I refuse to answer. First and fifth amendments. You have no right to ask.
Mr. SCHERER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. I have one question. Do you have any knowledge or information of subversive or communistic activities of any person? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. It is not funny, Witness, at all.
Mr. GLOBE. It is a rather difficult question to answer, since it contains so many elements that are implied and have not been established since I have been on the stand. As far as I am concerned, these implications have not been established in the country at all. The whole ideaMr. SCHERER. You say there has been no establishment in this country of subversive activities when our atomic secrets were stolen and 3918 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA now rest in the archives of the Kremlin because of subversives in Government? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. GLOBE. I would be glad to discuss this or any other question you might ask meMr. SCITEREn. When you are not under oath. 
Mr. GLOBE. When I am not on the stand under the circumstances of this committee; where I would be glad to discuss it under oath if you, too, were under oath, sir. Under the circumstances I feel that I am, since I am a target for what seems to be and has been proved to be quite unprincipled attacks that are aimed at maligning and destroying a person's working ability, I refuse to answer this question on the same grounds as previously.
Mr. MOULDER. Is that all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. The committee will stand in recess for a period of 5 minutes. (Whereupon, a short recess was taken, Representatives Moulder, Doyle, Jackson and Scherer being present.) (The committee was reconvened upon the expiration of the recess; present: Representatives Moulder, Doyle, and Jackson.)
Mr. MOULDER. The committee will be in order. Call your next witness, please, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Don Ohristlieb.
Mr. MOULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn, please. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I do.
Mr. MOULDE. Please be seated. TESTIMONY OF DON CHRISTLIEB
