Mr. CHRISTLIEB.
Mr. TAVENNER.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. What is your name, please, sir? Don Christlieb. Will you spell your name, please? That is C-h-r-i-s-t-l-i-e-b. (Representative Gordon H. Scherer returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. It is the practice of the committee to advise all wit- nesses who appear before it that they have the right to have counsel with them if they desire it.
Mr. CHRISTLnEB. I understand. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And the right to confer with counsel at any time during the period of their questioning. When and where were you born, Mr. Christlieb?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I was born in Fullerton, Calif., October 10, 1912.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now reside?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. In Los Angeles, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Musician, instrumentalist.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been professionally engaged as an instrumentalist?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Since 1936. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3919 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been?
Mr. CHRISTLRB. I attended the public schools in Los Angeles through Los Angeles Junior College.
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your employment record since completion of your school?
Mr. CHISTLIEB. Since 1937 I have been employed as a musician in studio recording orchestras, and I have worked in every studio at one time or other.
Mr. TAVENNE. Was your employment interrupted by military service?
Mr. CHRIBTIEB. Yes. In 1934-1935 I enlisted for 2 years and 2 months in the Army, and I have an honorable discharge.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, whether or not as a musician you were requested to affiliate with the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you become affiliated ?
Mr. CaISTunEB. Yes, I did. In, I think-before Pearl Harbor, in 1941. 
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain in the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. As nearly as I can determine it was about the end of 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have not been a member of the Communist Party since that time? 
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. No, I have not, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, the circumstances of your affiliation with the Communist Party in the first place?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. I believe that I hoped for a form of society which could avoid the extremes of depression and war, and I think that the threat of fascism at that time involving the world was a period of cynicism and pessimism in late 1939 and the late 1940's. And I believe while many people were window-shopping for socialism here, I went in and made a purchase of merchandise I considered unreturnable and too hot to handle, and I have been returning small pieces painfully year after year, and I hope I can return a small piece today that is left.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just how were you recruited into the Communist Party? Would you tell us that?
Mr. CHRISTmEB. I think that it is a very individualistic thing with musicians, in the Musicians Branch. It is one of the few times when party work is such, musicians' work in the branch is such, that the individual personality and ingenuity and training and talent is given full play, and it is usually made by contact of an individual seeking to recruit a person they may consider eligible. That person is usually asked to read at that time the Daily People's World and many articles of that sort, which I was, too.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you describing now what happened in your own case?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. Yes, and I believe similar cases around me. And I think that after reading of such articles and so forth, we were approached by members that were in the party and asked how we felt about what we were reading, and so forth, and if we would care to attend Marxist classes. 3920 coMMVUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES; CAL F., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend Marxist classes?
Mr. CIRISTLIEB. Yes, I did, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. For how long a period of time?
Mr. CHRISTIEB. I only attended about four sessions, as such.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall any teachers of those sessions?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. No, I do not. I could only guess that it was someone sent from the section. I don't believe I ever saw him after that.
Mr. TAVENNER. By "section," do you mean a section of the Communist Party ?
Mr. CHRISTLrEB. That is right. I think it was called the Northwest Section, under which the branches, the musicians particular branch came.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you tell the committee, please, just what happened when you completed that course of study?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes. After the completion of the four sessions I was asked if I still wished to join the party, and if I did-which I did-the branch would then meet and vote on my acceptance, which they did. And that was all the formality needed to attend the first meeting of the branch as such. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the person by whom you were recruited?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Mischa Altman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know where Mischa Altman is now
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I believe he is in Europe at the present time-I think France.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there other persons who had taken this course with you, or this reading, this study course ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, there were.
Mr. TAVENNER. And who were also recruited into the Communist Party at that time ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall their names
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes. There were Haakon Berg-Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell both names ?
Mr. CHRSTLIEB. H-a-a-k-o-n B-e-r-g.
Mr. TAVENNER. He had taken this study course with you and went into the Communist Party with you?
Mr. CHRSTLIEB. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether he withdrew from the Communist Party before you did?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes. I think that he went into defense work and then into the Army quite soon afterward.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall the other persons from your study group who went into the Communist Party with you?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes. There were George PepperMr. TAVENNER. Was George Pepper a musician ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, that is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are there any others that you recall?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. There were their wives also.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you remember the name of the wife of George Pepper?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. It was Joy. And with Mr. Berg it was Ann.
Mr. TAVENNER. After you were taken into the Communist Party were you assigned to an organized group? COMMUNIST ACTIfITIES IN THE LOS AN GLES, CALIF., AREA 3921 
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That particular branch was, I believe, called branch O.
Mr. TAVENNER. Branch O. Was that the musicians' branch?
Mr. CHOPITLIEB. Correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you remain a member of that same branch during your entire membership in the Communist Party or were you at any time transferred to another group ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I never knew it to be under any other title, in my experience.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, how frequently this group of the Communist Party met?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I think, the average of once every 2 weeks, although a few members, I think, met on the off weeks to continue their study.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you tell the committee more about the plan of study of the Communist Party as you found it after you became a member?
Mr. CHnISTLIEB. That was usually handled by a person called the literature director. And we studied such volumes as the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and portions of the text on Karl Marx by Marion and portions of a volume called Dialectical and Historical Materialism by Guest, and also many pamphlets, the most prominent of which was, I believe, Political Action. I believe the text came once a month on the practical application of Marxism. Political Action is the name of the magazine.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over how long a period of time did you continue your Marxist studies?
Mr. CmISTLIFB. I would guess 1 year.
Mr. TAvENNER. Did functionaries of the Communist Party on a higher level come into your meetings at any time for the purpose of conducting educationals ?
Mr. CHrISTLIEB. In this case it was mostly the senior member in the branch. I refer specifically to Mischa Altman.
Mr. TAVENNER. You refer to the literature director of your group as playing an important part in the educational phase of your work. Who was the literature director?
Mr. CHISTLIEB. I can't recall at the moment, because those officers did rotate quite frequently, and sooner or later most everyone occupied that chair.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were the persons you considered to be the leaders of this group of the Communist Party from their activities?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I think it was pretty well shared by Mischa Altman and Sam Albert.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many persons composed this group at any one time ? What do you think was the maximum number ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. The number in attendance seemed to be 20 when well attended, perhaps less most other times.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give the committee a fairly correct idea of the number of persons who were members of branch O of the Communist Party during your membership in it?
Mr. CHRISvMEB. I think possibly a little later when the branch itself discussed it that they placed the number at about 60 or 65. That refers to the coming and going, members moving in and out of the Los Angeles area, or transfers from out of town. 3922 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the chief objective of this Communist Party organization at the time when you first became a member of it?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. The musicians, of course, would be, as with many branches, as closely related to its trade union as possible, and ours was, of course, with Musicians Local 47, A. F. of M. Other objectives, of course, were to grow, recruit, and so forth.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to place the location of branch 0. In what general section of the city was that ?
Mr. CnRISTLIEB. Generally in the Hollywood area.
Mr. JACKSON. In the homes of various members?
Mr. CHiSTLIEB. Right.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say you met in the homes of the members?
Mr. CwISTLIEB. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall at this time the names of the mem- bers in whose homes you met? 
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, I can. It would be Mischa Altman, Sam Albert, Haakon Berg, George Pepper, Carroll HollisterMr. TAVENNER. Would you spell the first and last names?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. C-a-r-r-o-l-l H-o-l-l-i-s-t-e-r. At the home of Joe DiFiore.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. D-i F-i-o-r-e. And my home. 
Mr. TAVENNER. In these various courses of training given within the Communist Party club itself, did you ever study American history ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I believe the only text-and I don't believe that was participated in by the branch in general-was a history of the American labor movement. I believe it was Anthony Bimba.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you active in connection with the establishment of the Musicians Congress?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Not in the outset, if you mean establishment or origin. But I think soon afterward, after the large initial meeting or congress was held on the UCLA campus I did join and tried to participate.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hold any position at any time in the Musicians Congress?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes. For about 2 months I was on the board.
Mr. TAVENNER. What activity did you observe within the Communist Party in connection with the Musicians Congress?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I think about the time I entered the congress as such, it was my experience to see the Communist Party in the midst of tremendous disagreement and quarrel. each accusing the other side of being opportunists, which was the party's way in using the organization for their own personal benefit. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee as fully as you can your experience with the Musicians Congress. To what extent its offices were infiltrated by members of the Communist Party, and what the Communist Party was trying to do with it ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I think when it started at UCLA, and perhaps on some of the literature concerning its origin, it had as its object building morale in peacetime and it had a considerable amount of just straight musical events. That meant a rather broad participation, making it possible for musicians in all fields to enter into it as well as members of the party, which by the sheer number of meetings and so forth, COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3923 could be used by Communist Party individuals for individual recruiting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of its executive board ?
Mr. CHmSTLIEB. Yes. I had submitted a small paper on the problems of instrumentalists and the particular instrument I play, and I believe it was at the recommendation of the secretary of the Musicians Congress that I was asked to be a member of the board.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have before me a letterhead of the Musicians Congress, November 23, 1945, which I ask be marked for identification purposes only, as "Christlieb Exhibit No. 1," and to be retained in the files of the committee. An examination of the letterhead shows that at that time there were 23 persons on the executive board and that you were one of them. Will you examine that list, please, and give us the names of those on it whom you can identify from your own personal knowledge to have been members of the Communist Party at that time.
Mr. CHrISTLIEB. I see organizational secretary, Mischa Altman; financial secretary, Leonard Selic.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the spelling of that last name ?
Mr. CRISTmIEB. S-e-l-i-c.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. CHRISTIEB. I met with him formally at meetings in our various homes.
Mr. JACKsoN. Meetings closed to all except members of the Communist Party
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Closed meetings; correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you proceed, please ?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. Joe DiFiore, Carroll HollisterMr. TAVENNER. Is the latter individual the same individual to whom you referred a few moments ago?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct; and Tamara Hovey.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the name?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. H-o-v-e-y.
Mr. TAVENNER. The first name?
Mr. CHISTLIEB. T-a-m-a-r-a. The next name is Earl Robinson.
Mr. TAVENNER. R-o-b-i-n-s-o-n.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Also meeting in private homes in closed meetings. George Sandell. And that is all I see here.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have not identified a person by the name of Leon Becker. Do you see his name?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I see his name, sir, but I didn't meet him formally at any meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. I wish to tell the committee that he has been identified in public testimony as a member of the Communist Party and our information is that he is now a Canadian citizen, is in England and has renounced his United States citizenship. Do you see the name of Jay Gorney ? 3924 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. CIRISTLIEB. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. He has been identified in other public testimony.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. But never in the Musicians Branch that I was in.
Mr. TAVENNER. David Raksin. Do you see his name as one of those ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEs. Yes, but the same applies there. He never met with the instrumentalists' branch.
Mr. TAVENNER. David Raksin has appeared before this committee formally:and admitted former Communist Party membership. Do you see there the name of Wachsman, W-a-c-h-s-m-a-n?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes; I do. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What is his first name
Mr. CIHISTLIEB. Bob, I see here. But the same thing holds there also.
Mr. TAVENN R. Robert Wachsman has appeared, Mr. Chairman, before this committee and refused to answer any material questions relying upon the fifth amendment. In what way did the Communist Party participate, if any, in the decisions that were arrived at by the executive board of this organization
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. It was my experience, as I said before, to find this organization in the midst of a tremendous quarrel, and from that time on nothing constructive was ever arrived at. I think I saw actually the destruction of the Musicians Congress because of these quarrels.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were those quarrels within the Communist Party or within the Musicians Congress, or in what way were they related?
Mr. CHTRISTLIEB. It was in the branch as well as in the congress itself. Of course, the language and the phraseology used in the congress itself had to be tempered because there were many who were not members of the party. But this, I say, made very little sense to people outside of the party. 'And if I may say here, at the time the chairman of this organization was not, certainly not a member of the party. And I think I should say something in his behalf. I know that he was devoted to music and wanted only to be identified with the making of music. And he used to complain to me considerably about the fact that Mischa Altman would want to talk doctrine with him. And his answer was always, "If we can make music together, let's make music, and I will meet with you on that basis." And I think it was with this simple principle alone, and nothing else, he stayed with the organization until its end out of respect to the many people that were not members of the Communist Party, and should be complimented for it. He probably has suffered some abuse for this, but I think he should be commended. Because with about the only weapon being music he was able to frustrate the aims of the party, and certainly cause Mr. Mischa Altman perhaps one of the greatest of frustrations I have ever seen in an individual because he actually wanted to capture the mind of Lawrence Morton, and he couldn't do this.
Mr. DOYLE. Who was that chairman ?
Mr. CHnusn B. Lawrence Morton.
Mr. TAVENNER. So that the Communist Party had something in mind other than the matter of promoting music for music's sake; is that what you are telling us
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, sir. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3925 
Mr. TAVENNER. I wish you would describe that situation more fully to the committee, giving as full an understanding of it as you can. Tell the whole story, what it was about, and what occurred.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I can only say that if this had been a success that they had planned for it, it would have been a tremendous feather in the cap of the Communist Party members, and it would have been a tremendous asset to their recruiting program. 
Mr. SCHERER. Do you think it was largely due to the position taken by this one man, the chairman of the group, that they were not successful? 
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I certainly do. I think that is the greatest lesson that could be learned from a man, that a single individual could take that stand and be that successful.
Mr. TAVENNER. When the Communist Party was unable to influence the chairman of that organization, what did they do? What was the result of the situation? Did they go along with the organization or did they take a course of action which brought about its destruction ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Some of them retired from the committee formally, as I did, but the quarrel went on up into the section.
Mr. TAVENNER. The section of the Communist Party ? 
Mr. CHmSTIEB. That is right, through the branch, through the branch itself and the section where the same charges were leveled at each other and referees were appointed, more like a kangaroo court. No decision was ever handed down, however.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us more in detail about it. I don't understand how this issue in the Musicians Congress finally found its way to the section group, which was a higher level than your own group of the Communist Party. (Representative Morgan M. Moulder left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. CHRISTLEB. Since there were so many people, as you know, from the branch involved, their time must have accounted for something. The considerable length of time that the members did spend in the congress, they should have gotten some results. And there were none forthcoming. Certainly the section is going to ask why not. It was a stalemate, and for a long period of time.
Mr. DOYLE (presiding). In other words, the efforts of the Communist Party members within the Musicians Congress were to control the Musicians Congress with the doctrine of the Communist Party instead of for music's sake. And that effort by the Communist Party cell in the Musicians Congress failed to such an extent that their failure was carried on up into the higher level of the Communist Party control ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct. 
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, they were held for an accounting by a higher level in the Communist Party, and that is right here in Los Angeles?
Mr. CHRImTLIEB. Correct. 
Mr. DOYLE. What year?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I believe the congress started in 1944, but I believethis was in 1945, the latter period of 1945, because I know by the first. part of 1946 they had had it dissolved. 3926 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. SCHERER. DO you think that dissolution was due to this conflict and failure upon the part of the Communists to succeed with the congress?
Mr. CHRISTrIEB. It certainly was with me, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. It was with you. In other words, the Communists could not control it so they destroyed it?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. It had that effect.
Mr. DOYLE. I would think that the record should show, based upon the testimony of this witness, that the musicians' group in Los Angeles is entitled to a compliment from this committee in resisting the subversive activities of the Communist cell within the musicians' group as related by you, Mr. Christlieb.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, sir. 
Mr. JACKSON. The role to be played, as I understand it, by the Communist branch was to obtain control of the Musicians Congress. Now, what contribution, after having obtained control of the congress, or what was your concept of the contribution that could be made by this Communist-controlled congress to the work of the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I wish I could point to a single bit of evidence, but I can't. 
Mr. JACKSON. There was no specific goal that you knew of?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. I think the greatest principles of the congress were set down at its formation when it held the congress at UCLA on the campus, and it held such promise that afterwards it could continue, but it did not.
Mr. JACKsoN. Aside from the political aspect of this branch of the Communist Party, were there discussions among the musicians as to what contribution they could make as a group toward assisting the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. You mean within the party itself ?
Mr. JACKSON. Yes; within the branch.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Actually, the quarrel divided the party itself into small groups that caucused among themselves, and I never sat in on one of those so I am not able to tell. I know that they did meet with the idea concerning what you have asked, but I was not a part of that.
Mr. JAcKSON. What I am trying to arrive at was where were these groups of Communist musicians going, if anywhere? What was the ultimate goal they were seeking to achieve? Or was this simply a facet of the overall drive to capture an entire industry? It is still not quite clear to me just exactly what the ultimate goal was in terms of the Communist Party.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I see.
Mr. SCHERER. Membership? Dues?
Mr. JACKSON. Yes, aside from the obvious thing, such as the contri- bution which could be made financially, and culturally. We have the picture of the Soviet cultural arts. Was the intent to bring about in the United States such a siutation as was described here several days ago by another witness? (Representative Morgan M. Moulder returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. CRISTLIEB. Certainly prestige, of course. But then also, I think, one of the main objectives, too, was the establishment of a cultural musicians position in the Cabinet. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3927
Mr. JACKSON. Did the discussions among the musicians in this branch go to the point that music should be of such a nature to carry a message, and should it be of theMr. SCHERER. Wasn't that the next step ? Didn't they have to get a strong organization first, Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. That is what I am trying to determine.
Mr. SCHERER. They didn't get that far so they couldn't advocate the next step.
Mr. CHRISTHEB. That is my interpretation of it.
Mr. SCHERER. That is his interpretation of it.
Mr. JACKSON. I have never been inside the door of a branch meeting, and I daresay I would never be able to get in one. But as between musicians there must have been some discussion of what contribution musicians, as such, could make to the Communist Party.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is undoubtedly true. But, as I said before, I didn't come into it in time to enter into these discussions. I just saw the destructive part of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Mischa Altman play any part in this controversy that arose
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I believe he did, judging from the attitude of the chairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you tell us more definitely what Mischa Altman was endeavoring to accomplish which became the subject of the Musicians Congress?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I can't say specifically with regard to the congress, but I never knew Mischa Altman to not engage in some Marxist analysis of every situation, beginning with the handshake to the final goodby, so I knew it must have taken place here.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you define this controversy a little more clearly, the one that was taken to the section level of the Communist Party? What was that dispute which was presented to the section?
Mr. CHRISTrIEB. It seemed to me it was purely selfish motives. It was divided into perhaps two groups who were vying for the leadership as such, that is, the Communist leadership as such. And it seemed on a very personal level, to me, at all times.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was that connected with the Musicians Congress?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. It didn't very well.
Mr. TAVENNER. You mean this fight for leadership ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. This fight for leadership created considerable vacuum in the congress as such. It is one of the reasons it died.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand you to say that there was a commission appointed on the section level to pass upon these matters.
Mr. SCHERER. He said they had a kangaroo court.
Mr. TAVENNER. Maybe it was a kangaroo court.
Mr. SCHERER. Where they were not allowed to plead the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall who sat on that court or commission?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. It was at the home of a lady, I think, Marion Brooks. The others, other names there, I do not recall from the section as such.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you there?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I was there. 77436-5--pt. 10--- 3928 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
Mr. DoYE. May I interrogate the witness with one question? In view of Mr. Scherer's observation a moment ago that he understood from your testimony that in these kangaroo courts there was no plea of the constitutional privilege. Is that correct?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. That is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. You mean that within the Communist Party procedures where they were undertaking to correct or punish a witness was deprived of his constitutional rights to plead his constitutional privilege?
Mr. SCHERER. He had to answer or else. That has been the testimony all along about these things.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Actually, both sides submitted their testimony in writing, writings which were destroyed immediately afterwards, and no decision was ever handed down, to my knowledge.
Mr. DOYLE. Of course, I know the record will show that we have never had in my time of years on the committee, testimony under oath in any case where the Communist Party ever recognized the constitutional privilege of a member to plead any provision of the United States Constitution. In other words, the testimony universally in the United States before congressional committees is the Communist Party in its own procedures denies the right of an American citizen to plead any provision of the United States Constitution. And if I did not make it clear before my observation I want to say again that I want to compliment the rank and file of the musicians in Los Angeles who have resisted, and still resist, the efforts of the Communist Party in the Los Angeles area to take over and infiltrate and control the musical activities of the professional musicians for the sake of Communist Party doctrine instead of music for music's sake.
Mr. MOULDER. Are you ready, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. How long was it after this disagreement which broke up the Musicians Congress that you left the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I would say within the year, because the congress did fold the first of 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have given us the names of the persons who were instrumental in getting you into the Communist Party and the names of the persons in whose homes the Communist Party met. Will you at this time give us all the names you can recall of the persons who were members of the Communist Party between 1941 and 1946? Before giving us those names, I want to state that in any case in which there is any doubt in your mind we do not want to hear that name. We want you to confine your testimony only to those whom you can positively identify in your own mind as members of the Communist Party at some time during that period.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. All right. Joseph Di Fiore.
Mr. TAVENNER. You may omit those you have already identified.
Mr. MOULDER. What was that name?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That was Di Fiore. I mentioned him before.

Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I don't know where he is now, but I know that he travels.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the basis of your identification of Mr. Saidenberg as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. We met in his home in private meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you meet with him on more than one occasion in his home ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Several times; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall where he lived?
Mr. CHRISTmEB. In Beverly Hills. I don't recall the exact address.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us further identifying information relating to him?
Mr. CHEISTLIEB. No, because he was not in very long. And I say, he did travel considerably. He was always on tour.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether he is now living in the city of New York
Mr. CHEISTLIEB. I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he an instrumentalist?

Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, your reasons for terminating your membership in the Communist Party ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I don't see how anyone can watch any organization fail completely in most of its objectives time after time and year after year and not question its origin, its reason for existence, and its basic principles. And with respect to the union itself, where the party was meant to be active, even the leftwing element moved with each failure further away from the party, left it isolated, so it was reduced to nothing but recruiting and literature and a study society. And to this very day if the word Communist or Commie is used on the union floor, the retching sounds that come out of the members make it sound like a vomitorium. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3931
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you are stating that as far as your particular union is concerned that the Communist Party was ineffective in its efforts to control it?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, sir. I think the formalism charges also brought by the Soviet Government against its composers should bring every musician here to testify.
Mr. SCHERER. I didn't understand that.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. The formalism charges, you will recall, that were brought by the Soviet Government. 
Mr. DOYLE. I did not get the last part of your answer, Witness.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Just reading that alone, musicians everywhere should, particularly here in Los Angeles, be willing to come here and come up and explain that position on that charge. 
Mr. DOYLE. What do you mean by that ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I don't think it is defensible. 
Mr. DOYLE. Tell us more about that? Why should the musicians in Los Angeles worry about any declaration by the Soviet Government in the field of music Why should that worry you ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I think this has affected musicians all over the world. And certainly many musicians in the branch, and here, were asked to explain that position, and rather than explain it, they took the attitude, well, you have a censorship of your own methods of composing through your critic. I think that is rather ridiculous when you consider one to hold a critic against a government.
Mr. SCHERER. That is what Nikolai Khokhlov told us about so ably 2 days ago.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I believe along that same line in individual instances, where I had anything to do with forming chamber groups to play music for the arts and sciences and professions, I was repri- manded by Altman, Mischa Altman, for trying to play music of Stravinsky. 
Mr. SCHERER. You were personally reprimanded?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct.
Mr. SCHERER. What did they say to you at that time ?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. No excuse at that time. This was before formal- ism charges. This was only on the basis that Stravinsky was not being performed at that time.
Mr. SCHERER. Say that again. You were criticized for playing what?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. The music of Stravinsky, Igor Stravinsky.
Mr. SCHERER. For what reason ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. NO reason other than the fact that his music was being ignored in the Soviet Union.
Mr. SCHERER. Being ignored in the Soviet Union.
Mr. JACKSON. Is it good music ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. For me it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Why was it being ignored in the Soviet Union at the time?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. It could have been for very personal reasons. The man has been in this country for a considerable length of time now.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, do I understand thatMr. CHRISTLIEB. As a citizen. 
Mr. DoYLE. According to your testimony, Mr. Altman, one of the heads of the Communist Party cell of the musicians in Los Angeles, 3932 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA and in the Congress of Musicians was telling you that because the music of this Russian composer was frowned upon in Soviet Russia at that time, not to play it in the United States ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. It amounted to that, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. IS that correct?
Mr. CIIRSTLIEB. That is correct. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Khokhlov testified also that that ban in the Soviet Union included Rachmaninoff. Was that also true in your experience?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I didn't know that, sir. 
Mr. JACKSON. But you were told as a musician by a member of the Communist Party and a leader of your branch that such and such a musician's music was out of favor and you should not play it?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Whether you liked it or not?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct. 
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, Mr. Chairman, here is another case in the field of music, which is certainly the universal language, where the Soviet Communist Party was trying to dictate internationalwise what music should be played, and where, even in the United States, only the music should be played which had approval in Soviet Communist Russia. Is that a fair statement, Mr. Witness?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes; it is.
Mr. SCHERER. 1When you were told not to do that, or reprimanded- you could not plead the first amendment either, could you? (Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. CHRISTLIER. That is true.
Mr. SCHERER. Freedom of association and expression.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you any other reasons that you would like to state as to why you left the Communist Party ? 
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was any effort made to get you to rejoin the Com- munist Party after you left?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. On several occasions, not more than 2 or 3, people from the party came to me and asked if I wanted to be in activity again.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were they?
Mr. CnEISTLIEB. Anita Short and Herb Lessner. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Questions, Mr. Doyle? 
Mr. DOYLE. Referring to this Communist Party cell among the musicians, did you testify as to where the cell met and that "they met in my own home"? Is that true?
Mr. CIIRISTLIEB. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. Is that correct?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct. 
Mr. DOYLE. And about how many times did this Communist cell of musicians meet in your home?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Many times, sir. I couldn't begin to guess. 
Mr. DOYLE. Were each and every one of those Communist Party cell meetings in your home known to you to be closed Communist Party meetings ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. That is correct. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3933 
Mr. DOYLE. Then your testimony which you have given is based upon the fact that you had more than just usual knowledge because they met in your own home right under your own roof ?
Mr. CHRISLIEB. That is right.
Mr. DOYLE. And on so many occasions you cannot enumerate them?
Mr. CMIsTLIEB. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOTLE. Is that correct?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. You realize that probably there already are a few people in this room who have started calling you another informer, and criticizing you for coming today and testifying. You realize ? that, don't you
Mr. CIIRISTLIEB. Yes, sir. 
Mr. SCHERER. Let's make it clear. He had no choice either. He was subpenaed.
Mr. DOYLE. I know. But he had the choice of pleading the amendments the same as every other American citizen who isn't in the Communist Party or under their discipline.
Mr. SCHERER. I mean we appreciate his coming and cooperating. But I wanted to point out he ju t didn't come here voluntarily to testify.
Mr. DOYLE. May I make this observation at this point, Mr. Chairman: Here is another case-and there have been 2 or 3 others during these hearings-where men or women, former active Communist Party workers, retiring from the party because they got enough of it, have come forward to help the United States Congress to understand the problem. I want to thank you for it. One more question. I have never met you in my life before. I have never talked with you before. One reason this committee is here is that under Public Law 601, this is a subcommittee of a standing committee of nine of the Congress. Our assignment is to make investigations of the method, manner and extent to which the Communist Party or any other subversive outfit, whether it comes from the Soviet Union or any other place, undertakes to infiltrate and control any group of American citizens for the purpose of overthrowing our Government by force and violence. I don't know what your answer will be. I don't know whether you have thought it through or not. But in these hearings I am primarily interested in trying to find out from you men who have been in the Communist Party, and are patriotic men and have gotten out for good cause, if you have anything to suggest to this committee which we might recommend to the United States Congress for either amending legislation, or new legislation, for handling the question of subversive activities in the United States? Have you any observation to make for our benefit in that field? I realize you are a musician. Maybe you have not been thinking along that line.
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. I think I would not come to the full appreciation of what appearing before this committee has meant to me until I reflect on it later.
Mr. DOYLE. Anticipating that there might be a few here within hearing of our voices, a few outside, and certainly a few Communist 3934 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA inspired papers and publications which will falsely report what has occurred here, charging you immediately with being a paid informer or a stool pigeon, will you state whether or not you have been paid or promised any payment or any inducement or any employment or anything else for testifying as you have today ?
Mr. CHRISTLIEB. No, sir; this was entirely of my own volition.
Mr. DOYE. Thank you.
Mr. SCHERER. And you came as a result of a subpena issued by this committee compelling your attendance ?
Mr. CHRISTLEB. That is correct. 
Mr. MoULDE. Is that all, Mr. Scherer ? 
Mr. SCHERER. That is all. 
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Christlieb, the committee wishes to express to you our sincere appreciation for your cooperation in giving us the information and such facts or knowledge as you have concerning Communist Party activities. We admire your courage and we sincerely appreciate your coming before us and giving us the facts as you know them to be. Thank you very much. The committee will stand in recess until 1: 45 p. m. (Whereupon, at 12: 05 p. m., a recess was taken until 1: 45 p. m., this same day; there being present Representatives Moulder, Doyle, and Scherer.) AFTERNOON SESSION-FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 1956 (The subcommittee was reconvened at 2 p. m., upon the expiration of the recess; present: Representatives Moulder, Doyle, Jackson, and Scherer.)
Mr. MOULDER. The committee will be in order. Will you call your next witness, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Idriss. Will you come forward, please, sir?
Mr. MOULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear the testimony which you are about to give the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. IDRISS. Yes. TESTIMONY OF RAMEZ IDRISS
