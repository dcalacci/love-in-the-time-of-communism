Mr. LUSTGARTEN. I decline to testify on the grounds of the fifth amendment of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you assist in any manner in recruiting persons to that Communist Party organization?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. I will have to give the same answer to that, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. For the same reason?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. For the same reason.
Mr. MOULDER. You mean you decline to answer for the same reasons ?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. Yes. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Musicians Branch of the Communist Party during that part of 1945 when you were in Los Angeles?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. Well, I was in the Army in 1945.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated that you were here 5 months in 1945 before going to St. Louis.
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. I think the record will show that that was in 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. In 1946?

Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the time you were stationed in that vicinity, and while in the Armed Forces?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. I refuse to testify for the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say the 5 months of time that you were in this area was in 1946, I thought you meant 1945. Were you a member of the Musicians Branch of the Communist Party during that period in 1946?

Mr. LUSTGARTEN. The same grounds, the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. You refuse to answer?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle? 3942 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask you the same question I asked the witness just ahead of you, whether or not there is any reservation or limitation on today as to whether or not you have any obligations, directly or indirectly, moral or otherwise, to be a member of the Communist Party at any future date, tomorrow, or a week from tomorrow, or a year from tomorrow? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. I have no intention of becoming a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. I want to compliment you. At this point, Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact that this witness and so many witnesses have pleaded constitutional privileges, the 1st and 5th amendments, may I read one short paragraph from a brief filed in the Supreme Court of the United States by the American Bar Association. Certainly we lawyer members of the committee, and the lawyers who appear in this hearing room with these witnesses, should take a good deal of stock in what the American Bar Association files with the Supreme Court. May I just read this at this point? I think it is important that we get it in the record. I read from page 7, and this is in the case of Communist Party of the United States of America, Petitioner,v. Subversive Activities Control Board: The Communist Party-petitioners' contention that the act violates its freedom of speech under the first amendment is without merit. Section 1 of the act eliminates any basis for such argument. By no sane or sound construction of the act can it be deemed to control freedom of thought or of speech or to apply to radical espousal or radical organizations unless they result from foreign domination of the Communist movement. No organization and no individual-however radical but not so dominated-is encompassed by this act. Nor is any person or organization prevented from advocating any change, however far reaching, however unsound, however obnoxious, through change in our Constitution. Article V of the Constitution provides one of the greatest of all rightspossibly even the greatest-that of the people to effect any change in our Government by the adoption of appropriate amendment to the Constitution. Orderly change in the Government by choice of the people is not one of the basic concepts of communism, which espouses rather subversion and violent resolution. In no country that communism dominates has it achieved power by the free choice of its people-not even in Russia. 
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Jackson ?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. Call the next witness, please, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Morris Boltuch.
Mr. MOULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. BOLTUCt. I do. 
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner. TESTIMONY OF MORRIS BOLTUCH, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, DANIEL G. MARSHALL
