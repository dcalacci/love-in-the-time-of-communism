Mr. DIFIORE. Mr. Tavenner and members of this committee, I do not think that this committee has the right to inquire into my private beliefs and associations and therefore I must decline to answer on constitutional grounds, including the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any personal knowledge of a plan by the Communist Party to use its members who were musicians to circulate petitions in Los Angeles to place the Independent Progressive Party on the ballot in 1948 ?
Mr. DiFioRE. Again I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a document marked for identification as "DiFiore Exhibit No. 1." It is a photostatic copy of an Independent Progressive Party petition bearing date of January 31, 1948, at the end of which, is an affidavit over the name of Joseph DiFiore. Will you examine that, please, and state whether or not the name appearing at the bottom of the affidavit is your name and whether it is your signature? (Document handed to the witness and his counsel.) (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. DiFiORE. I shall decline to identify any signature on any document that you may present me on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence and ask that it be marked "Joseph DiFiore Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. MOTLDER. Without any objection, it is so admitted. (This exhibit is similar to "Kalman Bloch Exhibit No. 1", p. 3957 and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.) SMr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, this affidavit, as the others, shows that the individual named, Joseph DiFiore, circulated the petition and obtained the signatures thereon. Are you now a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. DIFIORE. Again I must say that you have no right to inquire into my beliefs and associations. But I will state that I am not a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the time that the subpena was served on you to appear before this committee ?
Mr. DIFIORE. I must invoke the same amendments, the first and fifth. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. DIFiORE. I must decline to answer on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the beginning of this hearing which was on Monday of this week, today being Friday
Mr. DiFioRE. I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party yesterday ?
Mr. DIFIORE. I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it just Fridays that you are not a member of the Communist Party ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3939 
Mr. DFIRE. I decline to answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. DIFIORE. On the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle ?
Mr. DOYLE. I think in connection with the witness' testimony that we have no right to inquire, I want to read one short paragraph from the decision of Quinn v. United States, which is a recent decision of May 23 1955. The Supreme Court said, and I quote: There can be no doubt as to the power of Congress, by itself or through its committees, to investigate matters and conditions relating to contemplated legislation. This power, deeply rooted in American and English institutions, is indeed coextensive with the power to legislate. Without the power to investigate-including of course the authority to compel testimony, either through its own processes or through judicial trial-Congress could be seriously handicapped in its efforts to exercise its constitutional function wisely and effectively. May I say to the witness, in view of your answer that you are not now a member of the Communist Party, I don't mean to impute any lack of good faith on your part: But may I ask so as to clear it in my own mind and on the record, are you in any way today, which is the day you said you are not a member of the Communist Party, in any relationship directly or indirectly to again be a member of the Communist Party at some future date. Or are you completely free from any conscious awareness of being in any way tied up with the Communist Party philosophy ? Is that a fair question ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. DIFiORE. Mr. Doyle, I have no intention of joining the Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. I want to compliment you.
Mr. MOULDER. Is that all, Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. That is all.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. I have no questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. NO questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Edgar Lustgarten.
Mr. MOULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn, please. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. LUSTGARTEN. I do.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner. TESTIMONY OF EDGAR LUSTGARTEN, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, EDMUND W. COOKE
