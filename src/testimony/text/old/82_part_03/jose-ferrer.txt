Mr. FERRER. Jose Ferrer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented here by counsel?
Mr. FERRER. I am, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel please identify themselves for the record ?
Mr. FORTAS. I am Abe Fortas, of the firm of Arnold, Fortas & Porter, Ring Building, Washington, D. C., representing Mr. Ferrer.
Mr. REISKIND. I am Edwin Reiskind, New York City, attorney for
Mr. Ferrer. 533 534 INDUSTRY 
Mr. WOOD. What is your office address, please?
Mr. REISKIND. 1270 Sixth Avenue. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Ferrer, will you state briefly for the committee what your educational training has been ?
Mr. FERRER. Most of my education took place, through high school, in New York City. I went to various schools, and I only went to school in Puerto Rico 2 years, first and second years of high school.
Mr. WooD. May I ask that you speak a little louder? hear you up here.
Mr. FERRER. Righto. We can't Most of my education up to college, that is through high school, took place in New York City. The first and second years of high school, I went to school in Puerto Rico. When I graduated from high school I spent a year preparing for my college-entrance examination. I went abroad, to Switzerland, for a year, then entered Princeton in the fall of 1928 as a member of the class of 1932. I did not graduate in 1932, but did graduate in 1933. I majored in architecture. In 1933 I decided to change my profession, and did an additional year's work at Princeton in modern languages. Then from 1934 to 1935 I studied at Columbia University with the intention of getting a master's degree in modern languages. I completed all the requirements for this degree except that of writing my thesis, the reason for not writing my thesis being that in June 1935 I decided to go into the theater professionally.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you outline briefly to the committee what your experience has been after entering the profession of acting? (Representative Morgan M. Moulder entered hearing room.)
Mr. FERRER. Well, to make it brief, from 1935 to the present time I have been connected with 24 Broadway productions; I have done about 70 weeks of stock; and I have been in 4 motion pictures. Would you care for any names, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. Suppose you name three or four of the principal Broadway productions with which you have been associated.
Mr. FERRER. The ones that might be best known to the general public, sir, would be Brother Rat, Charlie's Aunt- 
Mr. TAVENNER. Both of those were also adapted to the movies ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes; they were.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you take part in the movie productions ?
Mr. FERRER. NO; I did not. The Theatre Guild's production of Othello; Cyrano de Bergerac on the stage; The Silver Whistle; and now Twentieth Century with Miss Swanson. (Representative Francis E. Walter entered hearing room.) 
Mr. TAVENNER. Now if you will state the main screen productions.
Mr. FERRER. There were four. The first was Joan of Arc, starring Ingrid Bergman. The second was Whirlpool, starring Gene Tierney. The third was Crisis, starring Cary Grant. And the fourth was Cyrano de Bergerac.
Mr. TAVENNER. What about the picture Strange Fruit ?
Mr. FERRER. That has never been made on film.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is a stage production? 
Mr. FmRRER. Yes. I produced and directed it but did not play in it. I didn't mention it because it was not very much of a success. It only ran a few weeks.  INDUSTrRY 535 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state the period of time during which you were engaged as an actor in screen productions? What was the date of your first engagement as an actor ?
Mr. FERRER. I am trying to remember if it was 1947 or 1948. I think it was 1947, September of 1947. I was engaged for a period of 3 weeks in Joan of Arc. Whirlpool was in 1949, the months of June and July. Crisis was in 1950, the months of January and February. And Cyrano was in 1950, the month of July.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you in Hollywood on each of the occasions you have listed ?
Mr. FERRER. Generally speaking, Mr. Tavenner, it has been my practice to leave Hollywood as soon as the picture is terminated. There are two exceptions. In every case I arrived just in time to start work. After Joan of Arc I remained in Hollywood for approximately 4 weeks beyond the term of by contract.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you not have to be in Hollywood for a period of time prior to the actual production of the picture?
Mr. FERRER. NO, sir. As a matter of fact, when I arrived in Hollywood for Joan of Arc they had already begun shooting. That was a vast production, 4 months, and I only worked 3 weeks. For Whirlpool I arrived just before they began shooting and left right after. risis, I stayed afterward because we began preparatory work for Cyrano de Bergerac. I worked on Cyrano for 3 or 4 months before the'actual shooting began, because having produced as well as played in the Broadway production, they felt I could be useful to them in the capacity of a technical adviser on the film.
Mr. TAVENNER. What periods did you spend in Hollywood in addi- tion to those you have described ? 
Mr. FERRER. 1 was in Los Angeles, living in downtown Los Angeles, for 3 weeks when Othello played in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was in 1943, was it not ?
Mr. FERRER. 1945, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. 1945 ? 
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir, in January 1945. I was in Hollywood for 4 weeks during the summer of 1939 under contract to RKO, a contract which resulted in no work. At the end of 4 weeks we called it off by mutual consent. I was in Hollywood on several occasions 'during 1950 for a day or two or a week at a time, when I was doing a national publicity junket for Cyrano. I traveled all over the country and appeared in about a dozen cities, spoke on Cyrano, and during the course of this junket had occasion to return to California on several occasions.
Mr. WOOD. Again may I suggest that you talk a little louder.
Mr. FERRER. I am sorry, sir. I thought this [indicating loud- speaker] was serving some purpose. Apparently it isn't. I will speak louder.
Mr. TAVENNER. Had you completed your answer?
Mr. FERRER. I was just going to say, Mr. Tavenner, which may be a gratuitous remark on my part, that my stay in Los Angeles has always been as a transient. I have never lived there or considered it my residence.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Ferrer, after the service of a subpena on you, the committee reecived a letter from you, through counsel, in which you stated: 536 I attest and will so swear under oath that I am not, have never been, could not be, a member of the Communist Party, nor, specifically, am I a sympathizer with any Communist aim, a fellow traveler, or in any way an encourager of any Communist Party concept or objective. Is that substantially your statement?
Mr. FERRER. I assume it is, Mr. Tavenner. In any event, that defi- nitely reflects my views.
Mr. TAVENNER. The reason I read it to you is it appeared in the letter as a quotation, and therefore I assumed it was your statement.
Mr. FERRER. Yes. I now have a copy of the letter. Yes, it is accurate.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. I am not now nor have I ever been.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you ever been a sympathizer ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Paraphrasing the language of your statement, have you been a sympathizer with any Communist aim, or have you been a fellow traveler, or in any way an encourager of any Communist Party concept or objective?
Mr. FERRER. The only time I could even remotely be said to have been in sympathy with any Communist aim was when it coincided with the aim of our Government. For instance, when they wanted us to win the last war, I certainly was' in sympathy with that; but in the sense you indicate, I never was.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee is in possession of information indicating your affiliation or connection with quite a number of organizations which have from time to time been cited by various governmental agencies as Communist-front organizations. You, of course,. are aware that affiliations with or activities in Communist-front organizations, if true and unexplained, leave the implication that one is in fact a member of the Communist Party or has been, or that he is in fact a sympathizer of the Communist Party or an encourager of Communist Party concepts and objectives. You agree with that, do you not?
Mr. FERRER. Yes. This has been made dramatically clear to me recently, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. The'committee is quite concerned about the use of Communist fronts in exploiting the objectives of the Communist Party, and that is particularly true with regard to Hollywood, which is only one phase of the entertainment field.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. A witness who appeared here before this committee last week, Mr. Roy M. Brewer, whose position with a labor union in Hollywood over a long period of time has put him in a position of having special knowledge on this subject, states that the real power that they [the Communists] had in Hollywood was through their front organizations. He also testified at some length regarding the Communist fronts in Hollywood. This may in one way or another be true as to all the entertainment fields. At least, it applies to Hollywood.  INDUSTRY 537 
Mr. Brewer testified as follows, on page 131 of the transcript: * * * The Communist fronts played a very important part in publicizing the class struggle and publicizing their efforts to infiltrate and take control of all trade-union activities which they felt would promote the philosophy of their party. But in this Hollywood situation the fronts played an even more important part in this control of the thought of the community, which certainly followed over into the unions and made it very difficult for those of us who were trying to expose the Communist nature of this thing to get that idea across. During this period the fronts played a very important part in controlling the thought of the community, which I testified to yesterday. This was really the instrument by which they got all these people, most of whom were honest, sincere people who wanted to do the right thing, who wanted to serve humanity in a practical way, and wound up finding themselves in an organization that had been manipulated by the Communist Party day after day, week after week, and month after month. That illustrates what has been testified to here as to the importance of Communist-front activities in the entertainment field. Now, the committee desires to ask you a number of questions relating to your own special knowledge of Communist fronts in Hollywood, not only for the purpose of finding what your own connection with those organizations was, but to ascertain the manner in which your assistance was secured, if that be true, and the method by which these organizations function. So, I will start off asking you about various Communist-front organizations with which we have information that you have at one time or another been connected. First of all, do you have any comment to make upon the testimony of Mr. Brewer 'that I have just read to you about the importance of Communist-front activities in, let us say, the broader field of entertainment, unless you desire to confine it to the Hollywood area particularly?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner, my comment would have to be in the broader field, because I don't know enough about any organized activity in Hollywood. I have never belonged to any committee or group in Hollywood of any sort whatever except the Screen Actors' Guild. Regarding the broader phases of the entertainment field, I would say that undoubtedly what Mr. Brewer says probably is very perceptive and very accurate, not only as regards Communist-front activities, but also, very importantly from my personal point of view, the way innocent and well-intentioned people have been deceived and lured into participation in causes which at one time seemed worthy and later on appeared unworthy. Any comment, I say, I would have to make on Mr. Brewer's testimony, would have to apply to the broader field and not to Hollywood specifically.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have anything else you desired to say ?
Mr. FFRRER. No, sir. Thank you. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have before me .a pamphlet entitled "Artists' Front to Win the War," published by that organization October 16, 1942. It reflects that you are one of the sponsors of the theater section of that organization. Were you affiliated with it in any way ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner, may I see the pamphlet ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 1 See pp. 518 and 519, pt. 2, of hearings printed under this title. 538 INDUSTRY 
Mr. FERRER. And to explain my request to see it, I would like to tell you that my memory in these matters is controlled largely by association. If I can see where a function took place and who was there, then I am able to tell you accurately my participation.
Mr. TAVENNER. We will be glad to refresh your recollection as far as we can. 
Mr. FERRER. Thank you. [After examining document:] I have no recollection of this whatever, Mr. Tavenner. It is entirely possible, and even probable, that the listing of my name is legitimate. and that I did authorize it, but I do not have any recollection of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. This pamphlet, under date October 16, 1942, has a heading, as you noticed, in the center of the pamphlet, For a Second Front This Year. You do recall, do you not, that that was the Communist Party line during that period in 1942, to urge the establishment of a second front, and that the Communist Party went all out to establish that line ?
Mr. FERRER. I recall that in the light of later knowledge. I did not know at the time that it was the Communist Party line.
Mr. MOULDER. A second front in what?
Mr. TAVENNER. In World War II. That is correct, isn't it?
Mr. FERRER. I think so.
Mr. TAVENNER. In fact, that is the only purpose shown for the establishment of this organization, Artists' Front to Win the War?
Mr. FERRER. Would you like me to explain why I probably allowed my name to be used ? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. FERRER. Looking over the names of the sponsors, the general technique is to come to someone, by letter or otherwise, and say, "You realize that a second front must be established." And to make yourself appear to be a person of some sagacity, you say, "Yes." Then they say, "Important people are ready to move in that direction," and they show you a list of distinguished names, leaders in cultural and various fields, names you associate with integrity and authority, and if it seems a worth-while cause-and I am speaking only for myself-you say, "Certainly, use my name."
Mr. TAVENNER. And you were one of the distinguished persons in the field of actors ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't think I was very distinguished in 1942, Mr. Tavenner. There is a question whether I am distinguished now.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall who solicited your affiliation with this organization ?
Mr. FERRER. No; I don't. I have no knowledge of this organization at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do recall that sometime later this organization was cited as a Communist front by the Committee on Un-American Activities and the California committee; do you not?
Mr. FERRER. I recall it in the light of the work and the research that I have done recently; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. There was a committee known as the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born. The committee possesses information indicating that your name was listed as the sponsor of a dinner given by the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born held April 17, 1943, at the Hotel Biltmore in New York City. Do you recall sponsoring that dinner and attending it?  INDUSTRY 539 
Mr. FERRER. I am pretty sure I did not attend it, Mr. Tavenner, and I will say I think I remember sponsoring it simply because it has been proven to me time and again, especially in the last few weeks, that one's memory can be treacherous, especially about things which, although undoubtedly important, are peripheral to one's activities. Were you to ask me about the theater, I would recall even if it was a long time ago, but this kind of thing, I do not devote most of my thought to it, and I can't say I remember or don't because I am not sure what I do remember. I am sure my name was used legitimately in this connection. I am reasonably certain, because of the people connected with this dinner, that I authorized the use of my name, but I must be tentative in my answer if I am to be entirely truthful, which I am trying to be.
Mr. TAVENNER. What association did you have with the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, if any ? 
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember any connection whatever. What probably happened, again, is that I received a letter saying: "We are having this dinner; will you lend us your name?" Then they cited some distinguished names connected with the dinner. I don't remember who they were, but wasn't Mrs. Roosevelt's name and other names used in soliciting sponsors ? 
Mr. TAVENNER. There were the names of a number of people. I do not see the name you mentioned. sponsors. I am handing you the list of 
Mr. FERRER (examining list). Dorothy Thompson, William Allen White, and Edward G. Robinson were among the people who spoke at that dinner. In connection with the foreign-born, Mr. Tavenner, I would say that I would probably be predisposed emotionally to help the foreignborn in any legitimate cause in this country, because of the fact that I am a Puerto Rican, that I was born in Puerto Rico, that I was born an American citizen in Puerto Rico, as all Puerto Ricans are, and I am deeply aware of the fact that although I myself have always been treated admirably in this country, I have many Puerto Rican friends, and there are many I don't know, who are treated as foreigners in this country and as people who are unwanted. I am extremely sympathetic to their problems and do all I can to alleviate them. Therefore, an organization to help the foreign-born would have an immediate appeal to my emotions.
Mr. TAVENNER. But are you familiar with the extent to which the Communist Party has endeavored to infiltrate organizations that may be interested in that cause ?
Mr. FERRER. Unfortunately, I have become aware only in recent months.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know that this organization has been cited as subversive?
Mr. FERRER. I know that now.
Mr. TAVENNER. By this committee and also by the California com- mittee. I want to ask you questions now concerning the Joint AntiFascist Refugee Committee. The December 21, 1943, issue of New Masses, at page 31, contains an advertisement indicating that Jos6 Ferrer, among others, was to be an entertainer at an all-star show to be held on January 26, 1944, at the Imperial Theater in New York 540 INDUSTRY under the auspices of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Did you appear as an entertainer on that occasion ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I did not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you explain to the committee how your name happened to appear in the advertisement?
Mr. FERRER. I think what probably happened is that they came to me and said, "Will you appear?" and I agreed to appear because, as I remember, Jimmy Durante, Milton Berle, and other people prominent in show business were going to appear. The reason I didn't appear is probably because an actor such as I am as not qualified to entertain at this kind of a benefit. When a man can sing a song or tell stories or make jokes or tap dance, he is qualified to go out and entertain 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 minutes with an act. An actor is, as a rule, in a play which begins about 8: 30 or 8: 45 and ends at 11, and he works with other actors in a carefully designed entertainment program. What we usually do when called upon to appear at benefits is either to introduce entertainers or to say, "I am very happy to be here, greetings, and good night," and get away as gracefully as possible until Ray Bolger comes. What probably happened is that I got cold feet and ducked, because I knew if I appeared I would be somewhat of a lull in the program. But I did agree to appear and just didn't.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were more or less active, were you not, with this organization, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee?
Mr. FERRER. I was from time to time; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you make contributions to it?
Mr. FERRER. I don't believe so. If I may ask counsel, they would be able to tell you better than I can. (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. FERRER (continuing). They are of the opinion I did not.
Mr. FORTAS. We have a list, Mr. Tavenner, of all contributions Mr. Ferrer made to any cause so far as they can be ascertained from his own records, and will be glad to supply that if you want it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you take a hurried glance at the list and see if you have made contributions to this organization ? 
Mr. FERRER. I suspect they will take careful glances.
Mr. FORTAS. Would you like to have a copy, Mr. Tavenner? (Copy of document was handed to Mr. Tavenner.) 
Mr. WOOD. May 1 inquire if there are extra copies of the list avail- able for the members of the committee ? 
Mr. FORTAS. Yes, sir [handing copies to members of committee].
Mr. TAVENNER. I have looked at the list, and I do not see any con- tributions to this organization. Does that mean that you did not make any contributions as far as you know ?
Mr. FERRER. As far as I know, Mr. Tavenner. Any contribution I would have made I would have made by check, and this list is made from a thorough search of my check books.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you engage in other activities with regard to the raising of money or benefits for what was known as the Spanish Refugee Appeal? 
Mr. FERRER: I think I probably did, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were acquainted with the fact that the Spanish Refugee Appeal was one of the projects of the organization with  541 which you -ay you were connected, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee? 
Mr. FERRER. I am aware now. Whether I was then, I am not sure. I certainly linked them together in my mind. I am not trying to evade your question.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee is in possession of information in- dicating you were the guest of honor at a meeting sponsored by the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee in San Francisco on March 10, 1945. Do you recall that?
Mr. FERRER. If it is the one at which Walter Huston spoke, then I do recall it; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us about that meeting. What was the purpose of it ?
Mr. FERRER. My memory is vague on that subject. I suspect the purpose was, so far as I knew and so far as Mr. Huston's speech indicated, which is what I remember about the meeting, action against Franco. We who. called ourselves liberal Democrats considered France a dictator, a man who was against the democratic processes, as Hitler had been and as Stalin is today, and anytime there was an occasion to oppose him I, for one, rather unquestioningly did so.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee is in possession of information that you spoke at a Spanish Refugee Appealbenefit held for the purpose of raising funds on May 5, 1945, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., which was sponsored by the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. Do you recall that ?
Mr. FERRER. I think I do. I know I spoke.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us what the arrangements were by which you were to appear at these various meetings, and whether it was a series of meetings that you attended.
Mr. FERRER. No. During the season 1944 to 1945 I was on tour with Othello, and what would happen, as in San Francisco or Madison, would be that we would be playing in San Francisco, and in the case of Madison we were playing in Chicago, and Madison is only 3 hours away, and I was asked would I appear and speak, and I agreed to, my sole thought being anti-Franco activity.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was any arrangement made prior to your leaving on this tour with Othello for you to appear in behalf of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee at various places ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't think any definite arrangements were made, 
Mr. Tavenner. I seem to recall having been told that from time to time, if the schedule coincided, they might contact me and that I would be asked to speak, and I said I would.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who guided and directed that course of procedure? In other words, who made the suggestion to you and the arrangements?
Mr. FERRER. Gosh, I wish I could remember, Mr. Tavenner. Very often these things came in a phone call, and I don't remember specifically any persons or name because, strange as it seems, I would get a letter or phone call and be asked to appear and I would say "Yes," and I would appear and that would be the end of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were rather active, I take it, in connection with the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, over a considerable period of time ? 542 INDUSTRY 
Mr. FERRER. Active only in appearing at public functions. I never appeared at private meetings or anything of that sort. My only activities were in connection with public functions.
Mr. TAVENNER. We find, for instance, in the issue of the Daily Worker of September 25, 1945, an article listing you as a speaker before a group of 17,000 persons at Madison Square Garden on September 24, 1945, as a function held under the auspices of the Spanish Refugee Appeal. Were you a speaker on that occasion ?
Mr. FERRER. I think I introduced Paula Lawrence, Josh White, and the CIO chorus. That was my function during the evening I acted as master of ceremonies, if that is the occasion. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The article mentions that, so I guess that is the meeting. SMr. FERRER. I think that is the night Mr. Laski spoke from Eng- land.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. He is chairman of the English Labor Party.
Mr. FERRER. And made remarks supposed to be derogatory to the Caltholic Church, and Frank FayMr. TAVENNER. This is another meeting?
Mr. FERRER. This is the meeting which provoked Frank Pay,
Mr. TAVENNER. And at that same meeting Dr. Edward K. Barsky, chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, spoke and made a special appeal for funds for the Spanish cause?
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember that.
Mr. TAVENNER. And at the same meeting Mr. Nikolai Novikov, acting head of the Russian Embassy, was a speaker and called for the prosecution of Franco as a war criminal. Do you recall that?
Mr. FERRER. No. I don't know if you have ever attended any of the meetings at the Garden, but I can give you my view of what happened.
Mr. TAVENNER. Any explanation you wish to make.
Mr. FERRER. Say a meeting is scheduled for 7:30. They would say, "We want you to introduce some of the speakers." I would say, "I am engaged in a production on Broadway," which I was at that time-I was working on Strange Fruit-and I would say, "If you will submit the material you want me to use, and write the introductions, I will be there at that time, and as soon as I am through I will leave." If they say, "We want you at 9:30," I arrive at 9:30. The activity i- taking place on an elevated platform, something like a prize fighting ring. Around the bottom of this arena is a tremendous hustle and bustle of newspaper people, photographers, people coming and going, and one very seldom listens to what is happening on the stage, because one is busy preparing one's own material, and when he is through, he leaves. I remember a Spanish lady, Isabel de Palencia, was there. I was introduced to her. I remember Paula Lawrence and Josh White, and that is all I remember of that meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. You made mention of the fact that there was a later meeting held criticizing this particular meeting?
Mr. FERRER. It was charged, was it not, that this meeting sponsored by the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee was a Communistinspired program that was being conducted there; you recall that?
Mr. FERRER. Yes; I do, sir.  INDUSTRY 543 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you make any investigation to determine,for yourself whether there was any substance to that charge, whether or not this organization, of which you were a member and in which you had been very active, was tainted with communism?
Mr. MOULDER. What year was that? 
Mr. FERRER. 1945, September, I believe. Tavenner? 
Mr. Is that right, Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. FERRER. I did not, sir. I regret to say that I didn't, and one reason I may not have was that the charges of communism against his meeting and against this organization at that time were made by Frank Fay, who, although he turns out to have been factually right in regard to this meeting, behaved in such a scandalous and ill-advised manner throughout that charges were brought against him by his own union. I was then on the council at Equity, and I know. Mr. Fay to be a man of excessive conduct, a man who automatically, if you are a decent and fair-mined person, throws you into an opposite point of view. I mean this very sincerely, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Wouldn't it have been a warning? Wasn't it a flag in your face ?
Mr. FERRER. I admit I was wrong, and take all the blame for not listening, but I would like to explain that listening to Mr. Frank Fay is something that doesn't come easily to me.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you become connected with this organi- zation, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner, my connection with the organization was that they would call me up and say, "Will you appear?" and I would say "Yes." I never was in any way connected with them in the sense that I worked with them, except to agree to appear at rallies and meetings, and on those occasions either I would be approached by phone or by letter, depending on the importance of the occasion.
Mr. VELDE. Do you remember any of the names of persons who called you ? 
Mr. FERRER. I do not, Mr. Velde. Mr. Tavenner asked me a while ago if I remembered, and I tried to think of some names, but you must believe me when I say I am not trying to avoid the question. I can't remember or think of a name or a face in connection with this matter.
Mr. TAVENNER. This meeting to which we referred was September 24, 1945, as to which we spoke of the flag which should have notified you of the Communist Party purposes of this organization. The .Special Committee on Un-American Activities cited this organization on March 29,,1944, more than a year prior to that. Weren't you aware of the fact at that time, in September 1945, that the Communist Party infiltration into that organization was a publicly known charge?
Mr. FERRER. I don't believe I was, Mr. Tavenner. I should like to explain something else about appearing at this sort of meeting. Before any member of an actors' or entertainment union is allowed to appear at any function and lend his services, he has to check with an organization known as Theater Authority, the chairman of which was Alan Corelli. If they say, "Do not appear," you do not appear, because if you do appear against their instructions, Equity, my union, takes a very, very serious view of it. 544 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY Theater Authority was established by Equity, Screen Actors' Guild, and other unions. I can only say, to explain my answer, that there were people in the organization whom I considered not subversive, including the CIO chorus, and because of that fact, plus the fact Theater Authority gave me permission to go ahead, I did appear.
Mr. TAVENNER. You did secure authority on that occasion ?
Mr. FERRER. I would have to.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was in charge of Theater Authority in September 1945 ? \Mr. FERRER. Alan Corelli has been in charge for many, many years until just recently.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it brought to your attention through any source that this committee had cited that organization ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know if it was or not, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you first learn it?
Mr. FERRER. I suspect that I first learned it recently, when I had to do a lot of studying that I probably should have done long ago. 
Mr. WooD. Is that your best recollection ?
Mr. FERRER. That is my best recollection.
Mr. WALTER. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ferrer, aren't artists such as you required to make certain appearances other than theatrical appearances ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. We are not required to do anything.
Mr. WALTER. A witness testified before the committee sometime ago that, under a contract she had, she was required to make public appearances wherever her manager said she was to appear.
Mr. FERRER. -That is a special arrangement she had with her manager, but it is not a typical arrangement, Mr. Walter. Of course we do have the habit of appearing whenever we can for what appear to be worthy causes, but there is no obligation to do so.
Mr. WOOD. Do I understand you to say that you have no choice about where you appear ?
Mr. FERRER. No, Mr. Wood. You misunderstood me. I have the choice. That is what I was telling Mr. Walter. I cannot be forced to appear but I can be prevented from appearing; yes. 
Mr. WooD. Are the organizations or meetings at which you do appear selected for you, or do you exercise some choice about it yourself?
Mr. FERRER. This body, Theater Authority, when you are asked to appear at a function, if you decide that you want to appearMr. WOOD. Then you have to clear it with them ?
Mr. FERRER. That is right.
Mr. WOOD. And if they turn thumbs down you can't appear?
Mr. FERRER. You cannot appear.
Mr. WooD. Can they require you to appear?
Mr. FERRER. No.
Mr. WOOD. So your appearance is voluntary?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. WooD. And it was in this instance?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WooD. It was not compulsory ?
Mr. FERRER. It was not compulsory. I take full blame. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE 545 INDUSTRY 
Mr. WooD. And you have the privilege of making a full investiga- tion of the organizations that ask you to appear, before you appear?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WooD. And you had that privilege in this instance ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. WOOD. And in this instance you did not make such investiga- tion?
Mr. FERRER. I did not make the investigation I should have. I can only say that in the future I will.
Mr. DoyiE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question ?
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle. 
Mr. DOYlE. Is it one of the functions of Theater Authority to be a clearing-house as to whether the event is a proper event? In other words, if they would have knowledge that it was Communist infiltrated, should they have told you to stay away from that event ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Doyle. I know that I was told, when I joined Actors' Equity Association, that during the period of years when excesses occurred and actors were requested to appear for anything and everything, Theater Authority was established to protect them. What screening they do, I do not know.
Mr. DoYE. You don't know what their rules or bylaws are, or what investigation they make of events, or knowledge they have of events?
Mr. FERRER. I do not.
Mr. DOYLE. Is Theater Authority still in existence?
Mr. FERRER. I think it is, Mr. Doyle. 
Mr. WooD. Does it still screen the organizations at which actors are asked to appear ?
Mr. FERRER. I believe it does.
Mr. WooD. Do you still belong to it ?
Mr. FERRER. Theater Authority ?
Mr. WooD. Yes.
Mr. FERRER. People don't belong to it.
Mr. WooD. Are you still under its jurisdiction?
Mr. FERRER. Yes; as long as I am a member of Actors' Equity Association, I am under its jurisdiction. 
Mr. KEARNEY. Who is head of Theater Authority ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know who is now. Alan Corelli was for many years. He no longer is. 
Mr. DOYLE. Do they have offices in different parts of the country?
Mr. FERRER. I only know of the office they used to have on Fifth Avenue in New York.
Mr. DOLE. Did they ever tell you in writing whether you should appear? Did they ever send you a written letter telling you not to appear?
Mr. FERRER. NO; I was never told not to appear. Every function I was asked to appear at, they 0. K.'d. However, time after time I have seen Mr. Corelli at the functions. He was extremely busy, but was almost always there whenever I was at these functions.
Mr. DOYLE. These occasions at which you spoke or introduced persons who spoke, I take it were money-raising events, most of them?
Mr. FERRER. Certainly a great proportion were. 
Mr. DOYLE. Then I would infer that part of the reason for the existence of Theater Authority would be to, as far as they could, 81595-51-pt. 3-2 546 INDUSTRY protect you actors from being imposed upon by being asked to appear at events which in fact were not charitable. Is that correct ?
Mr. FERRER. I would think so.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you have that understanding at that time, that that was the function of Theater Authority ?
Mr. FERRER. I am sure it is one of the functions, but I cannot answer your other question as to whether their authority extended beyond that.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. WOOD. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there any occasion on which Theater Au- thority denied you permission to appear at a function on the ground that it was under Communist influence and control, or was a Communist organization?
Mr. FERRER Not that I remember, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. These various instances when you participated in activities of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, were you always called by the same individual or by different individuals?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know, Mr. Tavenner, because, as I told Mr. Velde, I have no recollection of an individual. Sometimes I was approached by phone; sometimes I was approached by letter. I don't remember an individual.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there any occasions when you recall that you were called by persons who were members of organizations other than the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, asking that you participate in one of these affairs ?
Mr. FERRER. You mean someone who was not a member of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, but who might be interested from an entirely different angle.
Mr. FERRER. Not that I know of, Mr. Tavenner; not that I know of. May I say one more thing, Mr. Tavenner ? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. FERRER. I am scratching around the back of my head trying to discover why these requests for my appearance are so anonymous in my memory, and one reason I may submit is the fact that I don't go to my office very often. My office where I produce from receives my mail, my secretary opens my mail, and messages are often transmitted to me by phone, and sometimes I may have gotten invitations to appear second or third-hand, and I would say "Call and say 'yes'."
Mr. TAVENNER. This organization known as Theater Authority screened and passed upon the public appearances you could make? 
Mr. FERRER. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did they also screen and pass upon the organizations you were permitted to sponsor ?
Mr. FERRER. Oh, no, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. So organizations you sponsored were entirely upon your own initiative ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. A voluntary act without any restrictions of any sort ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to ask you now about-  INDUSTRY 547 
Mr. FERRER. Excuse me. Their jurisdiction extends to a professional appearance. When I act as an individual, they have nothing to say about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you consider that your appearance at this meeting of September 24, 1945, was a professional appearance or a personal appearance?
Mr. FERRER. It was professional in the sense that they published my name, and my name was linked with others who were going to perform.
Mr. TAVENNER. If you had been advertised without the word "actor" after your name, would that mean you were appearing in a personal and not a professional capacity ?
Mr. FERRER. No. If they promise you a show, and your name is listed as an individual appearing for many people to look at and listen to, then that is a professional appearance.
Mr. TAVENNER. But if you were to take part in a public meeting to argue a question in which the meeting was interested, that would be a personal appearance?
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. As distinguished from a professional appearance?
Mr. FERRER. It is my understanding that is the fact.
Mr. TAVENNER. The American Committee for Spanish Freedom was an organization formed after the civil war in Spain. According to a letterhead of the American Committee for Spanish Freedom bearing date January 21, 1946, you are named as one of the sponsors of this organization. Will you please explain to the committee what motivated you in becoming a sponsor of that organization, if you did, :and how your sponsorship was obtained ? (Representative Donald L. Jackson left hearing room.)
Mr. FERRER. I do not remember this specific organization, Mr. Tavenner. However, once more I must plead guilty to the charge of carelessness. If I was approached on an anti-Franco question, the chance is I would agree to sponsor it. Without knowing, I suspect that probably the same people sponsored it, the same set of people, as sponsored the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, and that there was a community of activity which I accepted without question.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, an interlocking membership of these organizations?
Mr. FERRER. Certainly in my mind. In January 1946 Strange 'Fruit was on its last leg, a financial crisis for me, and I was preparing for Cyrano, and my feeling is that I would be very cursory in .my examination, and if I was asked to appear and it was something .at which I wanted to appear, I would say "yes" and forget about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was that?
Mr. FERRER. January 1946, when I was preparing Cyrano.
Mr. TAVENNER. At an earlier date, in May 1945, you were listed as a member of the Arts and Sciences Division of the American Committee for Spanish Freedom. In other words, it is a more formal sponsorship in that it is of a special division.
Mr. FERRER. In May 1945 we were completing our tour of Othello, which had taken us out of New York for 10 months. I probably allowed them to use my name. 548 INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. This organization was cited also by this commit- tee, but at a later date, 1948, and by the Attorney General in 1949. The committee is in possession of informtion indicating that on June 22, 1944, you were introduced as a guest speaker at a Negro Freedom Rally sponsored by the Negro Labor Victory Committee at Madison Square Garden, New York City, and that you were one of the entertainers at this function. Did you take part in that meeting'?
Mr. FERRER. Is there any document, Mr. Tavenner, that I could examine to refresh my memory as to who else participated ?
Mr. WooD. Does that mean you do not have any independent recollection?
Mr. FERRER. No, I don't, sir. My memory in most of these cases is by association.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall having attended that meeting spon- sored by the Negro Labor Victory Committee?
Mr. FERRER. I do not, Mr. Tavenner. I am sure I probably did, but I don't rerhember; no, sir. I could be very specific if I saw a document on the subject. But the chances are I did. I worked with a great number of Negro artists in the theater. I have seen them suffer injustices, and I am extremely sympathetic to their situation. I have here a note to the effect that this June 26, 1944, rally of the Negro Labor Victory Committee which you mentioned, one of the speakers at that rally was Mayor LaGuardia.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall that you took part in it?
Mr. FERRER. NO. Even the name of Mayor LaGuardia does not make me remember being there.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do know that the Negro Labor Victory Com- mittee has been cited as a Communist-front organization?
Mr. FERRER. I know that now; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Both by this committee and twice by the Attorney General, by Attorney General Tom Clark in his letters to the Loyalty Review Board released June 1, 1948, and September 21, 1948.
Mr. FERRER. TO the best of my knowledge I think that is my only connection with the Negro Labor Victory Committee. Isn't it?
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall anything about that meeting at all? You made mention of the fact that Mayor LaGuardia was there. Do you recall whether Benjamin J. Davis spoke there?
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember anything about the meeting. In fact, I do remember that in some of the research I made in connection with this appearance, I read that Mayor LaGuardia did not appear because of illness. I don't remember this occasion. I remember meeting Mr. Davis on another occasion.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the other occasion? (Representative Morgan M. Moulder left hearing room.)
Mr. FERRER. The other occasion was, I believe, in April 1944. It was a birthday celebration in honor of Paul Robeson at one of the armories, I believe the armory on Park Avenue in the thirties.
Mr. KEARNEY. Thirty-fourth Street?
Mr. FERRER. That would be the one. I do remember meeting Mr. Davis then because he was a speaker that night.
Mr. TAVENNER. What official position did he hold at that time in the city of New York?  INDUSTRY 549 
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember whether he already was councilman of the city of New York or running for councilman, but it was one or the other.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was in April 1944?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. When he did run for reelection you lent your name in support of his candidacy, did you not? 
Mr. FERRER. I am not sure that I did, Mr. Kearney, but if I did it was because, in my mind, he was being presented to me as being endorsed by. the Democratic Party.
Mr. KEARNEY. Was that endorsement subsequently withdrawn ?
Mr. FERRER. At the time he ran ? I don't know.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you contribute anything toward Mr. Davis' reelection?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know. I don't think so.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the September 25, 1945, issue of the Daily Worker, you became one of the group of sponsors for the elec- tion of Mr. Davis. The heading is, "Thousand artist, writers back Davis. Formation of an artists', writers', and professionals' group for reelection of Benjamin J. Davis was-announced yesterday by Paul Robeson, chairman of the new group." Then the article gives the names of sponsors, among whom your name Jose Ferrer, appears. Does that refresh your recollection?
Mr. FERRER. No. I have no recollection of ever authorizing my name to be used. I repeat, I may have authorized it to be used, but I don't remember. , 
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me hand you the article to see if your memory is fully refreshed, if it can be, on that point [handing article to the witness].
Mr. FERRER (after examining article). I don't remember, Mr. Tavenner. There are a great many names listed whom I remember among my acquaintances and friends.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name does appear there?
Mr. FERRER. My name does appear there; yes; and I probably au- thorized it, but I don't remember.
Mr. WooD. You say you probably authorized it. Have you any recollection ? 
Mr. FERRER. I have no recollection, but there are so many names of people I know and whom I have associated with that I would accept this as evidence against myself if it should be submitted. 
Mr. WOOD. That was what year?
Mr. FERRER. September 1945.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Davis was serving at that time as a member of the council ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember.
Mr. WOOD. You had met him?
Mr. FERRER. I had met him a few months before. 
Mr. Tavenner asked what was his position at that time, and I said he was either serving as councilman or was elected later. I don't remember.
Mr. WooD. Didn't you know that at that time he was serving as councilman, and that he had been elected on the Communist ticket?
Mr. FERRER. I did not. 
Mr. WooD. You didn't know that? 550 INDUSTRY 
Mr. FERRER. I did not.
Mr. WOOD. And at the time you say you probably sponsored his reelection, didn't you know he was being sponsored by the Communist Party ?
Mr. FERRER. I did not. If I had, I would not have authorized the use of my name.
Mr. WooD. Would you sponsor the reelection of a man without ascertaining on what party ticket he was running ?
Mr. FERRER. I linked him in my mind as being sponsored by the Democratic Party. This is only an evidence of how careless I can get. But I did not know he was running on the Communist ticket.
Mr. WOOD. You had no knowledge or information about it? 
Mr. FERRER. No.
Mr. WOOD. When did you find it out ?
Mr. FERRER. Recently, when I was doing research on the things listed against me.
Mr. WOOD. When was the last time you saw him?
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember seeing him after that birthday party. The next time his name was brought to my attention was when heand a number of others were brought up on trial as being-Mr. KEARNEY. One of the 11 defendants ?
Mr. FERRER. That was the next time I thought of Benjamin J. Davis, when his name became prominent in connection with that trial.
Mr. WOOD. You at that time were living in New York?
Mr. FERRER. I was.
Mr. WOOD. A registered voter of New York?
Mr. FERRER. I was on tour much of the time.
Mr. WOOD. You did vote?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir.
Mr. WooD. Have you ever voted?
Mr. FERRER. No. I have always been on tour when the elections: have been held. Actors usually go on tour September and October when everyone has to register.
Mr. KEARNEY. You mean you never even registered, then?
Mr. FERRER. No, because by the time I got my absentee ballot in Ossining, generally I was on tour. If I had voted for him I certainly would have known what party he was running on.
Mr. WOOD. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. I may have misunderstood your testimony. Do I understand you are in doubt as to whether you permitted your nameto be used in support of the candidacy of Benjamin J. Davis for councilman or not?
Mr. FERRER. I said I did not recollect giving permission to use my name, but after seeing the document submitted, with the list of names on it, I told Mr. Kearney, and I told Mr. Wood, that the chances were I probably had authorized the use of my name.
Mr. TAVENNER. You use the word "probably"? 
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to refer to a letter you addressed yesterday to the chairman' of the committee, and I quote from that letter: I have long supported the National Urban League and the Negro Actors' Guild of America, neither of which has any Communist connection, so far as I can find: but I also permitted my name to be used in support of the candidacy of Benjamin Davis as councilman of New York City.  551 
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. That doesn't indicate any uncertainty about au- thorization of use of your name for that purpose. tive statement that you did do that? It is a plain, posi- 
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Wasn't that correct; that you did permit the use of your name for that purpose ? 
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner, the reason I wrote this in the way I did is as follows: I assume that most of these charges that are leveled against me are true; most of them. If you ask me under oath, "Do you remember endorsing Benjamin Davis?", I say, "No; I don't remember," but I say I probably did when I see the list of names associated with me. I wrote this carelessly, again, for the purpose of simplicity.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am trying to get the facts. If you are uncertain, I want to know it.
Mr. FERRER. I am uncertain.
Mr. TAVENNER. We want the facts. 
Mr. FERRER. IS my position clear now ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I think so.
Mr. WooD. You were reading from a letter addressed to me as chair- man of the committee on the 21st ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. WooD. I believe that letter was released by you to the press on yesterday?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have asked you a question about the meeting of September 24th which announced the organization of a group with Paul Robeson as chairman to back Benjamin J. Davis in the campaign.
Mr. FERRER. What question did you ask me ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I referred to that. Now I am asking you as to what comment you have to make regarding an article which appeared in the Worker, issue of September 30, 1945, entitled "Ben Davis Backed by 1,000 Leaders in the Arts." This is subsequent to the holding of that meeting. I want to call a part of this to your attention, and then let you examine it. 
Mr. FERRER. Fine. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The article begins as follows: The campaign to reelect Benjamin J. Davis to the New York City Council is winning strong support from outstanding figures in the various cultural fields. Davis will have the active backing of leaders in the theater, radio, motion-picture, literary, fine arts, music, dance, educational, and allied fields. Headed by Paul Robeson, more than 1,000 citizens in these crafts last week announced the formation of an artists, writers and professional division of the Davis Nonpartisan Committee. They believe with Paul Robeson that "If Ben is reelected, that means we're in there." And further down in the article it states: "Sponsors of the artists, writers, and professional division, in addition to Paul Robeson as chairman, include" various persons, and among them appears the name of Jose Ferrer. This is the second article, you see, that appeared on this subject. Will you examine it and state whether or not that further refreshes your recollection, and that you now recall that you were a member of the so-called nonpartisan group? 552 INDUSTRY 
Mr. FERRER. I am sorry to say, Mr. Tavenner, that this does not refresh my memory. I repeat that among these people are many many people whom I know, whom I have worked with, and it is pos- sible and even probable that I did allow the use of my name, but I cannot in all honesty tell you that I remember doing so.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Kearney, did you have a question to ask?
Mr. KEARNEY. Yes. I would like to call your attention, Mr. Ferrer, to the letter that the chairman spoke about, under date of May 21, 1951, directed to him, of which I believe all members of the committee received a copy. I am simply searching for the truth. I can't reconcile your statement with that portion of your letter which states: "I also permitted my name to be used in support of the candidacy of Benjamin Davis as councilman of New York City."
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner just asked me about that, Mr. Kearney, and I told him that when I am now asked under oath, do I remember, I cannot honestly say "I do remember". The reason I wrote this this way-and I still say it was careless on my part-was that I come here to testify before you gentlemen assuming that most of the charges leveled against me are true.
Mr. KEARNEY. Is this true: "I also permitted my name to be used in support of the candidacy of Benjamin Davis as councilman of New York City."
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember, but I say it probably was, Mr. Kearney. Under oath I don't want to say it was. For the purposes of brevity and simplicity, in this letter I said it was true.
Mr. KEARNEY. We want to know if it was true.
Mr. FERRER. I can't honestly, completely say it was true.
Mr. KEARNEY. This letter was written 2 days ago.
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. KEARNEY. A lot of the matters you testified about occurred in 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945.
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. KEARNEY. Here, only 2 days ago, you stated definitely that you permitted your name to be used to further the candidacy of Benjamin Davis as councilman of New York City.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WooD. It is now 10 minutes after 12, and there is a quorum call; and, in order to enable the members of the committee to answer that call and get lunch, we will suspend until 2 o'clock. (Thereupon, at 12: 10 p. m., a recess was taken until 2 p. m. of the same day.) AFTER RECESS The hearing reconvened at 2:20 p. m., upon the expiration of the recess.
Mr. WOOD. The committee will be in order. Acting under the authority of the resolution establishing this committee, I, as chairman, have set up a subcommittee, for the purpose of continuing this hearing, of the full committee.
Mr. Doyle, Mr. Kearney, and Mr. Wood are present. Proceed. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSI'RY 553 TESTIMONY OF JOSE FERRER, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, ABE FORTAS AND EDWARD REISKIND-Resumed
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Ferrer, I was asking you this morning about your alleged endorsement of Benjamin Davis for election to the position of councilman of the city of New York in 1945. In connection with that, you were asked a question by a member of the committee regarding the alleged endorsement of Davis by the Democratic Party, and I made the statement at that time 1 had certain exhibits which I wanted to use to refresh your recollection regarding those matters. As I understand it, you made a statement this morning that he was endorsed by the Democratic Party. Am I correct in that?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir; or had been endorsed when I first met him, which was earlier that same year.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. FERRER. When I met him in April, which is the only time, as I remember, that I ever met him, I was introduced-he was introduced to me, or he was referred to.me as having been endorsed by the Democratic Party.
Mr. TAVE NNER. Now, I will read to you from the July 26, 1945, issue of the Daily Worker, in which Councilman Benjamin J. Davis, Jr., is stated to have charged that the action of the Democrats in withdrawing their designation of him for reelection was a disservice to the Democratic coalition of forces. In other words, Davis himself recognized, as shown by this article appearing in July 1945, that he recognized that that action had been taken by the local organization of the Democratic Party in withdrawing support. Now, do you not recall that that support was withdrawn after I have refreshed your recollection about it from this news article ? SMr. FERRER. I did not know it at the time, Mr. Tavenner, because if I had known that Davis was to all intents and purposes a candidate of the Communist Party, that he was affiliated with the Communist Party, and that he was serving allegiance to the Communist Party, I would never have lent my name to support him. And, as we went into it this mormng, I don't remember doing so, but I am willing, because of the list of people you showed me, to admit that I probably did. I have never seen an issue of the Daily Worker, and that is what you just quoted to me from. So I certainly never saw that article. (Representative Harold H. Velde entered hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. That is true; it is of the Daily Worker, which is an organ of the Communist Party.
Mr. FERRER. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. But if the Communist Party openly and avowedly takes a position, it is certainly reasonable to suppose that the public generally are aware of that situation.
Mr. FERRER. Definitely.
Mr. TAVENNER. I refer now to an article in the October 21, 1943, edition of the Communist Party.
Mr. FERRER. Of the Daily Worker, you mean?
Mr. TAVENNER. Of the Daily Worker, I meant to say-which is an organ of the Communist Party. 554 I think before I refer to that article I desire to refer to one appearing in the Daily Worker on August 28, 1945, which is still a date ahead of the time it is alleged that you gave your endorsement of Davis; in which this statement is made: The progressive forces in the labor and people's movement are also rallying to the reelection of their champion. The New York CIO Council has endorsed and will actively campaign for Davis's reelection. True, Davis is the nominee of only the Communist Party, but he was elected through the support of broad circles of our citizens in 1943 as the candidate of the Communist Party alone. That is a statement appearing in the Communist press in August 1945 as to Davis' status in 1943, when he ran for the council. (Representative Donald L. Jackson entered hearing room.) 
Mr. FERRER. If I may interject something, I was told during the luncheon recess, Mr. Tavenner-which I didn't know, but I submit it in the interests of accuracy-I was told that candidates for council do not run on a party ticket. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, are not petitions filed by those who become candidates for the city council in New York? 
Mr. FERRER. Apparently on a nonpartisan basis, as I was told, Mr. Tavenner. This is not my knowledge. I am passing this on in the interests of accuracy. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And do they not have to state on what party ticket they are running? Is not that a fact? I am asking for information. I am not a specialist on the laws of New York by any means. You do not know; is that right ? 
Mr. FERRER. No; I do not, sir. If I had, I would have mentioned it before lunch. 
Mr. KEARNEY. But there is not any dispute; is there, Mr. Ferrer- 
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; there is not. 
Mr. KEARNEY (continuing). That during the time that he was a candidate, even under the so-called nonpartisan basis, that he wag a candidate of the Communist Party?
Mr. FERRER. I merely offer this as a possible reason why I did not know that he was a candidate of the Communist Party; besides which, I was given to understand in his earlier candidacy in 1943 he had been endorsed by the Democratic Party, it is true, before September. According to what you tell me, sir, their support had been withdrawn. I did not know about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. It seems strange that you should know that the local organization at one time supported the candidacy of Davis, and yet you at the same time are unaware of the fact that Davis was elected on the Communist Party ticket in 1943 and again in 1945. 
Mr. FERRER. It may seem strange, Mr. Tavenner, but it remains the fact. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I think we have probably a petition of Ben Davis to run as councilman, and we will see whether or not it does provide on what party ticket. (After examining document). Mr. Ferrer, there appears on Davis' petition for reelection the name of "Jose Ferrer" and the address of the person given, whose name is given as "Jose Ferrer," is 65 East One Hundred and Tenth Street, New York City. Was that your name, or is it the name of another person?  INDUSTrRY 555 
Mr. FERRER. That is the name of another person.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever live at 65 East One Hundred and Tenth Street ?
Mr. FERRER. No sir; I never have.
Mr.-TAVENNER. bid you'at any time sign a petition for Ben Davis?
Mr. FERRER. Not to the best of my recollection, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have before me now Mr. Ferrer a nominating petition for councilman, Borough of Manhattan, addressed to the board of elections in the city of New York, under date of August 13, 1945, which shows that the candidate selects and designates the party ticket upon which he is running. In this instance it is the Communist Party. I will ask you to look at this and verify that fact, as it is contrary to what you stated you have been advised during the recess (handing ,document to witness). You will find it in the first paragraph. Do you understand
Mr. FERRER (after examining document). I think I do, Mr. Tavenner. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever signed a similar petition for Ben Davis ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember ever signing; I don't remember ever :seeing such a petition, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. The petition does state
Mr. FERRER. Yes; it does. 
Mr. TAVENNE (continuing.) On its face that the individual desig- nates the Communist Party in this particular instance.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. You understand, Mr. Tavenner, that I did not mention that in order to evade any responsibility I may have in this matter.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand. I believe you stated that you first became acquainted with Benjamin Davis at the birthday party that was given in April 1944 for Paul Robeson. Did I understand you to say that ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long had you known Paul Robeson ? 
Mr. FERRER. I met Paul Robeson, I believe, in the spring of 1942- it was either the spring or the early summer-at a brief interview, which lasted a few minutes, the purpose of which interview was for him to meet me and either approve or disapprove of me as the actor to play the role of lago in Othello. Apparently I met with his approval. I did not see him again until we began rehearsing in the late summer of 1942. We rehearsed for 2 weeks and we played for 2 weeks.; 1 week in Cambridge, Mass., and 1 week in Princeton, N. J. Then I don't believe I saw him again for a year, until we began rehearsals in the late summer of 1943 for the Broadway engagement of Othello. The Broadway engagement, after a number of weeks out of town, in September and October, opened in New York on, I believe, October 19, 1943-I think it was around that time-and ran into June, I think, of '44. 556 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY We had a few weeks off that summer, during which time we recordedan album of records of almost the entire play of Othello for Columbia Records. And then in the fall of 1944 we started this 10-month tour, visiting, I believe, forty-odd cities that I mentioned earlier in my testimony.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say "we," to whom do you refer?
Mr. FERRER. I am referring to the theatrical company involved in. rehearsal. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Paul Robeson associated in all those trips? .Mr. FERRER. Oh, yes. He was the star of the play. He played Othello.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that was through the year 1945?
Mr. FERRER. Until June of '45. Then we disbanded in June.
Mr. TAVENNER. He is the person named as the chairman in the press- release of September 25, and also of September 30, of this artist's group to promote the election of Ben Davis.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he talk to you about your support of Ben Davis?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner, I don't remember whether he did, or not, but it is entirely possible that he did, yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he ever discuss with you the Communist Party ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he ever make any statement to you with refer- ence to the Communist Party ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. 
Mr. VELDE. You are sure about that, but you are not sure about the support of Ben Davis ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, I am, Mr. Velde. And I will tell you why: Because, strange as it seems, I don't believe I recognized Mr. Davis as a Communist candidate. Had Mr. Robeson ever spoken to me about the Communist Party or Communist matters at all, I would have been very aware of the conversation.
Mr. KEARNEY. Would that be true of all left-wing organizations ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't understand your question, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEANEY. Would that be true of all Communist-front organ- izations ?
Mr. FERRER. If they had Communist conversations with me?
Mr. KEIRNEY. Yes.
Mr. FERRER. Oh, it certainly would be true; yes, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. And that would be also true as far as your attitude, of course, toward Communist organizations?
Mr. FERRER. Definitely. Definitely.
Mr. KEARNEY. I would like to show the witness Mr. Counsel, a pic- ture appearing in the Daily Mirror and ask him to inform the committee under what circumstances that picture was taken [handing to
Mr. Tavenner].
Mr. FERRER. I know the picture, Mr. Tavenner, if you want me to answer the question without looking. I saw enough from what Mr. Kearney had in his hand. The picture appeared in the Daily Mirror, I believe, and under a column by Victor Reisel (Rye-sell) or Reisel (Ree-sell).
Mr. TAVENNER. That is right. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 557 
Mr. FERRER. And the name of the man in the photograph with me is Charles Collins.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is correct.
Mr. FERRER. I had completely forgotten this incident and I don't to this day remember it, but my press agent in Cyrano does remember it. He is the man who is working for me now as press agent for Twentieth Century and for my more recent production, Stalag 17. When this appeared in the paper. I showed it to him and I said, "This man Reisel (Rye-sell) "-or Reisel (Ree-sell) "says that I left the theater in make-up and costume to be photographed with Mr. Collins." And I said to him, "I remember very distinctly that the only time I ever left the theater in make-up or in costume in Cyrano was on three occasions." I then named the three occasions. I am very definite about everything that happens.to me in the.theater. My. memory is extremely accurate about my theatrical activity and I do not go out in the street wearing a long nose, a wig, a beard, a mustache, and a flowery 200year-old costume casually. I did not leave the theater for that photograph despite what Mr. Reisel (Rye-sell) says.
Mr. Lipsky remembers that we were taking press photographs in the theater at this occasion and that a phone call came in, and somebody whom I know, whom I knew, whose name I don't rememberI don't even remember whether it was a man or a woman-said, "There is a Negro called Charles Collins running for office in New York. Would you endorse him?" And very stupidly again I said, "Sure; send him over and we will take a picture." So they took a picture of a man I have never seen before or since. I have completely forgotten the incident.
Mr. KEARNEY. You did not even know what party ticket the gentleman in question was running on ?
Mr. FERRER. Only to this extent, sir: that I was probably told what the party ticket was, and it was not the Communist Party.
Mr. KEARNEY. IS it your custom to endorse candidates that are running on any political ticket ?
Mr. FERRER. Generally speaking, no, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. In this particular instance, did you endorse the candidacy of Charles A. Collins ?
Mr. FERRER. I am not sure that I endorsed it, Mr. Kearney. I was asked to be photographed with him shaking hands, and I did. I never endorsed Mr. Collins, that I know of.
Mr. KEARNEY. At that time, did you know what political party Mr. Collins was running on and for what office?
Mr. FERRER. I was probably told at the time; yes, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. You do not remember now ?
Mr. FERRER. I only remember what I have read since.
Mr. KEARNEY. If I refreshed your memory by saying that I read from this article that he was a candidate for senator in the State of New York,.on the American Labor Party ticket, would that refresh your recollection ? 558 
Mr. FERRER. I have read the article, Mr. Kearney, and I don't remember the incident.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you, at the time you endorsed this candidacy, know about what ticket he was running on ?
Mr. FERRER. I was probably told, Mr. Kearney. I don't remember now. I can't conceive that I was not told.
Mr. KEARNEY. You cannot conceive of endorsing anybody running for a political office until you know what ticket he is running on ?
Mr. FERRER. That is right. 
Mr. KEARNEY. But from your testimony here today, it is probably true that you have endorsed candidates not knowing what ticket they were running on.
Mr. FERRER. Maybe not knowing, Mr. Kearney, but thinking I knew, thinking I knew.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you contribute any funds to the candidacy of
Mr. Collins?
Mr. FERRER. Very strongly I did not. I never laid eyes on him before or since, and I never heard of him again until this article. However, we can check the list, if you wish.
Mr. KEARNEY. However, you did hear of him at the time you had your picture taken ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes; I certainly did, because I was photographed shaking hands with him.
Mr. KEARNEY. Outside of that list that was handed to the committee through counsel, were there any contributions made through cash? Those are checks. Did you make any contributions to any political party or any political candidate by cash?
Mr. FERRER. I am morally certain that I did not, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. But you do not know definitely as to whether you contributed to Mr. Collins' candidacy, or not?
Mr. FERRER. I am pretty sure I didn't.
Mr. KEARNEY. Can you swear that you did not ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Kearney, I am very careful about what I swear to, because I don't want, through carelessness or eagerness to finish with a subject, to commit perjury, and that is why I am being so, careful. I am not trying to avoid any responsibility. When I tell you that. I amMr. KEARNEY. I would be the first one, Mr. Ferrer, of this com-mittee, to suggest that you did not commit perjury.
Mr. FERRER. You would be the first one to suggest that I did ?
Mr. KEARNEY. That you did not.
Mr. FERRER. That I didn't; yes, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you make any speeches for Mr. Collins ?
Mr. FERRER No, sir. That I know.
Mr. Woon. To further clarify the matter of contributions: A list has been furnished here to counsel and to the members of the committee, which is headed "Contributions of Jose Ferrer, 1943, through 1950, based on information derived from check stubs and the records of the subcommittee, including all identifiable contributions." Does this list contain an itemized statement of all the contributions:that you made either to charitable, eleemosynary institutions, or in-dividuals about which you now have any knowledge?  559 
Mr. FORTAS. May I answer that, Mr. Chairman ? 
Mr. WOOD. I do not see how you could possibly answer what was within the witness' knowledge. 
Mr. FORTAS. I am sure I could not answer, but I can tell you how this list was prepared, if you would like to know.
Mr. Ferrer did not prepare it on the basis of information furnished, ascertained from his check books, by counsel. In other words, counsel went through all of Mr. Ferrer's check stubs.
Mr. WOOD. Then, as I understand it, these items that are here listed are reflected in stubs of checks.
Mr. FORTAS. Yes, sir; and they are all available.
Mr. WooD. All of them ?
Mr. FORTAS. All of those items are on his check stubs and they are all available to your investigators.
Mr. WOOD. The question I would like to ask is this: Are these items of contributions which you made either to charitable, eleemosynary institutions, or to individuals, which were paid by checks by you ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Wood, the only item of that nature that I'would have made would be the sort of thing when you are stopped on the street and asked to buy a poppy or to help the orphans, or that sort of thing; I never, never make contributions except by check, because that is one thing that I like to keep a record of.
Mr. WooD. Then do I understand that such contributions, where they were made in fact by cash, are not now within your recollection? That you do not recall any of them? Or could you name some?
Mr. FERRER. As I say, the Veterans' Day poppies, and that sort of thing. Do I mnake myself clear to you on this point, sir? 
Mr. WooD. Did you make available to your counsel these stubs of all the checks that you have in your possession that reflect contributions made within this period of 1943 to 1950 ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir; I turned all the check books over to him. Everything. I did not select check books. 
Mr. WOOD. So that there are no contributions within the period mentioned here and that is '43 to '50-is that inclusive, '43 to '50
Mr. FORTAS. Yes. Let me take a look at this.
Mr. WOOD. Let us leave it between those 2 years, between 1943 and 1950.
Mr. FERRER. I am sure it is inclusive, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WooD. All inclusive?
Mr. FERRER. I am sure it is. 
Mr. Fortas' office did the work.
Mr. WooD. All right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Ferrer- 
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to ask you now regarding various May Day celebrations which you participated in in one form or another, either as a sponsor or otherwise. I have before me the April 22,1946, issue of the Daily Worker, which shows a headline: "Noted artist, professionals, back May Day. Parlay spurs parade preparations." 560 INDUSTRY The article proceeds to state: Some of the outstanding names in the cultural and other professional fields today lent their support to the forthcoming May Day parade and urged a unity of professionals and trade-unionists in the battle for peace and security. Famous names of stage, among writers, artists, and radio topnotchers were included in the list, who urged a gigantic turn-out on May Day as a fitting answer to the war makers by the American people. And your name, "Jose Ferrer, actor," appears as one of those enun- ciating that position.
Mr. FERRER. Sponsoring the May Day parade?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. Will you tell the committee the circumstances upon which you sponsored that parade and urged the turn-out that it referred to here?
Mr. FERRER. Well, Mr. Tavenner, I don't remember sponsoring the parade. However, it is entirely possible that I did, because I did not know at the time, and, in fact, I only found out a few weeks or a couple of months ago, that May Day was the annual celebration of the American Communist Party. Yes, I knew that May Day had a connection with Soviet Russia. If I sponsored this parade it was with the thought that since Russia had been our ally in the recent war, this was, along with a great many other people, a casual tribute to Russia. I never urged any turn-out for the May Day parade I never spoke in behalf of the May Day parade. And if I endorsed it at all, somebody came up to me and said, "Can we use your name?" and I said, "Yes," and forgot about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, this language is also included in the endorse- ment; it says: Topnotchers were included in the list, who urged a gigantic turn-out on May Day as a fitting answer to the war makers by the American people. Now, this was in 1946.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were the war makers?
Mr. FERRER. The Daily Worker knows better than I, Mr. Tavenner. That is their newspaper. I have never seen the Daily Worker and I don't want to have their words put into my mouth.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Ferrer, do you want this committee to believe that during all the years you lived in New York City, that you never knew that May Day was the Communist Party day in the city of New York and all over the Nation '
Mr. FERRER. I would like them to believe, but even if they don't, it is the truth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, you supported the May Day on more than one annual occurrence, did you not?
Mr. FERRER. I am supposed to have; I don't think I did. supposed to have supported it in 1949 also.
Mr. WooD. You said you are supposed to?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. I am 
Mr. WOOD. On what do you base that statement, Mr. Ferrer?
Mr. FERRER. On the fact that in Red channels, I believe, and in other lists that have appeared in newspapers against me, my name is listed as a supporter of the May Day parade of 1949.  561 
Mr. WOOD. Is that the only evidence of your support, alleged sup- port, that you know of ? 
Mr. FERRER. There may be other photostatic evidence, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WOOD. Do you have any independent recollection ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I do not.
Mr. WOOD. In 1949?
Mr. FERRER. But I know this: That by 1949 even I was beginning to understand some of these issues, and I would have been very, very chary, I think, of lending my support to the May Day parade of 1949.
Mr. KEARNEY. When you acted as a sponsor for this one May Day celebration, did you take the trouble to find out whether it was sponsored by the Communist Party, or not ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Kearney, as I remember, not because I remember what happened then, but subsequent research has shown that this May Day parade in 1946 was endorsed, among other people, by the American Federation of Labor and the CIO. I would like to say something, which is that my testimony, I think, will make clear, as we go along, the fact that I have time and time and time again used sign posts. I have relied on the names of other people, the names of organizations in whom I had faith, to guide me m letting my name be used. If I may make an analogy, if any of you gentlemen were to come to New York and say you wanted to see a show, you would pick up a newspaper, and if you saw the name of Helen Hayes, the name of Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne, or the name of Katherine Cornell, you would assume that it is worth seeing because these people have built up a reputation through the years. When I see something endorsed by the American Federation of Labor, of which I am a member, and the CIO, when I see Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt's name, or Fiorrelo LaGuardia's name, of Mayor O'Dwyer's name, I drop my guard and say, "Yes, I think it is safe to go along with these people." I have been wrong time and time again, and so have they.
Mr. KEARNEY. So have some of the individuals you mentioned.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, they have, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. TAVENNER. What I am interested in, in addition to what you say, is: How did your support of all those organizations come about ? You just do not go out looking for those things.
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I certainly don't. I know that one of the purposes of this investigation is to find that out. You told me very kindly and very clearly at the beginning of the investigation, and if I were able to think of a name or remember a person who said, "Come here, will you sign this paper?", I would hasten to give it to you, Mr. Tavenner. So far I have not remembered anything specific.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the letterhead of the American Relief for Greek Democracy, bearing date of November 15, 1946, you were one of the sponsors of that organization. Will you tell us how you became a sponsor of that organization?
Mr. FERRER. Could I see a document on the subject, sir, please ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir [handing document to witness].
Mr. FERRER. Thank you. 81595-51-pt. 3-3 562 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY [After examining document.] I do not remember, Mr. Tavenner, how I became associated with this organization.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you affiliated with the Civil Rights Congress ? 
Mr. FERRER. I don't know, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the January 19, 1946, issue of the- Daily Worker, page 12, there is an article entitled, "Anti-Bias Vets. Win Hunter College for Rally," at which you were listed as a speaker for the Veterans Against Discrimination, of the Civil Rights Congress of New York. Does that refresh your recollection ? In other words, the Veterans Against Discrimination was a branch of the Civil Rights Congress-at which it is alleged you appeared as a speaker for it.
Mr. FERRER. I would like to make a positive statement at this time. I generally have a very, very clear recollection of the auditoriums, theaters, and halls at which I speak, and that is why so often I ask to let me see the document, because if the document tells me where this took place, it refreshes my memory. I have appeared at Hunter College on one or two occasions, and I don't remember any of them being political. I do not remember appearing at Hunter College on this occasion. I very clearly do not. If I did, it will surprise me greatly, because I do not remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. I should call to your attention and make it plain, if I have not already done so, that this stated that the meeting would be held. It does not state that you had spoken.
Mr. FERRER. I see. Well, I have no recollection. That was January of 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is right, sir. 
Mr. FERRER. At that time, my show Strange Fruit was closing, and I was beginning to work on Cyrano. And I would like to remark once more, if I may, that this sort of activity, numerous though it has been through the years, is extremely peripheral and that I worked very, very hard continually at my profession in the theater, and that this sort of thing is the kind of thing that they call you up-or you receive a letter-and say, "Will you be there?" "At what time?" "Nine-fifteen." And I will be up there at 9:15 and I will go and say "Hello" and leave. Or I appear, or whatever I have to do, and it does not penetrate my consciousness or my memory the way my work does. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The next instance I will call to your attention is of a little more concrete character, because your name appears on the letterhead of the Veterans Against Discrimination, of Civil Rights Congress, as a public sponsor. The letter bears the date of May 11 1946. bo you recall having become a sponsor of the Veterans Against Discrimination, of Civil Rights Congress ?
Mr. FERRER. No, Sir; I do not. May 11, 1946, I was busy playing in Boston in Cyrano. We had received very bad notices and I was killing myself trying to make a hit out of a flop. COMMUNISM IN' MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 563 I had been working very hard on the show for 3 months and I have no recollection whatever of having time to do anything of this sort. 
Mr. TAVENNER. This may refresh your recollection about the par- ticular thing: This letter on the stationery of the Veterans Against Discrimination, of Civil Rights Congress advertises a mass rally to abolish the Wood-Rankin committee. Does not that refresh your recollection. 
Mr. FERRER. What date is this, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. The date the meeting was to be held was May 23, 1946, at the Manhattan Center.
Mr. FERRER. Yes. No, by then I was in Philadelphia, still worrying.
Mr. TAVENNER. In fact, the letter, on its face, states: The Un-American Committee can and must be abolished. Maybe you had better look at the document and see if that refreshes your recollection [handing document to witness].
Mr. FERRER (after examining document). No, it does not refresh my recollection. What is it you would like me to recollect?
Mr. TAVENNER. As to whether or not you sponsored a meeting, a mass meeting, to be held to abolish the Wood-Rankin committee.
Mr. FERRER. I do not remember sponsoring that.
Mr. TAVENNER. If yOU noted, the letter refers to the fact that Dr. Edward K. Barsky, chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee of which we have shown your activityMr. FERRER. Definitely.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Was to be one of the speakers. You recall, do you not, that this committee had subpenaed Dr. Barsky before it in an effort to ascertain how the funds of that organization, in which you were a participant or in which you were active, were being usedMr. FERRER. For which I had appeared a few times; which is differ- ent from being active in the committee. I was never active in the committee, Mr. Tavenner. I may have been their instrument, but I was never active in the committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. I understand what you mean. Does that not refresh your recollection of what you were sponsoring, according to the record here, the written record ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. I am sorry to say that I do not remember sponsoring that. I may have sponsored it, but I do not remember doing so. Your question is: Do I remember ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. FERRER. My answer must be I do not remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do not remember. But quite evidently, you did sponsor it at that time.
Mr. FERRER. I probably did, Mr. Tavenner; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, does that mean that at that time you held to the view that Dr. Barsky should not have been required by this committee to produce evidence from its records as to what it was doing with the money which was being collected on the public assertion that it was going for relief in Spain ? 564 COMlMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. FuRRER. No, sir; it does not mean that at all. It means that, along with a lot of other people, I did not always approve of the method of action of Mr. Dies, as later on I did not always approve of the method of action of Mr. Parnell Thomas. And I believe you said this meeting was directed against this committee, did you not, sir ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. FERRER. And has nothing to do with Mr. Barsky and his books, in my mind. 
Mr. TAVENNER. But Mr. Barsky was one of the principal speakers at this meeting which you sponsored. 
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir; but I haveMr. TAVENNER. Do you not think there is a connection there ?
Mr. FEPRER. There probably is. I am just trying to point out it is possible that I was not aware of it, Mr. Tavenner, because for weeks I had been out of town. I had been out of town with an ailing show.
Mr. TAVENNER. Another speaker was the Reverend Richard Morford, executive secretary of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, who had also been subpenaed before this committee, and who had refused to give information about a subject of inquiry over which this committee had jurisdiction.
Mr. FERRER. To the best of my knowledge, I never heard of the Rev- erend Morford until this instance. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Another person who was to speak, according to this letter, the letter of the organization of which you were a public sponsor, was George Marshall, who was chairman of the national board, Civil Rights Congress. That was the board of the congress of which this very organization was a branch. And he likewise had appeared before this committee and had refused to give it information relating to source of funds which they were inquiring about. Does that not bring to your mind that there was a definite connection ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. If you want, I can go through the list of sponsors and point out some very, very notorious anti-Communists, such as Mr. John Golden, whose name is very prominent there right below mine; a man who by no description could be called a sympathizer or interested in the least way in communism, except to destroy it, a very important member of my profession, sir. A man whom I have known and admired for many years, and a man whose name I would hold impeccable.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you say, then, that, as far as you are con- cerned, the Communist Party angle to this organization was not being endorsed by you. Is that it ?
Mr. FERRER. No Communist Party angle has ever been endorsed by me knowingly, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you learn of this mass meeting after it was held?
Mr. FERRER. I don't remember the meeting now, Mr. Tavenner, so I don't know whether I did learn of it, or not, since I have no recollection of it. I was out of town at the time. I was in Philadelphia..
Mr. TAVENNER. It would rather seem, then, if you disapproved of any of these movements, that you would have taken some action to see that it did not recur. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 565 
Mr. FERRER. Oh, yes. But in order to disapprove it and in order to take the action, you have to know about it. And I have been trying to point out, Mr. Tavenner, that through extreme activity in my theatrical field and also through plain, stupid carelessness, that I have not known about a lot of things that I undoubtedly should have known about. I am perfectly willing to assume the responsibility of ignorance, but I cannot assume the responsibility of knowledgeable guilt.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is more than just a question of assuming responsi- bility. We want to know the circumstances under which it occurred and under which it was done.
Mr. FERRER. In my particular case, I don't know how my name was gotten, who approached me, or in what manner. I do know that during this period I was working as hard as it seems possible for a human being to work, to take a play that had received bad notices in Boston and try to make a hit out of it, because it was a hundred thou- sand dollar proposition, thirty or forty thousand dollars of which was my own money, and my future and the future of my child was very much at stake in this play.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now I want to ask you a number of questions relat- ing to the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions. Were you at any time affiliated with the Puerto Rican Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions ? I think that is not quite the correct name. Is there a title "Casa de Puerto Rico," Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't-I mentioned several Latin-American groups in my letter, the Spanish-American Youth Bureau, the Union de Mujeres Americanos, and the Casa de Puerto Rico, in Harlem. My only connection with the ICC [Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions], Mr. Tavenner, that I know of-and this is one that I do remember-was as head of the theater division. My interest in ICC was to further theatrical activity to increase the interest of the public in the theater.
Mr. JACKSON. What is the "ICC"? 
Mr. FERRER. Independent Citizens' Committee, which Mr. Taven- ner mentioned. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Pro- fessions. 
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right, now, had you completed your statement?
Mr. FERRER. Just that my activity for them was chairman of the theater division, and my main concern was the development of the theater, if possible.
Mr. WOOD. On page 3 of your letter to me, you stated that you sponsored the Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions for the reelection of Mr. Roosevelt, in the first paragraph on the page.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, I remember it.
Mr. WOOD. Does that aid in refreshing your recollection ?
Mr. FERRER. In what respect, Mr. Wood ?
Mr. WooD. I understood the counsel to ask you if you had been a sponsor of that organization. 566 INDUSTRY 
Mr. FERRER. No. Counsel asked me if I had been a sponsor of any Puerto Rican group in the Independent Citizens' Committee, and I answered that I did not remember ever sponsoring a Puerto Rican group, but that I did remember very distinctly being chairman of the theater division of the Independent Citizens' Committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall having attended a meeting at the Essex House in New York City on January 5, 1946, where a conference was being held, entitled "Puerto Rico Rights to Freedom"?
Mr. FERRER. I remember going to the Essex House one night, and 'I didn't know that the conference had this purpose. I remember being given a highball when I arrived, being introduced to Frank Roosevelt, Jr., being introduced to a gentleman by the name of Polleti, I believeWas that his name?
Mr. REISKIND. Yes.
Mr. FERRER (continuing). Staying for a half an hour and leaving. Social chit-chat was my entire contribution to the thing, and I left very soon thereafter. This was probably the meeting I was referring to, since I have been very seldom in the Essex House, that I remember this.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were you a speaker on that occasion ?
Mr. FERRER. Oh, no. There were about 10 people in the room. I knew nobody but the people in the room. They all know more about it than I.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then were you not a speaker at any such conference as I have described ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I was not.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of having had a position or a chairmanship, I believe, of the art division.
Mr. FERRER. Theater division.
Mr. TAVENNER. The theater division of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions. When did you hold that position and that office, and for how long a period of time?
Mr. FERRER. I think that I-what do you say-received the office, moved into the office, or whatever the term is-I accepted the office, I would say, sometime in 1945, when I came back from tour in Othello. I believe that Mr. Louis Callhern had been the chairman up to then; either Mr. Callhern or Mr. Frederic March. I think it was Callhern, I am not sure. Anyway, I believe that I accepted the office sometime in 1945, and what happened was as follows: As regards my position in this officeThe first year we had quite a number of meetings, talking about forming rehearsal groups, proposing a fine-arts bill in Washington, trying to increase theatrical attendance, lowering the 20 percent theater ticket rate; all that kind of thing. The purpose was how to make more peoeple want to go to the theater more so that employment and activity in the theater would be increased. As time went along, I became more and more busy, more and more active in my own theatrical endeavor. I became less and less active and as the ICC began to become other organizations and change names periodically and the messages that I received from them got less and less theatrical and more and more political, I slowly  567 faded out of the picture, and although I never fully severed connection with them, I would say after about the first year-and I am a little hazy about this-after the first year or two, my connection was extremely tenuous.
Mr. TAV*ENNER. Did you become a member of the board of directors?
Mr. FERRER. I think one was automatically a member of the board -of directors if one was the chairman of a division, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, the May 18, 1948, issue of the Daily Worker states that you were chairman of the theater division of the New York City Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. In that same article it is indicated that on, I believe, the very evening of your election, or, rather, probably it was on 18th day of May, the date of the issue of the Daily Worker, that there would be a meeting to protest the Mundt bill, which was then before the House of Representatives ? Did you organize this meeting for the purpose of discussing the Mundt bill?
Mr. FERRER. This May 18, 1948 ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.
Mr. FmuREt. Can you tell me where the meeting was held, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. At the Mansfield Theater, West Forty-seventh Street, on Tuesday, May 18, 1948, at 11: 30.
Mr. FERRER. I know the Mansfield Theater well because I have worked on Forty-seventh Street on several occasions. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Herbert Biberman, a screen writer, who was one -of the Hollywood 10, was listed as one of the speakers at this meeting.
Mr. FEaRRm. I am sure I did not organize it, because I have never met Mr. Biberman, and I don't remember ever being in the Mansfield 'Theater backstage. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, you, as chairman of the theater division of the -New York City council, must have had some responsibility ?
Mr. FERRER. Undoubtedly so. 
Mr. TAVENNER. In the conduct and the call of that meeting.
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Tavenner, what may very well have happened was that they said, "You are the chairman; can we have the meeting?" and I said, "Go ahead," and, "I am busy at the city center, just don't involve me in it."
Mr. TAVENNER. You do not mean to say you were just a figurehead 'in this organization ? 
Mr. FERRER. I certainly mean to say exactly that. I would feel very badly if I was anything but a figurehead.
Mr. TAVENNER. Why ? 
Mr. FERRER. -Because, from what you tell me, this was not an organi- -zation to be too intimately connected with, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you not know it then ? 
Mr. FERRER. If I had known it, sir, I would not have been connected -withit. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say "they" asked you to go ahead with 'this meeting, that the meeting would be held, to whom were you referring? 
Mr. FERRER. I am referring to someone who would call me from -their office on the phone. 
Mr. WOOD. Are you saying that that happened, or are you spectn- axating that probably would happen ? 568 INDUSTRY 
Mr. FERRER. I am speculating that probably is what happened.
Mr. WOOD. You have no recollection about it ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I do not.
Mr. WOOD. I do not think we get very far with pursuing the course of investigation when the witness cannot remember any details and it is pure speculation. It is not accomplishing very much for the committee or to the witness.
Mr. TAVENNER. I did not realize that. I thought in this instance that someone had phoned him.
Mr. FERRER. No, I didn't recall. I said quite definitely that, my memory being what it is, I don't remember being backstage in the Mansfield Theater. Then I began to speculate when you said, "Your name was used on this thing," and I said I probably gave a careless authorization. I was then preparing the spring season for the New York City Center and working very hard at that.
Mr. WooD. In other words, your details are of certain circumstances which may have existed.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. WooD. And, of course, the procedure that may have been followed.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. WooD. But you have no recollection about it.
Mr. FERRER. No, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Were you ever connected in any way with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade?
Mr. FERRER. Not that I know of, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you ever contribute any funds toward that organization ?
Mr. FERRER. Not that I remember, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. It could be that you possibly did, though ?
Mr. FERRER. Under oath, I won't say "No." But I don't remember ever doing so, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, if it is not so, there would not be any stub in your checkbook from the list that you sent up here to the committee showing any such contribution.
Mr. FERRER. That is right. If I have contributed between 1943 and 1950 it would be on that list.
Mr. KEARNEY. Unless you contributed it in cash.
Mr. FERRER. No, I never did contribute it in cash. I never con- -tributed this kind of thing in cash.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Ferrer, I will hand you the news item of May 11, 1948. It may be that on further study of it your recollection may be refreshed as to the part you played as chairman in the holding of that meeting [handing document to witness].
Mr. FERRER (after examining document). This clipping from the Daily Worker, Mr. Tavenner, confirms my impression that I was not at this meeting. I know Alfred Drake very well. I have never laid eyes on Herbert Biberman. I know Miss Muriel Smith, and I know Mr. James Gow. And I would certainly have remembered if I had been there.  INDUSTRY 569 This says that sponsoring the meeting are the theater, radio, music divisions, and that I am the chairman of the theater division.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the June 11, 1948, issue of the Daily Worker there appears an article in which it is stated that- Jose Ferrer was elected vice chairman of the organization meeting of the New York Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, held on June 9, 1948. Were you elected as vice chairman of the organization meeting of this New York branch of the organization?
Mr. FERRER. If I was, sir-and you say the Daily Worker says I was?
Mr. TAVENNER. The Daily Worker says so. 
Mr. FERRER. Well, that seems to be-to make it-I knew nothing about this. I was working at the City Center then and I was about to go to start in summer stock on Long Island, Mr. Tavenner. I was elected without my knowledge. I certainly did not run for office in competition with anybody else.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you were rather active as an official in various branches of the organization, having been chairman of the actors' division.
Mr. FERRER. The theater division.
Mr. TAVENNER. Vice chairman of the New York branch of the or- ganization, and a director of the organization. definite connection. It shows a rather 
Mr. FERRER. Oh, the connection is there, definitely, Mr. Tavenner, but I would say rather than that I was active, I was extremely in- active in these capacities. I did nothing in these capacities.
Mr. WooD. Extremely inactive, did you say ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. It appears from the December 29, 1948, issue of the Daily Worker that Jose Ferrer was among the signers of a statement issued by the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, demanding the abolition of the Committee on Un-American Activi- ties. Do you recall that--that you were a signer of such a letter?
Mr. FERRER. I do not recall it, sir, but I- 
Mr. TAVENNER. Or a statement. 
Mr. FERRER. I beg your pardon ?
Mr. TAVENNER. A letter or a statement.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, but I don't recall it. 
Mr. WooD. Was the subject ever mentioned to you ?
Mr. FERRER. Probably, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WooD. Do you recall it?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I do not.
Mr. WooD. Can you recall?
Mr. FERRER. When you say "ever," do you meanMr. WooD. The subject of the abolition of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities.
Mr. FERRER. Do you mean at this time, or at any time ?
Mr. WooD. At that time.
Mr. FERRER. I cannot recall.
Mr. WooD. You cannot?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. 570 INDUSTRY 
Mr. KEARNEY. I do not quite understand that answer, Mr. Chair- man. Do I understand the witness to say that at no time during the past year he ever remembers talking with anyone about the abolition of this committee ?
Mr. WooD. That is not what he said. I asked him about the time the proposal was up and that is the time I asked.
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Wood asked me specifically of around December 1948.
Mr. KEARNEY. I will withdraw that question.
Mr. WooD. Well, for approximately 3 years, from early 1946 until the latter part of 1948-let us put it between those two dates-was the subject of the abolition of this committee ever mentioned to you by any person?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, I am sure it was. I remember discussing it on various occasions. I don't remember who I discussed it with, or how,. but I remember discussing it. But I remember, for instance-if this is the sort of think you want to know, Mr. Wood-that when I was in California shooting Joan of Arc with Ingrid Bergman, which was when the business of the Hollywood Ten began, and along with most of the motion picture colony and the people that I subsequently worked with in the theater, I came back and I felt a certain amount of disapproval of the way Mr. Thomas conducted the hearings. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, I believe the record should stand cor- rected there. I do not believe that "most" of the motion-picture colony took that position. 
Mr. FERRER. All right, sir; then let us correct it.
Mr. JACKSON. Let us say a small "minority" of the colony and the industry.
Mr. WooD. Let me ask the witness, then: What activity did you exercise on behalf of such a move? 
Mr. FERRER. None whatever, sir. At the time I was in California there were two broadcasts given on subsequent Sundays-which is why I said a large part, Mr. Jackson-in which a great many stars and writers participated.
Mr. WOOD. What support did you give it ?
Mr. FERRER. I didn't give any, sir. I didn't participate in any way whatsoever.
Mr. KEARNEY. Were some of those writers later convicted?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know, sir, because the only writer that was con- victed that I ever met in my life was Ring Lardner, who was in college with me. I didn't know any of the other boys. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I did not ask that question with the idea of indicat- ing that you did not have the right to oppose this committee. 
Mr. FERRER. I know you didn't, Mr. Tavenner. I know you didn't.
Mr. TAVENNER. But I want to know what your action was and the reason for it. In that connection, let me call your attention to some further information that we have on that subject. On March 23, 1948, about 1,000 writers and actors had a meeting at the Hotel Astor, at which was formed, so we understand, an anticensorship committee, which was instructed to carry out a strong campaign on a national scale against the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, against the Tenney committee, of California,  and to fight against what was known as the Dewey plan of establishing a similar committee in New York State. You were alleged to be one of the speakers at this gathering.
Mr. FERRER. I introduced several people, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us how that organization was formed.
Mr. FERRER. This was in the spring of 1948; was it not ?
Mr. TAVENNER. 1948; yes, sir.
Mr. FERRER. To the best of my recollection, I was either phoned- I think I was probably phoned and told that this meeting was going to be held, and the names of some of the people who were going to be presentMr. TAVENNER. Who phoned you ?
Mr. FERRER. I don't know. I don't remember, Mr. Wood. (.Continuing) : were going to be present were given to me. Among these names was Moss Hart. And because I like and admire Mr. Hart, and because all of us in the theater are against censorship, I agreed to appear.
Mr. KEARNEY. Not because you were in favor of the abolishment of this committee?
Mr. FERRER. I didn't know enough about the committee to be in favor of the abolishment of the committee as a whole, Mr. Kearney. I was more opposed to forms of activity, and censorship was the issue at this particular point.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you were also concerned with the raising of funds for the defense of the 19 who had been subpenaed before this committee, at that meeting?
Mr. FERRER. I don't believe I was concerned with that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, that was the business of the meeting, was it not, in part ? 
Mr. FERRER. I remember that I introduced a painter and I introduced a writer, and I also said that I could not exist as an actor or as an artist if my art were controlled and if I were told how to do things and what to do. I said that the very essence of being an artist is liberty, is freedom, and that, therefore, like a great many people in the arts, I was opposed to censorship. That was the extent of my interest in the matter, and that is what I said, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. Right here, I am anxious to ask you a question right along that line. 
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. We have information to the effect that you were one of a number of people who sent greetings to the Moscow Art Theater, on November 1, 1948.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you do that because of the same love that you expressed and the same necessity for freedom in the practice of your art and your profession ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I did it for entirely different reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the reason?
Mr. FERRER. The reason was that this was the birthday of the Moscow Art Theater, and the Moscow Art Theater is the cradle of some of the most important developments of our modern theater. The Mos- 572 cow Art Theater was the home of one of the greatest directorial geniuses the theater has ever known, Stanislawsky. It was in the Moscow Art Theater that the plays of Anton Chekov first saw the light of day. Several great actors have developed in the Moscow Art Theater. And on a cultural plane only, and completely divorced from any political implication, when I was asked;. "Would you send a telegram to the Moscow Art Theater, saying, 'Congratulations on your fif- tieth'-or whatever it was-'birthday, ' " I said, "Yes." I would like to say-I would like to submit here a telegram from a gentleman you may have heard of, Mr. Lawrence Langner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you spell that, please?
Mr. FERRER. L-a-n-g-n-e-r. 
Mr. Langner is one of the directors of the Theater Guild, and also an extremely prominent patent attorney all over this country and in Europe. Mr. Langner is a very serious, very thoughtful businessman; a man who is not nearly as trifling as I am-because it has a bearing on what we are talking about.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before you submit that, let me finish my point.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. All of the great things which you attribute to the Russian theater, were things that were done earlier than 1934 and1935; is not that true ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir; that is true, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Had you taken the pains to study or to understand what had happened to the artists and the people of your profession in Russia since that date?
Mr. FERRER. May I submit this in answer ?
Mr. TAVENNER. All right, if it has a bearing on it.
Mr. FERRER. It has a very definite bearing, sir. Do you want me to read it?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. WooD. Suppose you read it.
Mr. FERRER. In answer to a request from my counsel, Mr. Reiskind, for an affidavit regarding Mr. Lawrence Langner's impression of my character and my Americanism, he wired back: Flying to Europe; hence unable to prepare affidavit. To the best of my knowledge, Josd Ferrer is loyal to this country and has expressed himself to me as being opposed to communism. This came up in discussion regarding Soviet interference with creative artists in the theater. Regards. LAWRENCE LANGNEB. 
Mr. TAVENNER. But yet you were congratulating the Moscow Theater.
Mr. FERRER. I would congratulate the Moscow Theater in the same way, Mr. Tavenner, that I would disapprove of the discontinuance of, say, playing the music of Wagner while we were at war with Germany. The Moscow Art Theater, to those of us who are in the theater, is a symbol of something, and this is a congratulation, in my mind, completely and totally divorced from any political implications. I repeat that -I have never had any sympathy for anything communistic, and this conversation that Mr. Langner refers to I had completely forgotten until he mentioned it.
Mr. JACKSON. That is in the nature of being a character reference, is it not?  INDUISRY 573 But the fact remains that he said I am opposed to communism and "this came up in discussion reMr. FERRER. Maybe so, Mr. Jackson. garding Soviet interference with creative artists in the theater." Which is what we were discussing before; which is why I mentioned it. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When did that discussion take place?
Mr. FERRER. It must have been when I was working for him in the Silver Whistle, which was the season of 1948 to 1949; sometime in that period.
Mr. VELDE. You mentioned a moment ago that someone asked you to send this congratulatory telegram. Who was the person?
Mr. FERRER. I believe it was Margaret Webster.
Mr. VELDE. Who is she? 
Mr. FERRER. She was the director of Othello, for the Theater Guild. She is an extremely prominent director in the theater.
Mr. TAVENNER. The January 10, 1949, issue of the Daily Worker contains an article, from which it appears that you were one of several who signed an invitation to a peace conference to be held March 25 through 27, 1949, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, sponsored by the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions. Did you sign the invitation?
Mr. FERRER. I do not remember signing the invitation, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, you held all of these various positions with the Arts, Sciences, and Professions.
Mr. FERRER. Yes. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name was used, as we have seen here.
Mr. FERRER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Many, many times.
Mr. FERRER. Yes sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. (ertainly there must be-some answer other than the fact you do not remember.
Mr. FERRER. The answer is probably my carelessness, Mr. Tavenner. I don't deny these things. If you ask me if I remember, I cannot tell you I remember. But I have told you time and again that I think it is probable that my name was used justifiably. I am not sure in this case, but I do know that the opening day of the conference I was in the Waldorf-Astoria-I broke throughwhich was picketed. The conference took place in the WaldorfAstoria and I was in the Waldorf-Astoria. And although I was invited to the conference the opening day, I was to a party given for Ed Sullivan that night by the Circus Saints and Sinners, and I was a guest of Mr.'Rutgers Nielsen, of RKO Pictures. My connection with this conference, whether my name was used, or not, was a nonexistent one, because I never attended the conference.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you ever repudiate the use of your name by any of these organizations?
Mr. FERRER. No; I did not, sir. And I wish I had now, because I may say that one reason that I didn't, aside from my natural inertia and my greater interest in my work, because of the fact that at that time I was an actor. Now, an actor in New York today, the way the theater is set up, is a kind of floating individual. He works for a company until the show closes, then he looks around for another job. 574 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY Today I am no longer an actor. Today I am a producer, I am a director. I have my own office; I have my own press-relations staff. When I want something to go to the press I have the channels and the personnel to accomplish it today. When I was in the Silver Whistle, which was 1949, I was an actor who had terrible financial losses to recoup, and I did not have to hand, to immediate hand-I cold have secured the means-I did not have it at hand, and I just let things slide. Today I would not do that because I have the machinery within my own office to take care of these things. Also, I have learned a rather bitter lesson, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. In other words, am I to understand that if you had to .do it over again you would not allow your name to be connected with any of these organizations ?
Mr. FERRER. That is right, sir. I wauld not allow my name to be used by any organization that was a Communist organization, that I knew to be a Communist front, a Communist affiliated, Communist anything. And I have learned the hard way that there are agencies that inform you on these things, and I intend to avail myself of them in the future because I still believe in the principles that I had in mind. I believe in helping people who need help if their cause is a worthy one, and I regret that I have been careless in so doing. But I do not regret the impulse, and I intend to maintain the impulse under more careful circumstances in the future.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you still believe in the abolishment of the House Un-American Activities Committee?
Mr. FERRER. No, I do not. I do think the House Un-American Activities Committee today is not only fulfilling an extremely important function, which I know that the FBI has been doing all along, but I know they are doing it in a way which I consider much more fair, much more decent; and I am now opposed to abolishment.
Mr. KEARNEY. When did you change your mind on that score ?
Mr. FERRER. Well, today, among other things. 
Mr. KEARNEY. In other words, since the subpena was issued ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes; because I was not very much aware of the activity of the House Un-American Activities Committee personally until the subpena was issued.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you make a study of it since that time?
Mr. FERRER. To a certain extent; yes, sir. Superficial, as usual, but a study. - Mr. KEARNEY. Then, according to your own testimony, it must be favorable.
Mr. FERRER. Yes; it is favorable, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I reserve final judgment on it. 
Mr. FERIER. Well, of this moment, Mr. Jackson, I cannot see into the future.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Ferrer, in a report by this committee, of April 19, 1949, a rather lengthy report relating to the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, that organization was described as a "super mobilization of the inveterate wheel horses and supporters of the Communist Party and its auxiliary organizations."  575 The report described the purposes of this conference, which the record shows you to have indorsed or sponsored, to be: 1. To provide propagandist forum against the Marshall plan, the North Atlantic Pact, the American foreign policy in general; 2. To promote support for the foreign policy of the Soviet Union; 3. To mobilize American intellectuals in the field of arts, sciences, and letters behind this program, even to the point of civil disobedience against the American Government; 4. To prepare the way for the coming world peace conference to be held In Paris on April 20 to 23, 1949, with similar aims in view on a world scale under similar Communist auspices; 5. To discredit American culture and to extol the virtues of the Soviet culture. Is your knowledge of the work of that conference such that you recognized that the conference had those purposes ?
Mr. FERRER. If I had ever heard that the purpose of this conference was to discredit American culture or to advocate-I don't remember the exact wording-but disregard for the American Government, I would have been extremely loud and unpleasant in opposition. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you take any steps to at that time ascertain what its true purposes were?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir. And one reason I didn't take any steps was that I don't believe I ever authorized the use of my name, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you taken any steps to repudiate your written sponsorship ofMr. FERRER. Did I?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. FERRER. NO; I did not, sir. I tried to answer that question to
Mr. Kearney a few moments ago.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you know that your name was being used in that -connection ?
Mr. FERRER. I probably did, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. The newspaper accounts contained rather extensive coverage of the conference.
Mr. FERRER. Yes. Yes; I think I did know. I would like to say, Mr. Jackson, that it presents a problem, as I say, to an actor who hasn't got the machinery set up around him how to repudiate it. If you write a letter to the people involved with your name on the letterhead, your name has been used. The damage has been done; they will probably disregard it. In those days I had not made very many motion pictures. I was not anywhere as near prominent as I am today, and if I had made some kind of a public statement to the effect, it probably would have been thrown in the wastebasket. That was my feeling.
Mr. JACKSON. Of course, Mr. Ferrer, the thing that is perplexing many people is the fact that your situation at that particular time was not in the slightest degree unusual. The situation in which an artist was importuned to permit the use of his name was one which was shared by hundreds of artists in all fields of the cultural arts, hundreds of men and women upon whose names and characters no taint of suspicion has ever been cast. Your case was not at all unusual when considered in the same light and the same period during which the Cary Grants, Randolph Scotts, and John Waynes were climbing the success ladder. There were literally scores of others who avoided these pitfalls. 576 Somehow or other these artists kept themselves from being placed in the situation where they eventually became suspect because of their activities. So your situation is not at all unusual, Mr. Ferrer, because of the fact that you did not have the physical mechanics at hand to counteract the unauthorized use of your name. Neither did the others.
Mr. FERRER. I know John Wayne and I know Cary Grant, and believe me, these men, when you get to be that successful and that prominent, you have either, through the studio or through your staff of secretaries-because when you are that successful and that well known, .you have to have all kinds of machinery to dispose of, which a stage actor just never, never needs or can afford for that matter.
Mr. JACKSON. Of course, there are on the legitimate stage in New York a number of actors and actresses who, during that same period were in very like situations. I mean that they were "top names." They were not people who were drawing down large salaries. They were people who, like yourself, were coming up the ladder and who were subject to the same pressures and the same unauthorized use of their names as you were.
Mr. FERRER. I agree that I should have, Mr. Jackson. I am not arguing that point. I was just offering one more weak excuse.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been honorary president of the Casa de Puerto Rico of the International Workers' Order?
Mr. FERRER. I have a letter in my files, Mr. Tavenner, which I wrote. I believe I was on tour. Was I? I was out of town. Anyway, I wrote a letter to my lawyer, Mr. Arthur Friend, who is now dead, I am sorry to say, in which I said: I see by letterhead that I have been honorary member of this thing, and this is the first I have heard of it. It comes to me as a considerable surprise. This was done again completely without my authorization or anything of the sort, and this I have a record of. I don't have it with me [addressing Mr. Fortas]. Do you?
Mr. KEARNEY. When you wrote down your surprise, did you repudiate it ?
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I did not repudiate it. I know it was to be that.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke this morning of the Theatre Authority and Mr. Correlli, Alan Correlli
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Who is the head of the
Mr. FERRER. Was.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Who was the head of it? Is he the same person who was a character witness in behalf of Larry Adler and Paul Draper in Connecticut, in the libel suit trial that was held not long ago?
Mr. FERRER. I think so.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you familiar with his testimony at that trial?
Mr. FERRER. When was the trial, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. April 4, 1950.
Mr. FERRER. No, sir; I am not familiar. I was in California at the time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any suggestion that you would like to make about the use of Communist-front organizations in your pro- / fession?  577 
Mr. FERRER. A suggestion to whom, sir ? 
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee, as to how Communist-front organizations may be made less dangerous in your profession, or may be put upon a basis whereby the innocent members of your profession might well avoid pitfalls?
Mr. FERRER. I have one suggestion, sir. And maybe this has been done already, but if it hasn't been done, it should be done more, and that is: I think it is extremely important that in theatrical circles. and in the entertainment profession it be highly publicized the availability of this committee and the Attorney General's office rapidly toinform any member of the profession who wants instruction. I think that this service exists. Does it not? But I don't think the people know about it. I think that if they knew, "We can go in and find out," if they had a place that they knew is set up just to help us out, to keep us out of this trouble, next tomaking it illegal, the Communist Party and all Communist activity-which would be the thing that I think would be the biggest help of all-I think some kind of a center where people who want information and want help can get it and can receive a welcome when they come asking questions and can get it rapidly so they can answer quickly when they ask a question, and the publicizing of this would be a tremendous help to you people and to all of us. I think it is a matter of public relations, for the members of the entertainment profession to be aware that it is their duty to find out and to tell them to go where to find out.
Mr. KEARNEY. In a situation like that, would it not also be true that you would have those who want to believe who would believe?
Mr. FERRER. That would be a big step in the right direction, wouldn't it, Mr. Kearney, to know who they were?
Mr. KEARNEY. Yes. But certain members of not only your profession, but of other organizations have their own ideas about what you were talking about, and even if a hundred-point proof was placed in front of them, they still would not believe it.
Mr. FERRER. Except that I think there is nothing like draggingsomething out into the open and exposing it to air; the examples set, let us say, by the few who use this service, or who may use this service, or used it and disregarded it, who are lonelier and lonelier and who would be finally left not in a large group such as I was, but fallingby themselves and having to face alone this responsibility.
Mr. KEARNEY. That is what this committee has been doing for years, and even on your admission you did not believe it until only a few days ago.
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir. And that is why I say it is a public relations job to advise them to avail themselves, that they have this committee to avail themselves, and to have a place to go and get these questions answered.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Ferrer, what possible course of action could this committee, or any other agency, take in advertising the fact that May Day is an international Communist celebration ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Jackson, you must remember I was asked a question. and I am trying my best to answer. I am offering suggestions.
Mr. JACKSON. I am not asking facetious questions. I mean what process of added information can we pursue when the entire press of the Nation81595-51-pt. 3---4 578 
Mr. FERRER. I think that is no longer necessary.
Mr. JACKSON. What possible course can we take, as far as artists are concerned, in instances where they support, knowingly or unknowingly, Communist candidates for public office ? That is a very personal matter which requires self-investigation. No committee can or should control those arts.
Mr. FFRRER. That is perfectly true. On political matters there is absolutely no question.
Mr. JACKSON. The whole essence of this investigation is political. The whole thing is a political situation.
Mr. FERRER. I think we have all learned a lot in the last few months, sir. I certainly have, Mr. Jackson. If the question ever comes up before me, I am going to very strongly advise people to find out and to tell them that this committee exists and they shouldMr. KEARNEY. Why wait until the question comes before you ? Why not start now ?
Mr. FERRER. Mr. Kearney, I will ask you for a few suggestions. If you tell me how, I will be glad to. I will. I am talking about other people-if it comes up in conversation, I mean.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Ferrer, many of the people with whom your name, advertently or inadvertently, has been associated, have appeared in the same chair in which you are now seated. That particular group is not going to require it at all, because they are fully informed as to what this committee is doing and the information it is attempting to obtain.
Mr. FERRER. I mean younger members in the theater, young newcomers in the theater, that I come in contact with. They say, "Joe, how did you make out today ? What are you going to do in the future ?" and so on. I will tell them. Obviously, those are my juniors. Others will know better, those who didn't before. I think the youth, the people who are becoming the tomorrow of the theater, I think there is where we can all be very useful, because I think it is important that the motives that prompted this should not die, and I think it is important that the method that we employ be better.
Mr. JACKSON. May I ask one more question, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. WooD. The counsel informs me that he is finished with all the questions he has to ask. So I will yield to you now.
Mr. JACKSON. I simply wanted to carefully cover one sore point. Do I understand Mr. Ferrer, that you advocate and endorse the outlawing of the Communist Party?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir; I do. Definitely. Emphatically. In dealing with it-Mr. JACKSON. Would you assign a reason for your belief in that connection ? Why do you think it should be outlawed ?
Mr. FERRER. Because, through conversations, investigation, and research that I have done because of the subpena and my appearance here, I have been convinced and it has been pointed out to me irrefutably that the Communist Party of America is the instrument, definitely, of a foreign government; that its aims are those of a foreign government, and have nothing to do with our own life or our own welfare.  INIDUSTfRY 570 And the mere fact that it is un-American seems to me to make it ipso facto illegal. I think that it would be simpler and more clear-cut if the Communist Party was an outlaw and there would be right black or white, one or the other. I am not an expert in legal matters, but this is my unprofessional opinion. 
Mr. WooD. I know the witness is probably tired, and so is the reporter. It has been a rather long day. If you desire to interrogate the witness at some length, it might be well to adjourn until tomorrow. Do you have some questions to ask, too, Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. And you, too, Mr. Kearney ?
Mr. KEARNEY. Y es.
Mr. WOOD. I appreciate the fact that we have been here long today and I certainly do not want people to get too tired. If it is agreeable to the witness to remain over until the morning, the witness can meet us back here at 10 o'clock, instead of 10:30.
Mr. FERRER. I am supposed to play a matinee tomorrow afternoon,
Mr. Wood.
Mr. WOOD. Where ? 
Mr. FERRER. In New York City. 
Mr. WOOD. At what time?
Mr. FERRER. I should be in the theater by 2:15, 2 o'clock.
Mr. WooD. Would that mean, then, that you should get away from here this evening ?
Mr. FERRER. I have a play tonight. Yes, sir. I have to catch a plane and I am giving a performance tonight.
Mr. WooD. At what time tonight?
Mr. FERRER. I should be in the theater by 8 o'clock.
Mr. WOOD. What time does your plane leave ?
Mr. FERRER. Five o'clock is the reservation I have. But I would be glad to take a later plane, or do whatever you gentlemen suggest.
Mr. WooD. What is the latest plane you could get that would get you there in time ? It is 4 o'clock now. What day would suit you, Mr. Ferrer, to return here for the questions that the other members of the committee may desire to ask you?
Mr. FERRER. Thursday, or Friday, Mr. Wood, if you don't think we can do so now.
Mr. WooD. I am apprehensive and some of the members have indi- cated that their questioning may consume a little time. I am apprehensive that we would not be able to finish here before 5 o'clock this evening. And I am speaking for myself only now, but I have not had a chance to read my own mail today. The rest can answer for themselves. I think we should have a little time. Can you return, then, at 10:30 Friday morning, Mr. Ferrer ?
Mr. FERRER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WOOD. I will say for the benefit of the members of the com- mittee particularly that it would be impossible for me to be here Friday, but I am going to ask Mr. Walter to take over. Also, I think because of the absences here we had better maintain the same schedule so that I can be sure to have it. 580 INDUSTRY You may be excused, then, Mr. Ferrer, until Friday morning at 10:30.
Mr. FERRER. Friday morning at 10:30. Thank you, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WooD. The committee will stand in recess until 10:30 o'clock tomorrow morning. (Thereupon, at 4 p. m., the committee recessed, to reconvene at 10: 30 a. m., Wednesday, May 23, 1951.) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 3 WEDNESDAY, MAY 23, 1951 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE OF UN-AMERICAN ATIVITIrES, Washington, D.
