Mr. WEREB. Stephen A. Wereb.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is noted that you are not accompanied by counsel. You are familiar with the rule of the committee, are you not, that you are entitled to counsel if you so desire?
Mr. WEREB. I am, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell your name, please.
Mr. WEREB. W-e-r-e-b. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Wereb ?
Mr. WEREB. I was born at Alpha, N. J., April 27, 1898.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you presently reside in Los Angeles County ?
Mr. WEREB. I do, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you resided in Los Angeles County 
Mr. WEREB. Thirty- five years, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been?
Mr. WEREB. I have had grade-school education, high-school education, and I have had 1 year of business and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania. 1780 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation ?
Mr. WEREB. At the present time I own and operate the Weber Typewriter Service.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you had occasion in the past to be employed by any investigative branch of the Federal Government?
Mr. WEREB. I have, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of that employment?
Mr. WEREB. I worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation as an undercover agent.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, how it happened that you were employed in that capacity ? 
Mr. WEREB. My attention first to subversive talks, literature, activities, was drawn by leaflets, speeches, and aggressiveness and the proRussian attitude of certain people along my stops, and this alarmed me to such an extent that I took the necessary steps to inquire further, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by saying "along your stops"?
Mr. WEREB. During my work at the Typewriter Service, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to your being employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had you been affiliated in any manner with the Communist Party?
Mr. WEREB. I had not, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you testified prior to today on the subject of communism?
Mr. WEREB. I have, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. In what courts or before what bodies did you testify?
Mr. WEREB. I have testified at the Smith Act trials of Schneider- man v. the United States Government in 1953, I believe, and then I appeared before this committee in San Diego last year.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was for a limited purpose at San Diego, I believe.
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You did not at that time testify generally about your knowledge of Communist Party activities in the Los Angeles County area? 
Mr. WEREB. I did not. 
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of being employed by the Federal Bu- reau of Investigation, did you seek admission to the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of what appears to be a Communist Party card. Will you identify it, please? (Document handed to the witness.)
Mr. WEREB. This was my membership book in the Hawthorne group of the Communist Party in 1944.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it issued to you by the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. It was issued to me by the membership director at that time, one Vernon L. Potter, at my home, who identified himself as the membership chairman of that group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine the card and state whether or not it shows the name of the person who was the owner of the book?
Mr. WEREB. It does.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name?
Mr. WEREB. S. A. Weber. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1781 
Mr. TAVENNER. S. A. Weber? 
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name is Wereb ?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that your party name ? 
Mr. WEREB. It was used during my membership in the party, but this name has been published in the Daily News-not the Daily News, but the Legal Daily, for the purpose of doing business under the name of Weber Typewriter Service and it was at the behest and suggestion of some of my accounts. Therefore, I took legal steps to change it to that only doing business.
Mr. TAVENNER. But that is the name in the Communist Party by which you registered?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct; they never knew my real name.
Mr. TAVENNER. During what period of time did you work within the Communist Party for the Federal Bureau of Investigation ?
Mr. WEREB. Approximately from October of 1943 until the 1st of January or thereabouts of 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. What prompted you to undertake an assignment of that character?
Mr. WEREB. Well, sir, my people came from Europe-they came from a place of oppression-and I was born here and I just could not quite understand the stories that I heard from immigrants and other people who have taken refuge here, what a wonderful place this is, and how anyone could attempt to use force or violence to try to overthrow or even subversion to overthrow this type of government, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. That motivated you in undertaking this difficult assignment?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. During the course of these years which you gave to work within the Communist Party, did you find it to be a difficult assignment and one which influenced your life during that period of time?
Mr. WEREB. The only influence I have ever had with my association-that is, through the association of the Communist Party-was a greater love that I have for the country, because of their teaching, of their unacceptable philosophy, of their impossible attitude, and the continuous mistrust of one another-the revolutionary tendencies. In other words, if I did have, shall we say, such a thought as a progressive thought ever in my bones, which I don't believe I ever had, that certainly would have cured me.
Mr. TAVENNER. In what sense do you use the term "progressive"?
Mr. WEREB. I mean that as the Communist Party uses it. There are times that it is more applicable to use that you are a progressive rather than a Communist, wherever the case may fit. For instance, if you are an active person in the union, they do not exactly relish the idea of you standing out there as a Communist but they would rather have you there as a "progressive" person; or if you are active in any politics of any kind, they try and avert the Communist approach from anything, but what they try to do is use the words "progressive," "democratic," "democracy." They drag that around just like a dirty rug.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there anything of significance that occurred within a few months prior to the time you actually became a member of the Communist Party in carrying out your assignment which would be of value to the committee? 1782 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WEREP.. Just the sort of an explanation of how hard it is to get into this group. In other words, I tried wholeheartedly, I attended every function advertised in the Peoples Daily World and everywhere where I might have met some of these "progressive" people, I have attended every function and it took meMr. TAVENNER. In using the term "progressive," are you using it in quotation marks?
Mr. WEREB. In quotation marks-still the same men, still the same answer as in the previous answer, sir. I tried my very best, visited book stores at that time known as the progressive book shop, and there Marxist literature of all types was to be had; guides as to how to be a good Communist; Lenin's works, Stalin's works, and I managed to read up on those the best I could until I was finally approached to join the party at one of the functions, but it was a 3-month chore.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, who it was that approached you to interest you in becoming a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. In the month of January in 1944 a Wilhelmina Mase, whom I knew for a long time as a functionary and as one of the fulltime workers at the Peoples Daily World, approached me and signed me up for the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is the proper spelling of the name M-a-i-s-e?
Mr. WEREK. That is as far as I can remember, sir.
Mr. TAVENN ER. Will you proceed to describe what occurred.
Mr. WEREB. At this party there were approximately two to three hundred people present. It was held at 2200 West Seventh Street and it was held by the West Lake group, at that time known as the West Lake Club of the Communist Party. They had a lot of drinking, they had an affair called their social. It was a celebration of an officers' installation. At that time Willamena Maise was also installed as the chairman of the West Lake group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was it that actually gave you your Communist Party card, the photostatic copy of which I exhibited to you ?
Mr. WERER. A person known to me by the name of Vernon L. Potter came to my home and I identified myself and he identified himself as the membership chairman of the Hawthorne Conununist group, and he gave me my membership card and also my first assignment.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that assignment?
Mr. WEREB. My first assignment was, sir, to attend a function known also as an installation affair at the home of one John and Georgiana Garrish. I think the address-I am not sure of the number, but it was on Paseo de Gracia in Redondo.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the spelling?
Mr. WEREn. G-a-r-r-i-s-h.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is the party's name?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was any security measure taken to ascertain your future reliability by the Communist Party at the time you entered the Communist Party, or was any such security measure taken at a later date?
Mr. WEREB. Security measures of that type were taken at a later date. I was closely watched and sent to workers' school the first time before I was integrated into the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state again briefly what this first assignment was? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1783 
Mr. WEREB. This first assignment was for me to attend this inauguration affair on Paseo de Gracia at the home of Garrish, and there the new elected or-well, I would not say elected, but dictated officers of the club were introduced. I imagine there were 40 or 45 people there. At that time I did not know too many, but I did identify Vernon Potter, John Houston. the Garrish family, and Juanita Smith. I do not recall at the present time any more names that I would remember because that was my first affair. At this party, of course after the introductions finally, a man by the name of John Houston was introduced, brought out from one of the side rooms, and he came in and they introduced him as the chairman, the new chairman of the Hawthorne-Inglewood Communist group.
Mr. TAVENNER. This was a meeting of the Hawthorne group of the Communist Party
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir There was no official meeting known as-like the other meetings that consist of Marxist class or an educational period. There was no educational period but there were some guessing games played such as what Lenin did and who Engels was, and then they gave prizes, maybe, of a sandwich or so or gave you a little extra pamphlet if you had the right answers. I had no answers because I did not know anything about them. Then there was this man Houston. When he was introduced to the crowd of 50 people or 40 people, he expressed his feeling of gratitude to the crowd and stated at that time that if we had been reading the papers, Russia at that time was divided into 16 separate countries and if we worked hard enough in the United States of America, we-that is, the Communists-we could make this country the 17th state or country of the Soviet Union.
Mr. TAVENNE. Do you recall his first name, Houston's first name?
Mr. WEREB. John.
Mr. TAVESNNER. Did you become well acquainted with Mr. Houston in your future connection with the Hawthorne Group of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. We became personal acquaintaneces, sir. I met him on the average of, oh, I would say, 3 times a month or sometimes 5 times a month. It would all depend on the assignments and the meetings that we held.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask a question here, please. You mean that right here in Hawthorne and Los Angeles County, Hawthorne being, as I remember it-maybe it is part of the city limits of Los Angeles now; I don't know. But I know it is right next door to the city limits of Los Angeles on the south. You mean right there in our midst this man was preaching and advocating that your Communist cell work hard toward the objective of making the United States of America the 17th state of the Soviet Union ?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. It is not a laughing matter, I am sure, for folks who may be in the room; nothing funny about it.
Mr. SCHERER. Were we going to get a star?
Mr. WEREB. I do not know, sir. No star was mentioned.
Mr. DOYLE. How many would be at a meeting like that ?
Mr. WEREB. At that meeting I believe there were 40 or 50 people, but outside of the names I have already called, I could not identify more 1784 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA because I did not know any more. That was my first function and first assignment.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you know at what level of authority in the Communist Party Houston came from I
Mr. WEREB. He was a chairman, and to become a chairman of any Communist group you must have the approval of the county officers and the county officers usually know and approve all candidates. For instance, at one time I was elected a membership director but the county kind of did not think that was the proper thing to do, so they unelected me very quickly within 2 months. In other words, I was not given any records at that time of any members or membership. I was not given any authority like the other membership directors had, and there was nothing done at club level that was not dictated by the county Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. How did you know they unelected you? Did they tell you so?
Mr. WEREB. Well, yes, sir; I believe I was told that Edith Smith, who has been the membership director up until that time, would be the proper person for that job. I was not directly told, but I was not trusted; but I could read between the lines that-well, they were not sure.
Mr. DOYLE. How old a man would you estimate this fellow Houston to be that was speaking apparently with the authority of the Communist County Committee in Los Angeles County when he said the objective was to work to have the United States of America the 17th state of the Soviet Union? How old a man would he be?
Mr. WEREB. I would say at that time approximately 36 to 38 years old.
Mr. DOYLE. He was not a child, then, and he was not in his dotage?
Mr. WEREB. No, sir. He was a well-educated man.
Mr. DOYLE. In this meeting room at Inglewood, the Communist Club or cell where it met, what decorations did they have so far as pictures, if any, of people or-of course, they had the flag of the United States up, did they not?
Mr. WYEREB. No, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. They did not? 
Mr. WEREB. NO, sir. This was at a home of Mr. and Mrs. Garrish.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you ever see a flag of the United States at any Communist cell meeting?
Mr. WEREB. I believe at one time at the Embassy Auditorium they had one underneath the balcony in a little hidden corner, but it was a flag that was small and there were so many large Commumist posters up that you certainly would have to be a trickster to see the American flag.
Mr. DOYLE. What kind of posters were up ?
Mr. WEREB. Money drives for membership and money drives for defense, money drives for fighting different Congressmen.
Mr. DOYLE. Did they have any pictures of Stalin or any of rest of the Communist leaders? The reason I ask you that questionthe is that in many of our hearings we have evidence under oath by former bona fide Communists the fact that they never display an American flag in their club meetings or cells but they almost always have a picture in their established club rooms, if they are such, of Stalin and Engels COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1785 and these other Communists leaders but never any of distinguished Americans.
Mr. WEREB. I have never seen Stalin's picture, with the exception at the Embassy Auditorium and at the Shrine Auditorium at one time. The rest of the times our group always met at different homes and under different circumstances. We tried never to meet twice in the same place.
Mr. SCHERER. When you say you saw a picture at the Shrine Auditorium, is that when the Communists had rented the auditorium and were conducting the meeting ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir. I am sorry if you misunderstood.
Mr. SCHERER. I did not misunderstand, I wanted the record clear.
Mr. WEREB. Thank you.
Mr. DOYLE. If they had Stalin's picture on those occasions, they must have had the picture of some President of the United States right alongside, did they not?
Mr. WEREB. They may have, but at the present time I do not recall.
Mr. DOYLE. You would be apt to recall it, would you not?
Mr. WEREB. I do not think I looked for the President's picture to be there, but if I did, I would have ignored the President's picture regardless of the circumstances because I have always considered the President of the United States to be a wonderful person, no matter who he was, and thought his picture might have been misused. At one time I think Mr. Truman's picture was up, but I do not recall where.
Mr. DOLE. I do not think we have had any testimony in any place in the country that any picture of any great American was displayed in any Communist cell meeting. That is the reason for my question, even though the pictures of Soviet great men were prominently displayed. Thank you, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Mr. John Houston give you any Communist Party assignments ?
Mr. WEREB. The very first assignment Mr. Houston gave me was to attend a workers school. This school I did attend, and it was conducted in a building on Third Street between Spring and Broadway. At the present time I do not know the name of this building, but it was on the second floor. There were no markings on the doors, but I did see a number of people in the evening going into these places. So I followed one of the bunches-that is, one of the groups-and I went into this class. There were 10 weeks of this Marxist class.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were the instructors?
Mr. WEREB. The first class I attended, sir, was taught by a man named Max Silver and he taught the advanced Marxist sciences, as they called it, or Communist program, and-well, they asked me a question and I felt kind of stupid because I did not know what they were talking about. They asked me how long had I been a Communist, and I told them I had just joined and been assigned to this school. He said, "Did you ever learn Marxism or communism?" and I said, "No." He said, "You go across the hall and there is another teacher, Emily Gordon, and she will teach all the beginners." Then I attended the rest of the nine sessions under the tutelage of
Miss Gordon. 1786 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have any further Communist Party in- struction or schooling ?
Mr. WEREB. I have had about 35 different classes that I attended during my membership in the Communist Party, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe them in just a general way?
Mr. WEREB. The Peoples Educational Center.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend that at the instruction of the Communist Party?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. I was told to go there by Emily Gordon andMr. TAVENNER. Was that school being operated by the Communist Party?
Mr. WEREB. Well, the only way I could explain that to you, sir, to be frank, is that they did not want to be known as Communists, but the Communist Party gave them all their papers, all their typewriters, all the equipment, all the money, and the teachers. That I know to be true, sir, because I helped transfer some of the typewriters and some of the instructive literature which were of Communist nature into this school. I believe there were two teachers there. One was known as William Wolf. They introduced him as a member of the party from New York. Then there was one John Howard Lawson who was the other instructor that I met and I knew there.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say you attended 35 classes. Do you mean by that a different teaching group?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir. You see, the policy of the party isthat is, it was at that time-that Marxism and Leninism and bolshevism would be the prime and the only objective. Therefore, there would be refresher courses that would average 4 to 5 a year and they would be, say, classes of 4, classes of 5-that is, a series of 4 or 5 is what I meant-and they, especially the leadership, would be instructed to attend these meetings. These meetings ordinarily were held by full-time county functionaries, such as the educational directors or working from the educational director of the Communist Party of Los Angeles County, sometimes the State: and then there were functionaries' schools, preparatory schools. To become a functionary, I have attended some of those, sir. They are too numerous to mention.
Mr. DOYLE. What year was that ?
Mr. WEREB. This is all between the year of 1944, January, and 1948. That is, the first of January 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there any substantial difference in the type of instruction that was received from January 1944 up until 1948? 
Mr. WEREB. Yes. The classes that were conducted directly by the party were of more revolutionary nature than conducted by the Peoples Educational Center. This Peoples Educational Center class was sort of an introductory class to some who might be a prey or easy prey to communism. Eva Shafran-she is deceased at this time-she was a Russian citizen and here direct from Russia to teach this. Eva Shafran held some open classes to labor leaders and union members. I think this was at the second floor of the Embassy Auditorium, prior to my actu- ally becoming a member, during the time I tried to gain membership.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you attend any of those classes?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1787 
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were these classes generally held ?
Mr. WEREB. Most of the classes for the club members were held in homes of people who had been Marxists for quite a while. There were a number of classes held at the home of Lou Stark. I do not recall his address. Then there were a number of classes held at the home of Edith Smith, Mike Gorman-a number of classes held at William Kellas' home.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me stop you there a moment. In mentioning the names of these persons in whose homes the meetings were held, I want to know whether you knew those people to be members of the Communist Party.
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir, because these were all closed Communist affairs and you could not enter unless you were identified or you had some identification from the county as a representative, you were the instructor.
Mr. TAVENNER. Up to this point you have mentioned the name of
Mr. Louis Stark.
Mr. WEREB. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he known to you to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. He was a member of the Communist Party because I issued him, I believe in the year 1946 I issued the membership cards, and I believe that it is a record of the Government that I did issue that card.
Mr. TAVENNER. The second person that you named in whose home these meetings were held, I do not recall. Do you recall who the second one was?
Mr. T\EREB. Edith Smith or William Kellas.
Mr. TAVENNER. Both of those? 
Mr. WEREB. Edith Smith was the membership director of our group throughout most of the time. We had what they called club internal strife. That is where your distrust of 1 member of another and the accusation of 1member and another was continuous. We had continual turnover. Instead of a man serving in an office for a period of 1 year that he was supposedly elected to, he would probably serve 3 or 4 months and something would come along and they would change officers. Then the home of this William Kellas, who was known to me as a chairman, I believe on two occasions of our Communist group.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS the spelling K-e-l-l-a-s? 
Mr. WEREB. Correct, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask one question here? A few moments ago you said that some of these classes were more revolutionary in their nature and instruction than others. Do you remember saying that?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. 
Mr. DOYLE. In what way do you use the term "revolutionary"?
Mr. WEREB. May I call one class event to your attention, sir, with your permission? We had a teacher by the name of Elizabeth LeichMr. DOYLE. How do you spell it?
Mr. WEREB. Elizabeth L-e-i-c-h G-l-e-n-n. This woman was sent Comto us by the county educational committee, Los Angeles County munist Party Educational Committee. She was sent to teach us Marxism and Leninism, of course. During this class she spoke of the 1788 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA progress of Marxism and Leninism and how well it is and tried to sell the idea of the capitalists not owning tools and labor, having just labor, but the people should own everything and how eventually it would wind into an impossible situation. So one of the members of the class asked what she meant by that. She said, "Of course I mean that there would be a revolution," and she said this revolution would come about and there would be many people hurt, people get killed-including workers; there would be an overthrow of the Government, confiscation of private property. This woman, sir, was an official teacher of the Los Angeles County Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you hear her say that?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. I sat there and heard her say so.
Mr. DOYLE. Where did that occur ?
Mr. WEREB. That occurred at the home of Lou Stark.
Mr. DoYLE. About what year
Mr. WEREB. I would say the year of 1945, latter part of 1945 or first of 1946.
Mr. DOYLE. Was that a closed Communist Party meeting?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. About how many people were there ? 
Mr. WEREB. I believe I have notes. Would you like to hear them, sir? I believe I haveMr. DOYLE. I do not mean to take over your examination.
Mr. TAVENNER. I think since you asked that question he should answer.
Mr. DOYLE. I was interested in that one particular thing, that particular revolutionary matter.
Mr. TAVENNER. He should be allowed to refresh his recollection.
Mr. WEREB. I have notes.
Mr. DOYLE. When did you make those notes? 
Mr. WEREB. I made them regularly right after the meeting at the present time after I severed my connection with the partyand did manage to keep out a few little things for myself, and I do have Isome information which was not easy to get. I could give you this class and the people that were there. Yes; here it is, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Is there a date on those notes?
Mr. WEREB. No, sir, just general; no dates. Yes, it shows his teaching was-I beg your pardon. It was 1947, not 1946. when There were present at that time John Houston, Vernon Potter, Jack Karson Edith Smith, Lou Stark and his wife Mrs. Marion Stark. Mike Gorman and Ed Fitzgerald, I believe. There was a Lillian Frong.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that last name ?
Mr. WEREB. Lillian Frong, F-r-o-n-g, and Sam Chriss.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the spelling of Chriss? 
Mr. WEREB. C-h-r-i-s-s. That is phonetic, as close as I ever came to the correct spelling. Marion Stark is the first name of Mrs. Stark. Pauline Sullivan, Ida Karson, Chester Fein.
Mr. TAVENNER. F-e-i-n? 
Mr. WEnEn. Correct, sir; Adrienne Fein. And a man known to me by the name of Mel Wilkerson at that meeting, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask one more question, Counsel. At that particular class which you have mentioned when this woman was describing the revolutionary action that had to come or would COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1789 come in her judgment, what part, if any, was the Communist membership to play in the revolution? What were they to do?
Mr. WEREB. They were to be the prime and the ruling factor of this revolution, sir. They would guide it and that was one of the reasons they said the only way it could be done is having enough people in the labor unions who were Marxist trained and Marxist and eninist education and had the Stalin spirit, and those people were the people who would help put about tins program. That is at one of the classes. There were a number of classes of this nature, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say there were a number of classes of this nature ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, there were. I also recall another class that was held at the home of William Kellas. This man Kellas was known to me as a party member and by his own admission as far back as 1923 or 1924, at that time, was known by a different name. 
Mr. Kellas was a very, very well read and well educated Marxist and all his time and all his effort went into the Marxist education and teaching. He taught a class. I would have to refer to my notes as to when this was again, but I will give you a general idea of what they called a cadre class. This cadre class, I will manage to explain, is a class who is taught leadership. He most naturally was questioned as to what this-well, we only have one leadership, but at the present time what is it?-and he said this cadre class is for a leadership of five depth.
Mr. DOYLE. What?
Mr. WEREB. Five depth. Five labor chairmen, five literature directors, five of everything. If the Federal Bureau of Investigation decided or the Government decided to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest these people for subversive activities or trouble came along, the second group automatically would step right up. If the police or some other law-enforcement agency came along and arrested these people, the third would function and so on down the line until the five were exhausted, and by that time there would be a fruitful result of this turmoil that he was speaking of at that time.
Mr. SCHERER. They recognized, then, the possible illegality of their actions and their organization in setting up such an organization?
Mr. WEREB. They never doubted for one moment that they were an illegal and a revolutionary group, sir. If they thought for one moment that any member in that group did not have revolutionary ideas or was not progressing well enough in his Marxist teaching or his revolutionary tendencies, he did not stay very long. The party would manage to bounce him or kick him out.
Mr. DOYLE. As I understand it, right here in Los Angeles, in Hawthorne and other places, these Communist meetings and classes which you attended, this doctrine and philosophy which you have related was openly taught in secret meetings ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. What year was that?
Mr. WEREB. That was in August of 1946. I have that. I also have other classes to that effect, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. That was a year and a half or 2 years after Earl Browder was kicked out of the control of the American Communist Party because he believed that the two systems of economy could get 65500-55--pt. 4--2 1790 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA along side by side in the world. Didn't you ever hear anyone object to that sort of philosophy ?
Mr. WEREB. That they should get along?
Mr. DOYLE. No, this revolutionary philosophy. Didn't any of the American citizens present there ever object to that sort of instruction ?
Mr. WEREB. Mr. Doyle, with all apologies to this committee, I do not believe a Communist could be a citizen of this country because I do not believe that his allegiance would be strong enough to call himself a citizen, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. I agree with you, but then I am asking you now the question: Did you ever hear any American citizen object to this sort of teaching in any of these meetings?
Mr. WEREB. No, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Not even question them?
Mr. WEREB. No, sir; just as to procedure sometimes.
Mr. DOYLE. Was that the procedure whereby they were teaching that it would be necessary to arm sometimes, use arms and force?
Mr. WEREB. In order to use arms and force to shoot people, including workers, to have bloodshed you must have arms. The source of arms I never was told where it would come from, just how it would come about. I was never given that information, but I am sure there were others who did have that information. Do you want me to go on further with these classes, sir ?
Mr. TA ENNER. Let me ask you a question at that point. You spoke of Elizabeth Glenn being one of the instructors sent down from a higher level of the Communist Party. You have told us of the nature of the instructions she gave you. Can you tell us anything further about the instruction that she gave your group ?
Mr. WEREB. Elizabeth Leich Glenn taught a series of different classes. I mentioned to you the last, the most outstanding of all, and she of course taught Marxism, Leninism, the works of Stalin, wages and price, and actions of labor in strife. This is the type of education she taught. There were others that taught something different, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. Proceed.
Mr. WEREB. We had another series of classes at the home of Dan McComb. M-c-C-o-m-b, I believe. I would have to see the spelling. This man I knew to be a good Marxist, a good Commie. He worked hard for the party, and he also served as chairman of the Hawthorne Communist group and at his home we had a series of classes that was taught by a person named Harry Hay. This man Hay also identified himself to the group as being sent to our club as a teacher of MarxismLeinism by the county educational committee. He said that he was from the Eagle Rock district, and he also was an active Communist for a long time. This man spoke of the American system of elections whereby the American elections are just not right; they couldn't beit is a Fascist-like election system and it could not serve the masses. Hie taught that the Communist Party had a plan. For example, he would say the maritime union. He said, "Now there is a good example for you."
Mr. SCIIERER. What type of elections did he propose ?
Mr. WiuEE. The general elections of representatives like yourself sir, Government elections.
Mr. SciiEnER. Wliat type of elections did he propose ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1791 
Mr. WEREB. I am coming to that, sir. He said that you take your maritime union, for example, as a group. Those people are not in port most of the time. They are absent. Therefore, some of the absentee ballots never get in. What the party proposed at that time was to have one man of the Communist Party vote as a block for the maritime union. They questioned him somewhat as to the possibility of that, and he said that many places in the Soviet Union or in countries where they have a Bolshevik government such practices are common. In other words, instead of having the workers always come in and vote, they have one man cast the ballot for them as a blanket ballot. That was one of the series of classes. I have more.
Mr. SCHERER. Did they advocate any other system of voting?
Mr. TEREB. That system whereby one man votes for a group.
Mr. SCHERER. Did they advocate the proportional representation system of voting ?
Mr. WEREB. That was a Fascist idea.
Mr. SCHERER. Proportional representation?
Mr. WEREB. In other words, if you took a man from a certain district because he represented that district, that was not any good; that was a reactionary idea. But as one man, they would manage to pick and appoint and elect. Is that what you had reference to?
Mr. SCHERER. No, I do not think you quite understand what I mean by proportional representation system of voting, so I will just withdraw the question.
Mr. WEREB. All right.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask one question along a different line? I do not know what your answer may be because I have never discussed it with you. What did you see, if anything, in activity for or with children and young people, the teen-age in Los Angeles County ? Did you come in touch with that phase of the activities of the Communist Party? If so, what did you learn?
Mr. WEREB. The only phase of that I know, sir, is that they had one man by the name of Mayer Frieden.
Mr. DOYLE. How do you spell his last name ?
Mr. WEREB. F-r-i-e-d-e-n, I believe. The Mayer would be phonetic, M-e-y-e-r or M-a-v-e-r, I would not know. He had charge of the youth group at that time, Young Communist League, which became American Youth for Democracy. They tossed it around for some other name. I visited their office once or twice, but I do not recall that II was too busy with other assignments to get into the youth group, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Our hearings all over the country show they very actively endeavored to get activity among American youth and interest. In fact they established camps known as a pioneer group to counteract the influence of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
Mr. WEREB. That is true, because they were asked-I remember that they impressed the classes, especially on members, to have their children-at that time their policy was a little different. They would shift their policy at will any way they liked. At that time the policy was to get them into the YMCA, YWCA, church groups-any groups whereby they could influence. In fact, we, the senior members of the organization, also were requested to do so regardless of under what guise. It did not make any difference. We had a man by the name of George Sandy. He was a full-time functionary for the party, I guess during the WPA days and up. This 1792 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA man and I had personal meetings. , At the county offices we had meetings together. He met with our group a number of times, and he said, "Now you Communists, you have got one job to do-it does not make a bit of difference under what guise-you get into the general public, get there. If you have to pick on a sewer bond issue, pick on it; go from house to house. Don't tell them you are a Communist, tell them you are a citizen and you are interested, until you are well enough known whereby you can run for city council or whatever office that the public might think that you are fit for." And that was the program at one time.
Mr. DoYLE. Thank you very much. I must not take more of the counsel's time.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is all right, Mr. Chairman; it helps develop the picture. You were describing these various classes which you attended. I believe you said there were still others.
Mr. WEREB. Yes; there were. If you will excuse me a moment, I do have one more I jotted down here that I would like to call the committee's attention to, to one other class here. Elizabeth Leich Glenn had a series of classes with us and she spoke of manpower. She said, "Well, it is hardly possible to recruit that many men into the Communist Party or into a Communist group that would be a strong manpower group." Therefore, she said, that the party proposed to split this Nation into two nations, creating a nation of the Negroes separate from the whites. This Negro nation who, according to her words, were an oppressed group, would be very easy prey or very easy subjects to this manpower proposition that they had in mind. Now she spoke of this at two separate classes, and all of a sudden it disappeared. I don't know why, but I did read this in some other Communist literature previous to that time. Somehow or other all of a sudden a little fight over the thing and that was the last of it and we could not follow it up. In my position you could not ask too many questions; you observed and partook in different things. This Negro nation was a very serious move at one time in other clubs because I knew other people in other clubs.
Mr. SCHERER. The Negroes in the Communist Party, and properly so, immediately rose up against any idea of segregation. That was just one of the reasons they immediately abandoned it.
Mr. WEREn. We had no Negroes in our group.
Mr. SCHERER. That was the testimony, I believe, in San Francisco. was it not?
Mr. TAVENNER. We have had testimony in Washington, Milwaukee, and a number of places on this subject. The estimate that Elizabeth Glenn gave that the Negro people would be an easy prey was found out not to be at all prophetic or correct. A great deal of evidence has been introduced showing that they met no substantial measure of success with the persons of the Negro race.
Mr. SCHERER. The evidence is overwhelming that they resisted attempts to infiltrate groups almost better than any other group.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is correct. In many areas that has been the burden of the testimony. 
Mr. WEREB. May I add this, Mr. Doyle, that the Negroes that I know and have known over the period of years in the city of Los An- COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1793 geles were all fine, upstanding citizens. With the exception of very few, say nine during my whole time of membership in the party-and I don't think they stayed very long-I do not believe that I have known any Negro or person of the Negro race who was a willing prey or would accept such a policy at all. They were too busy trying to make their own way and trying to better themselves.
Mr. DOYLE. I think it appropriate, perhaps, for me to just refer to one paragraph at this point in view of the witness's testimony about revolutionary methods. I read a couple of paragraphs of this decision the other day. This is the decision of the United States of America v. Title (17,368), civil opinion by the Honorable Judge of the Federal Court in this very building on June 4,1955, Leon R. Yankwich, United States District Judge, in which a defendant admitted he had been a Communist and was a Communist, and he introduced the constitution of the Communist Party as part of his defense, by the way, to the court. The court in this case said, among other things: How anyone can find in themreferring to the literatuie of the Communist Party used by the American Communist Phrtyany advocacy of lawful means for effectuating the aims of communism or even lip service to democratic institutions is beyond our comprehension, for there is none. As appears more fully from other writings by Lenin which are in the record, in one he states that the proletarian state can only be achieved "through a violent revolution." This is repeated elsewhere. The Sixth World Congress of the Communist International's held in 1928 states emphatically that Leninism is the dominant approach on that-"the overthrow of capitalism is impossible without force, without armed uprising and proletarian wars against the bourgeosie." This interpretation is adopted by Stalin, who expresses it in this manner: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a revolutionary power based on the use of force against the bourgeosie " I read that into the record and I repeat that which I have often repeated In this hearing and elsewhere: I do not see how any patriotic American since 1944 or 1945 could possibly have been an active participant in Communist cell meetings such as you attended, sir, without knowing that the primary objective or intention, whenever it suited their convenience, was to build up a philosophy that the American working people were justified in using force against constitutional government. I repeat it now. I just have never understood how a patriotic American could do that if he ever learned of that objective. The court in this case says, and we know it, that the Communist literature advocated that and still does.
Mr. TAENNER. Mr. Wereb, what positions have you held in the Communist Party? as
Mr. WEREB. I held various positions, sir. I was for a short time,dipress I said, membership director and Peoples World director, the all to rector, literature director; I was a functionary delegate indusfunctionaries conventions. I was a delegate to the Southwest have to look. It trial section and-gosh, it has been so long I almost district also committee; executive the was plenty. I was a member of sir. manager for the Peoples World in the Southwest section,
Mr. DoLE. And all this time you were an FBI operator?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir. paid inMr. DOYLE. Then I suppose you would be classified as a former or stoolpigeon or something like that ? 1794 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WEREB. I have been called that.
Mr. DOYLE. I want to complment you for doing the job you did, whether you were paid or not.
Mr. WEREB. Might I add at this time, sir, that I never was paid a salary by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I had, or rather I would put out and put all bills ahead of time, made donations out of my own pocket to Communist drives, paper drives, the newspaper drives, defense drives, out of my own pocket. I was reimbursed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after I had given a statement to that effect.
Mr. DOYLE. Only your expenses?
Mr. WEREB. That is all, sir. I have never received 10 cents worth of salary at any time from anyone, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. We congratulate you more than ever if that is the case. I supposed you were paid a little something for it.
Mr. WELEB. Well, I think my freedom, sir. and the honor of calling myself an American citizen is pay enough.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Wereb, I asked you at- an earlier point in your testimony what security measures were taken by the Communist Party to make sure of you.
Mr. WEREB. At one time-I am trying to find the exact time-two people came to my home; one John Houston. I am trying to find the name of the other person. It was one evening, and I am very anxious to give you the name of that person. Just one second, sir. I have it among a lot of these notes here. Elsie Monjar. At one time she also ran for city council. The Communist label did not do so good.
Mr. DOYLE. What city?
Mr. WEREB. Los Angeles, sir. These two people came to my home and said, "Pete, what are you doing in the party?" That is not a very easy question to answer, especially when you know that you are under a sham, you are living a life other than what you really believe in. I made them explain just what they meant by it. I asked them a question on a question. I said, "John, do you have to be a bum to be a Communist?" That question kind of backed him down a little bit. They wanted to know all my progressive record, shall we say; again this bandied word of progressivism. I told them a story that happened to me when I was a young boy. It was of no consequence, but it was a sales idea and it went over. I invited them to examine my home, see if there were any police or Federal Bureau of Investigation documents about. I just told them how, gave them a real sad sob story. After them making me promise an allegiance to the Communist Party and to the Soviet Union, they left satisfied and I stayed on in my regular way. That was a 21 harrowing /2 hours.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was any question raised about your wife ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir. One of the questions that did not seem to have a satisfactory answer in their mind was why my wife was not a Communist. My wife is a very good church member, a very devout person. and it was a very hard thing to think one up, so I said she had a very serious nerve disorder, and therefore for the security of the party in my judgment she should not be a member. That was accepted. Now to give you a point of just how far they drove this security, a person by the name of Bronson Parrett and Fern Parrett, active Communists- COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1795 
Mr. TAVENNER. Spell it.
Mr. WEREB. P-a-r-r-o-t, I believe. I would have to check. Would it be all right if I check ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; I think you should make certain as to the spelling of the name.
Mr. WEREB. I will try the best I can, sir. He also was at one time chairman of our group. P-a-r-r-e-t-t, B-r-o-n-s-o-n. His wife was Fern Parrett. Now at one time he got into difficulty with the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. We understand that there may be a little different spelling to that name.
Mr. WEREB. There might be, sir, but that is as close as I can give at the present time. I still haven't found the name. Would you mind if I looked up the name and spelled it?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; and you can give it to us.
Mr. WEREB. All right, sir. I tried to get these names correctly. I have an awful lot of names here. P-a-r-r-e-t-t, Parrett. His wife, Fern Parrett. This man got into a difficulty of some type with the Communist leadership at the higher levels. He kept writing back to the New York office continually and that was objected to by the local group here-that is, the county group. Therefore, he was tried by the Communist security group and banned from the party. His wife stayed on. They approached his wife within a few days of the time they approached meMr. SCHERER. May I interrupt? Did you ever attend one of the trials or hearings where members were barred ?
Mr. WEREB. I believe I have, yes, sir, but at this time I would like to leave that for a little later because it would confuse this thought of mine.
Mr. SCHERER. Go ahead.
Mr. WEREB. They went to this woman and told her that unless she divorced her husband they would have to bounce her from the party or kick her out. The woman being a real Communist, as she called herself, did divorce her husband. That was not the only instance. There were many instances like it where they thought that the security of the party was affected by both man and wife not being members; and if both did not wish to be members, none of them could be members.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, if both did not want to become members of the conspiracy, break up the home ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. And the home is the most important unit we have in our Nation of people.
Mr. WEREB. That is right.
Mr. DOYLE. Break them up for the sake of the Communist Party. That is their philosophy, if need be, to further their conspiratorial aims, dastardly objectives.
Mr. WEREB. I believe at one time, to answer your question, Congressman, that I attended a meeting-I did not get into all of the meeting because someone called me out as to the progress of the Peoples World drive. At that time I believe it was one Alice Ward. She called me out. At that time they were trying one Lou-a man from Watts. I believe he also appeared in a number of Smith cases. I am trying to place his last name but it slips my mind a second. I did attend one of those farce trials, a cut and dried affair. He 1796 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA was an enemy of the workers-they classified him so. Secret literature was made up to the effect and it was dispatched to each club that no one should speak, contact him in any way, shape, manner, or form on any business because he had contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the police department or that he was an enemy of the working classes, and that was that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that individual's name Lou Rosser 
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir. I know the man by seeing him. I did not recall his name, but that is an outstanding event.
Mr. SCHERER. Lou Rosser was blacklisted from obtaining any employment in certain areas, was he not, or am I wrong?
Mr. TAVENNER. I do not believe I should comment on it.
Mr. SCHERER. I remember his testimony very well.
Mr. DOYLE. Was not Mr. Rosser a Negro ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. He was prevented from getting employment, he testified, because of his breaking with the party. They attempted to discredit him with even non-Communist employers. I remember the testimony very well.
Mr. TAVENNER. I failed to ask you a question I intended to ask you. When you were discussing these educational classes which you attended-I want to go back and pick it up-you told the committee about instruction that was received when Mr. Harry Hay came to your club as a teacher sent from the educational commission of the Communist Party. I am not sure whether you told us where that meeting was held. 
Mr. WEREB. That meeting was held on Yukon Street at the home of Dan and Eleanor McComb. That was their home. The whole series of classes held by this Harry Hay was conducted at that address.
Mr. TAVENNER. The question I failed to ask you is: Who were present at that meeting, if you can recall ?
Mr. WEREB. I would again have to refer to my notes, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well, sir.
Mr. WEREB. By the way, these are my own notes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When I ask who were present, I mean what persons as members of the Communist Party were present.
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir; I will be happy to give you that. There were John Houston, Vernon Potter, JackKarson, Edith Smith, Lou Stark, Mike Gorman, G-o-r-m-a-n. John Baldo, B-a-l-d-o; Ed Fitzgerald; Lillian Frong; Laura Lee Musick, M-u-s-i-c-k; Edwin Hagen, H-a-g-e-n; Dan McComb; Ellen Taylor, also known as Mary Rankin. At the present time I believe that is all I have as to that school.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are the spellings which you have given phonetic spellings? 
Mr. WTERE. Some may be, sir, but some are not. Some of the spellings I have which are correct would be the spellings that I have taken while I was membership-that is, the Peoples World district manager. Therefore, I would have to have some type of a spelling which was near correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. 9 Did you give a phonetic spelling for the name Laura Lee Musick COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1797 
Mr. WEREB. I believe that would be spelled M-u-s-i-c-k, but as I say, some of the spellings in my mind are phonetic, sir, and they are very, very hard to place at the present time as to the exact spelling. I will try my very best and honest best to give you the nearest I possibly can.
Mr. TAVENNER. We want to be as accurate about it as we can. The name Edwin Hagen, as to the spelling of that name, I am wondering whether it is a phonetic spelling you were giving or whether it was what you thought was the true spelling of the name.
Mr. WEREB. That was a true spelling as far as I knew because Mr. Hagen came to my home a number of times and I have read a number of letters that were addressed to him by that name. Therefore, I just copied that, and that is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us see if we can give some further identifying facts about that individual.
Mr. WEREB. Edwin Hagen was a refugee from Germany, a Communist-banned refugee. He was banned into Holland, and Holland I guess deported him as an undesirable. They deported him to Sweden. These are all according to his stories to me which were verified by his wife whom I met at one time and they laughed over it. Then Sweden deported him to Canada. He stayed a very short time in Canada and he was deported into Mexico and from Mexico he came to this country, and under what circumstances I never did find out, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know where he lived
Mr. WEREB. I have been to his home at that time. Of course, he no longer lives there. He lived in Inglewood. He was also a very, very close friend ofMr. TAVENNER. I would not speak of other persons unless those other persons were members of the Communist Party.
Mr. WEREB. They are members of the Communist Party. In other words, she was the head of the Communist Party at the time of Hagen's last disappearance and that was-she was one of the Smith cases with Schneiderman. That was Dorothy Healy. I met him a number of times at her home.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now you have told us that this group of the Communist Party to which you were assigned was the Hawthorne group.
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, who were the officers of that group from time to time as far as you can now recall?
Mr. WEREB. Would it be permissible to read that? I had that prepared because it is hard from memory to remember all the names.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that statement you have a statement which you made at the time of your reports to the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir. These are all bona fide accepted names as Communists whom I have known and met at closed Communist Party meetings and Communist functions and classes and functionary meetings. These people could not have attended any of these doings unless they were members in good standing in the Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. Right at that point, were these meetings conducted under such circumstances that those people would realize they were secret meetings? 1798 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I call your attention-my question was as to who were the officials at this point. Later I will want to come to that question.
Mr. DoYLE. I withdraw my question at present.
Mr. WEREB. Would it be permissible if I read these names to you
Mr. TAVENNER. I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that he be permitted to examine the list he prepared to refresh his recollection.
Mr. DOYLE. Yes, indeed. These were made in a prompt manner after the meeting?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. For the purpose of your day-to-day record to the FBI?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. This is a record of your own original memorandum you made ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Certainly it would be good in any court.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before you begin that, it may be well to consider taking the usual recess.
Mr. DOYLE. The committee will stand in recess 5 minutes. (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.) (Representatives Doyle, Scherer, and Moulder present after the recess.)
Mr. DOYLE. Let us proceed. Let the record show that 3 members of the subcommittee of 4 are present and therefore a legal quorum is here-Mr. Schrerr. of Ohio, Mr. Moulder, of Missouri, and Mr. Doyle, of Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you now proceed to tell the committee who were the officers of the Hawthorne Club of the Communist Party during the period that you were a member of it i
Mr. WEREB. I am trying to find that, sir. I had that here, and to the best of my recollection we have had John HoustonMr. TAVENNER. Just a moment.
Mr. WEREB. Do you want the officers?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; the officers first. Is John Houston the same person that you referred to earlier in your testimony i
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is the correct spelling of his last name H-o-u-s-t-o-n ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I think, Mr. Chairman, because of the similarity of names, although there is a difference in spelling, the record should plainly show that this is not John Huston, H-u-s-t-o-n.
Mr. DOYLE. That is correct, Mr. Counsel. The committee appreciates your being careful, just like you always are.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well, if you will proceed, please.
Mr. WEREn. William Kellas, also chairman: Dan McComb, chairman; Edith Smith, membership secretary and dues secretary. They are te same, only known under different names. Literature agent, Ola Pacitico, Eleanor Taylor.
Mr. TAVENNER. Spell the name, please.
Mr. WEREB. P-a-c-i-f-i-c-o, 0-1-a. Eleanor Taylor. Also financial director, Eleanor Taylor again. Marion Stark, educational director; Jack Karson, chairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. How does he spell the name?
Mr. WEREB. K-a-r-s-o-n. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1799 
Mr. MOULDER. In addition to the spelling of the name, can you give further identification ?
Mr. WEREB. The man at one timeMr. MOULDER. I mean as to any and all of those names. There may be a dozen people by the same name when you name one. Where he resided, his occupation.
Mr. WEREB. Occupation was helper, and he was also employed by the board of education at one time as a truckdriver and later became helper to his brother in the plumbing business.
Mr. MOULDER. His approximate age?
Mr. WEREB. He was approximately 40 years old at the time I knew him, and also he was a lieutenant in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish civil war, sir. He was a known Communist for many, many years.
Mr. MOULDER. Where did lie reside at that time ?
Mr. WEREB. He resided in Hawthorne, Calif. I am no longer familiar with the street addresses because there may be other people living at those addresses at the present time and it might be embarrassing to some of those people. That is why I do not like to give out street numbers, sir. These, to my recollection, were the officers at different times, various periods during my 4 years as a party member in Hawthorne and Inglewood.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have testified that you were a member of the executive committee at one time.
Mr. WVEREB. I was a member of the executive committee within 3 weeks of my party affiliation.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, who served on the executive committee of the Hawthorne group of the Communist Party with you? And in giving their names, as suggested by a menber of the committee, it would be well for you to give us much identifying information as you can recall so there will be no possible mistake of identity of the individuals.
Mr. WEREB. Ola Pacifico. She was with the health department of the county for a time and refused to take the loyalty oath and therefore she now is a private individual. Marion Stark, the wife of one Lou Stark, of Hawthorne. Calif. Dan McComb, worker in the airplane industry for a while, a barber, a student, and Lord knows what else. Edith Smith. a housewife and a bookkeeper for a short time with a concern which I do not recall at this time. Eleanor Taylor, a housewife of Inglewood. Mike Gorman. Mike Gorman was a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. He tried to repair clocks, radios. The last I heard, he never made the grade on any of those. He was originally from New York. Vernon L. Potter, a carpenter, for a time known as a contractor for himself, too. He also lived in Hawthorne. Louis Stark, the husband of Marion Stark, of the previously mentioned Hawthorne group. Ed HagenMr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. You may as well identify at this time, if you can, just what his activity was in the Communist Party, if you can tell us.
Mr. WEREB. Louis Stark was a liaison man of the Communist Party between the different political groups in our district, doing regional 1800 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA as well as municipal, county, or otherwise, and I believe, if I remember correctly, he was at one time a member of the Democratic central committee. His job was not to be known as a Communist but act as, shall we say-this is an unwelcome word-a liberal or a progressive representing those groups and acting as a liaison officer on anything that the party wanted to put over or any candidate the party wished to put over-any political program they might have had in mind which was also always on issues, never general political. They never accepted the Democrat or the Republican or the other principles in toto. They always picked on the issue and played the issue up because they thought that was the easiest key to the door they finally wanted to open.
Mr. MOULDER. May I interrupt? You say you believe he was a member of the Democratic central committee. Do you know positively of your own personal knowledge he was ?
Mr. WEREB. I believe I have read that, sir, but I never saw him there.
Mr. MOULDER.
Mr. WEREB. I
Mr. MOULDER.
Mr. WEREB. I You do not know, you just heard it ? read it. Read it where ? read it in the circulars that were put out by different election committees and different drive committees of different parties. I have seen his name on it, and he also reported to us in person at the party that he was a member of the Democratic central committee of that district.
Mr. MOULDER. What period was that?
Mr. WEREB. That was the period of 1945, 1946, 1947, sir; latter part of 1945. I am sorry, I do not mean to take any political party because I do not want-it is just an instance I wish to use there as he used to further himself and the party program. I do not wish to be disrespectful to any political party, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether at a subsequent date he be- came active in any other political group?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, he did. He became very active in the Independent Progressive Party, the IPP. I never was a member, so I would not know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you tell the committee of any action that was taken by the Communist Party at any of its meetings regarding the Independent Progressive Party?
Mr. WEREB. For a time the Communist Party tried to run candi- dates of their own. For instance, Archie Brown ran for governor of the State, and I do not believe anybody saw it outside of the party. I do not believe he got any more votes than the party. So the Communist Party decided that a third party was necessary, that it is imperative; they cannot run it as a Communist Party because it would not be acceptable to the average liberal group. Therefore, they decided that they would have another party. This party at the time was not identified. Later it became known by the literature that was brought to the club by this Lou Stark that the IPP was a constituted political party, and he was very active in this group. That is about all I can tell tell you on that, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. If you will proceed with your- 
Mr. WEREB. Pardon me. Just one more addition to that. It was with party approval and it was a party "must" that every member COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1801 go out and distribute all the literature, attend all IPP meetings; it was a "must." In other words, the hands were asked for at every club meeting which were closed Communist meetings, how many were going and how many were not. Somebody that did not raise their hands had to have a pretty good excuse, such as work or no one to leave the baby with or something of that sort in order not to participate in any of the IPP drives-mobilizations, call it whatever you like.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now will you proceed in your description of the membership of the executive committee of the Hawthorne Club?
Mr. WEREB. We had this Ed Hagen as a member of the executive committee. For a very short time we had a man named Earl Kelly from the Redondo group and a Mickey Johnson who was very active in the El Segundo group, which also was part of the HawthorneInglewood general group. Bert Coffee, C-o-f-f-e-e. He was known as an organizer of the oil workers; also came with credentials of the Communist Party to the executive meeting and became part of the executive committee at the time they had the strike at the Standard Oil Co. at El Segundo. He directed, with the assistance of the rest of the Communist group, the activities, the literature distribution, the picket line walking; and the progress of the strike was also directed by him.
Mr. TAVENNER. YOU testified at some length regarding his activity in the hearings at San Diego last year, I believe.
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Does that complete the list of the executive committee?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, of the executive committee, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you make a record of the membership of the Hawthorne Club of the Communist Party during the period of your work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
Mr. WEREB. I certainly did, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you advise the committee, please, as to that membership-but in doing so, let me ask you, to be certain that any name yo identify, that you do it on the basis of your own personal knowledge of their membership on the Communist Party.
Mr. WEREB. Do you want me to read the names now? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. And in making such identification, give us such descriptive information of the individual as you can so that should there be another person of a similar name or the same name, that description you would give would properly identify the person you are speaking of.
Mr. WEREB. I will try that, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. 
Mr. WEREB. Membership of the Hawthorne-Inglewood, El Segundo, Redondo Beach, and bay area groups, official membership that I have seen numbers for which I cannot give you at this time, I do not have those numbers, but these parties' membership cards I have seen with my own eyes and I have seen these people at different Communist meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Communist meetings, what type of Communist meetings?
Mr. WEREB. Closed meetings and closed meetings only. 
Mr. DOYLE. How do you know they were closed meetings? 1802 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WEREB. Being a member of the executive committee, I believe I had something to do with it that we had nothing but Communists in that meeting or if it was a functionaries meeting, sir, it was up to the credentials committees and those governing the attendance to see to it that everyone had proper credentials before entering any of these meetings. There were no haphazard accounts of any of these names.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right, sir.
Mr. WEREB. Ol.f Johnson, an elderly man employed by the Navy Department at Seattle. a warehouseman, lived near me in Inglewood. Lillian Frong, F-r-o-n-g, a housewife, in the Westchester area, I believe. Lawrence Pacifico, ex-soldier-that I know-and went to school out at the college, El Camino College, as a student under the GI bill. Nathan Strout, an elderly man, a violin teacher. S-t-r-o-u-t. Gene Chriss, a member of the New York group of the Communist Party, of the San Joaquin Valley group and finally the Los AngelesHawthorne and El Segundo group.
Mr. TAVENNER. You gave the spelling of the last name earlier, but will you give it agam ?
Mr. WEREB. C-h-r-i-s-s, G-e-n-e. Gene Chriss was also a P. W. director and district manager after the district was split up into a number of groups.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by P. W. director?
Mr. WEREB. Peoples World director. Sally Chriss, housewife, his wife. who lived on Aviation Boulevard as his wife. Dave Chriss: The father of Gene Chriss, elderly man. Barney Frong: An aviation worker. Pauline Sullivan: Redondo Beach, a housewife, Dave Belt, B-e-l-t: A contract cesspool digger. Ida Karson, K-a-r-s-o-n: The wife of Jack Karson, the man I spoke of as being a lieutenant in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Adrienne Fein, F-e-i-n: A housewife, very active in another organization known as the IWO.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is the first name Adrienne, or is that Mrs. Adrian?
Mr. WEREB. That is Mrs. Adrienne. I want to apologize for omitting this. In the party we never call anybody Mr. or Mrs. and it is natural for me to omit them. Iam sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. The point I want to get clear is whether the first name Adrian is the name of the husband or is it the wife's first name
Mr. WEREB. That is the wife's first name. Jack Good: Occupation unknown. I. M. Tomren, T-o-m-r-e-n: This man was a retired old man, kind of helpless, but a member. Ruth Schorr, S-c-h-o-r-r, lived in another district. She was very active in a labor group somewhere. Pat Ruso: A mystery character. He would go and disappear and come back and the club or group or county never seemed to ask why. He was about 38 years old, and the only way I could identify him, he was of Italian origin, I believe, and that is all. Morrey Korngold. M-o-r-r-e-y K-o-r-n-g-o-l-d, a printer or printer's helper, of the Westchester area. His wife Rochelle Korngold, R-o-c-h-e-l-l-e. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1803 Jules Tanzman, T-a-n-z-m-a-n: A merchant in surplus merchandise.
Mr. MOULDER. Where? 
Mr. WEREB. His residence was Inglewood or Westchester, and his business was located on Santa Fe Street in the 2600 block. He specialized in surplus aluminum. Rudy Love: He was an indigent loafer here and there, and that is ill. He had no occupation or no connection whatsoever. David B. Glass: The partner of Jules Tanzman in the same surplus business. Ellen McComb: Wife of Dan McComb, housewife. Jerry Kramer, K-r-a-m-e-r: Aircraft worker, Westchester District. Elsie Mancar, M-a-n-c-a-r: Full-time employee of the United Mine, Mill and Smelter Union as a secretary. Also, executive secretary to the southwest section of the industrial section of the Los Angeles County Communist Party. Don Healy, former husband of Dorothy Healy. Fern Parrett: The lady referred to as the person who had to divorce her husband because of non-Communist membership after the discharge of the man. Laura Lee MusickMr. SCHERER. Pardon me. Do you know whether in that divorce case that was mentioned as a ground for divorce ?
Mr. WEREB. Not in the United States courts, I do not believe, but in the Communist trial it was. You see, she was tried by a special committee giving her the choice of either staying in the party, sir, or divorcing her husband. That still is a trial and a security trial known by the Communists as such.
Mr. SCHERER. I was referring to the divorce court.
Mr. WEREB. I do not believe our local courts would accept that.
Mr. DOYLE. You mean the Communist cell of which you were or one of the committeesDid you ever hear any Communist Party member in a Communist Party trial or meeting claim that he did not have to testify because it might incriminate him ?
Mr. WEREB. No, sir; there is no such a thing in the Communist Party, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. NO such thing as decliningMr. WEREB. That is a dictatorship in toto.
Mr. DOYLE. There is no such thing as having the constitutional privilege in the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. There is no constitutional privilege.
Mr. DOYLE. They are American citizens most of them.
Mr. MOULDER. Every one understands that. You say you were not there and you do not personally have any knowledge of this occurrence other than by hearsay?
Mr. WEREB. I have a person also at that trial by the name of Mickey Johnson who came to me and said she was a member of that investigative or whatever trial body, and she told me so.
Mr. MOULDER. I am not trying to discredit you or question whether or not that occurred, but it is just bringing up the proposition that you did not know it yourself.
Mr. DOYLE. My question was directed because I wanted to know the method they used in Communist Party trials. 1804 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. MOULDER. He says he was not there. I do not know how he would know.
Mr. WEREB. I sat through 2 hours of one of those trial ordeals by John Houston and Elsie Mancar, and I need not be anywhere else to know what goes on. With me it was just like anybody else, no different. When it came to party security and party progress, no one stood in the way, whether it was Browder or whoever. It did not make any difference. It was the party or else.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. WEREB. Where did I stop on the last name ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Don Healy, I believe, was the last name.
Mr. WEEEB. He was the ex-husband of one Dorothy Healy, a Smith Act case. Fern Parrett is the woman I just referred to. Laura Lee Musick: A housewife, M-u-s-i-c-k. Barney Frong: I believe he was an aircraft worker. Marion Hart: I saw her card, but I do not recall what her occupation was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether she has another name?
Mr. WEREB. I believe most of those people had another name, but I do not recall just at the present moment.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. 
Mr. WEREB. Alice Elconin, wife of a union organizer of some type. I do not know, but I think he was connected with the Electrical Workers Union or something. Alice Elconin-she was recruited by Ruth Schorr, and this took place at the home of Morrey and Rochelle Korngold in the early part of 1947. That is the only way I can identify the lady.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the spelling of the last name?
Mr. WEREB. E-l-c-o-n-i-n. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Would that membership have been during the period of World War II?
Mr. WEREB. I believe World War II was over in 1947.
Mr. TAVENNER. I did not understand; I thought you said it began earlier.
Mr. WEREB. Early part of 1947 at the home of Morrey Korngold and Rochelle Korngold.
Mr. TAVENNER. I misunderstood the date. 
Mr. WEREB. Processed and brought to the meeting by one Ruth Schorr. Byron Taylor, a merchant marine. Floyd Wallace: I believe he was an auto mechanic, husband of Shevey Wallace, a fulltime Los Angeles County Communist Party employee. S-h-e-v-e-y-I believe that is the spelling. Sybil Ward, an aircraft worker. Charles C. Watkins, retired mailman. He delivered mail in that district.
Mrs. Mel Wilkerson, housewife. Blanche Zamudio, a member in the east side; Z-a-m-u-d-i-o. Ed Bodner: I do not recall too much of the man at the present time or his occupation. I may later on.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the spelling of the last name ? 
Mr. WEREB. I believe it is B-o-d-n-e-r. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1805 Steve Adams, for a while an aircraft worker, later engaged in business for himself in machinist work. Rose Mary Bennick, B-e-n-n-i-c-k, housewife. John Biluk, B-i-l-u-k. I think he is an aircraft worker. Cary Cain, president. I do not know what his trade or what he was. Alice Cantu, C-a-n-t-u, housewife. Wayne Cantu. Mel Christiansen: I do not recall what his connection was, but he was in the district in the Hawthorne-Inglewood group. Leo Clark, insurance salesman. Araby Colton, C-o-l-t-o-n, A-r-a-b-y; housewife. For a while employed at one of the aircraft companies. Victor Colton, her husband; shipyard worker. Edith Dexter, housewife; Inglewood district. Mansell Dexter: He was a mechanic of some type. Louis Emery, E-m-e-r-y.
Mr. TAVENNER. Which spelling of Louis is used ?
Mr. WEREB. L-o-u-i-s. Herb Evans, industrial worker in the Hawthorne group. Ruth Evans, housewife. That is his wife. Pen Vandervoort, P-e-n, V-a-n-d-e-r-v-o--r-t, private secretary. Susan Vandervoort, wife; same spelling. Housewife. I believe I have here a little addition of a few more names. Sam Fujimoto, F-u-j-i-m-o-t-o. I think lie was a truck gardener. Florence Goldman, Inglewood district; transferee from the Young Communist League. George Hawks, a shipyard worker; H-a-w-k-s. Wenzel Lehr, W-e-n-z-e-l, L-e-h-r, industrial worker. I believe he was in the Hawthorne district there. Gerda Leiva, G-e-r-d-a, L-e-i-v-a, an elderly lady living alone in, I believe, Redondo or the next town further, I guess, Manhattan district. Carl Pekstan, C-a-r-1, P-e-k-s-t-a-n; occupation unknown. Frank Phieffer P-h-i-e-f-f-e-r. I do not know his occupation, but he was of the Inglewood district. Earl Pinkston, Westchester district; P-i-n-k-s-t-o-n. Ruth Smith, housewife; fulltime Communist.
Mr. MOULDER. May I intervene here? As an illustration of what I had in mind a while ago, I venture to say probably in the great metropolitan area of Los Angeles there are very likely 15 or 20 people by the name of Ruth Smith, a housewife. The naming and publica-is tion of that name will be a reflection upon each of them unless there some definiteMr. WEREB. Hawthorne district. I referred to Edith Smith, Ruth comSmith-same family, same group, same occupation as far as nurse. munism was concerned. I believe at one time she was an Army Edith of I believe that; I do not know that to be a fact. Daughter Smith. I met her and I knew her to be-I went to Edith Smith's home on the average of twice a week for the period of 3 or 4 years, and I believe I would know her.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you locate the home? itMr. WEREB. I think the number was, if you must have Without giving the number, give the general location. 
Mr. DOYLE. Somebody else may live there now. 65500-55--t. 4--3 1806 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WEREB. It was in Imperial and Hawthorne Boulevard district, in the immediate vicinity of. Peggy Vaughn a schoolteacher, V-a-u-g-h-n. Tony Talon, T-a-l-o-n, industrial aircraft worker of some type. This was the membership of the Hawthorne Communist group, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You referred to a person by the name of Vaughn. What was her first name?
Mr. WEREB. Peggy. That was her party name, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was her party name ? 
Mr. WEREB. That was the name that I knew her by. At the time I knew her, the party did not exactly ban the correct names unless it was for some activity that the party did not want you to be known in.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us further identifying information relating to her ?
Mr. WEREB. She was a schoolteacher in the Los Angeles Board of Education District. She was a person about 5 foot, if I recall right. She had light chestnut hair; weighed, I would say, a hundred five pounds. She was very active in Communist circles as to education. She was very much displeased with the changeover of the Communist Party of America, to the phony we had there at one time known as the Communist Political Association. When that change came she transfered from our group to what is known-they cut the groups up into language groups; they cut them into industrial groups; they cut them into shop groups; they cut them into teachers, artists, different union groups. Then I lost track of her after that, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is adequate.
Mr. WEREB. That was the total membership, to the best of my knowledge, of the Hawthorne-Inglewood and bay area Communist groups. These are taken from my own notes that I have saved over a period of time that I was with the Federal Bureau of Investigation as their undercover man.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DOYLE. Yes, Mr. Moulder.
Mr. MOULDER. The spirit in which I question you is not at all in the spirit of doubting your testimony or anything that you have said as to be the exact truth as you have testified to it, but the purpose of it is this: The question which I wish to ask you is this: You have named approximately how many people?
Mr. WEREB. Approximately a hundred in that group, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. A hundred people as having been affiliated and actively affiliated with the Communist Party and its activities over a certain period of time. Each of those parties named will be published in the newspapers, are going to be, revealed in that light with great injury to themselves wherever they may reside, doing great damage to them and their reputation, just as severely as if they had been tried in a court of law and convicted. To a degree, that is the result. Now, you have stated that each one of those that you have named was in attendance at closed party meetings. Can you state the time and place as to each one of those persons and the occasion that you recall when they did so attend and to what degree they did participate in Communist Party functions and affairs?
Mr. WEREB. I believe, sir, that I have separated those who were in the executive meetings. Executive meetings were held every week of the year, sir. Then membership meetings were held every other week. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1807 Some groups met once a month. It would be humanly impossible to take each and every one of these people, sir, and put them into any special one meeting unless there was any special activity whereby their names stood out in my mind or stood out as to they have acted in a violent manner, taught or advocated personally those instances-yes, I probably could give you time and dates on those. But these other general memberships, sir, it would be humanly impossible to place these people at different meetings.
Mr. MOULDER. Were the meetings held at different places?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. At those meetings, did you record the names of thcse present from which you now present the names before this committ,-e
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. You took notes during the meetings or immediately after the meetings?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. Which way ?
Mr. WEREB. Sometimes mental, sometimes match covers, sometimes back of Peoples World. I can say that I have a fairly good memory, sir, and when the meeting was over and when I delivered my chargesI had to pick up a number of indigents who had no transportation, delivered them home-I searched my mind just like I was on trial, who was there. That one thing, I did not know who else was checking up on me, too. Therefore, I could not possibly make a mistake because someone would call me on it in a hurry or say, Who was such and such person? I do not believe during the 4 years or over I have acted in that capacity that I have made an error because there were a number of others who would check on others, too. I was not the only one. Therefore, say the police department had their intelligence men there and they do compare notes, you know; I didn't, but they do. Therefore, it was very important to me that I would minimize rather than exaggerate.
Mr. MOULDER. I am sure of that. Now you say each of those persons named attended regularly at closed Communist Party meetings.
Mr. WEREB. Over the period of 4 years; yes, sir. There was no one person outside of probably myself that attended every meeting. The only meeting I missed during that period, sir, was a time I had very serious surgery and I had to miss it because I could not possibly go that way. But outside of that, I made sure there was no such thing. I never went to bed any morning until a full report was written out while fresh in my mind from the notes and no chance for error and no chance for dreaming overnight that did not happen. Sometimes I did not get to bed before 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning, and that is what broke my health, I put in so much time. I would go to the embassy, 150 names of people present, or at the Shrine auditorium or any doings at-2200 which is a favorite haunt.
Mr. MOULDER. The testimony now before the committee has just covered the Hawthorne area?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, just the Hawthorne area. I got more.
Mr. TAVENNER. You submitted the reports that you prepared of each meeting to the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir. 1808 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand you to say that other people were doing the same thing.
Mr. WEREB. Possibly. I did not know any, but possibly there were because I do not really believe the Federal Bureau of Investigation would rely on just one person, or the sheriff's office or the police department. They probably did not even know I existed. But these were all persons whose names I have given you, sir, who were at closed Communist functions and meetings where no one else can appear but Communists in good standing as far as the Communist Party is concerned.
Mr. MOULDER. I think you have made a very careful and accurate record.
Mr. WEREB. I was very careful about it because I was very conscious of the fact that people did not get smeared, and it is something-words you can say, you can never take back. It is just like water; if you spill water, you can never pick it up.
Mr. MOULDER. I believe you have performed your duty very carefully.
Mr. WEREB. Thank you, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask one question of this witness before we adjourn for luncheon?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. You have testified, both in your original statement and then in answers to my question and others, that definitely there was revolutionary propaganda and program spoken of by these instructors at these classes who came to your group from the county educational level. Then I questioned you as to whether or not that included statements by these instructors from the county level of the Communist Party that there would be force necessary eventually to overthrow the capitalistic system. Now, up until the time you left the party, did you ever hear any instructor from the county level or any other level in the Communist Party tell your cell when you were present that they had changed their revolutionary line? In other words, did they stop teaching that function?
Mr. WEREB. To a peaceful line?
Mr. DOLE. Yes.
Mr. WEREB. No, sir. The works of Lenin, if anyone has read, and 1 was compelled to read some of it, sir, the works of Lenin will tell you the method of revolution, sir; the method of violence.
Mr. DOLE. I know that, sir.
Mr. WEREB. They cannot practice anything, but Marxism teaches you what, Leninism tells you how to-how to force it.
Mr. DOYLE. You attended meetings almost every week or so. Anyone attending the meetings which you attended of the Communist Party, the closed meetings in the Hawthorne-Inglewood area, more or less during the period which you attended-what is your answer to the question whether or not it would have been possible, or probable put it that way-would have been probable that any adult attending those meetings in that cell such as you attended over that period of 3 or 4 years could possibly have attended more or less regularly without hearing instruction that sooner or later there would be force and violence needed ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1809 
Mr. WEREB. It would be impossible for this reason, sir, not to hear, because when you joined the Communist Party, sir, you were sent to a Marxist class of some type, whether club level or downtown level, and therefore they would teach you this tenet. In other words, this creed they teach it to you; and if you attend Communist Party meetings more than 3 or 4 times, unless you are a-pardon the expressionnitwit, you could not help but know it was a revolutionary group that had as its purpose the overthrow of the United States Government by force and violence.
Mr. DOYLE. Of course, some of those in attendance might have just figured that was a sort of theoretical philosophy rather than anything they intended to put into practice, could they not?
Mr. WEREB. To prove practice in that respect, Mr. Doyle, you have to take this into consideration. It was not only the teaching but the actual practice of mobilization in the Communist Party which demonstrated its worth, its power, and its position. Even if you went out on a newspaper drive, they would say it was a mobilization, to mobilize forces to bring about-that is No. 1. If you went out to distribute leaflets, there was a leaflet distribution mobilization. Everything pertaining to anything that they know of-if I were to go out and distribute literature of any kind, I would say it is a literature distribution in favor of or against. When you are constantly reminded that this is a party activity, this is a must, this is a mobilization, you could not very well be stupid enough, no one could be stupid enough, to not know what they were doing.
Mr. DOYLE. That explains to me again one reason why so many people plead the fifth amendment, because they heard that sort of philosophy talked and they did it with their eyes open. Now and then Find one that was asleep with his eyes open, but generally not. I asked you that question because I surmise there will be other witnesses from that area today or tomorrow who may plead the fifth amendment, and I just want to understand some of the reasons why they might. Your testimony today makes me understand why they do, because it might incriminate them.
Mr. WEREB. I have omitted here about 10 very important names from this group. I wonder if it would be all right to call them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Which group ?
Mr. WEREB. Ten very important names from this group I have omitted which I would like to identify at this time, if you can give me 5 minutes.
Mr. DOYL. Are these people personally known to you to be members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, very important people.
Mr. DOYLE. To your personal knowledge ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir; those who contributed to the Communist effort.
Mr. DOYLE. I think we ought to hear the witness on these positive identifications. We are not going to shield any of them.
Mr. WEREB. Eleanor Potter, the wife of the Vernon L. Potter; Bronson Parrett, this man who was tossed from the Communist Party for certain reasons: Charles Karson, brother of Morris Karson, brother of Jack Karson. 1810 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA The Karson family are in the plumbing business in the southwest side somewhere or in the Adams district. I would not know, but that is the last I knew where they were active; Gladys Houston, the wife of one John Houston, H-o-u-s-t-o-n, a housewife. Contributed her efforts as to mailing, typing-whatever work, literary work, was necessary.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she the wife of the same John Houston you identified as chairman of the group ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right. Henry Garrish, a self-styled aviation mechanic; Georgiana Garrish, the mother of Henry Garrish; John Garrish, same family at the Paseo de Gracia address; Laura R. Garrish; Onya Fisher, O-n-y-a F-i-s-h-e-r; Ed Fisher. I believe the Fishers were aircraft workers of some type. I do not know their exactthey are from the Hawthorne district. These are the last few names I omitted from our group which was a little over a hundred there at one time.
Mr. DOYLE. You have given us these names as contributors to the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. Any time you contribute effort, time, or moneys and carry a Communist card, sir, you are a Communist.
Mr. DOYLE. Did they carry cards
Mr. WEREB. Yes, most of them. 
Mr. DOYLE. Are any people of that group that you knew not members of the Communist Party?
Mr. WEREB. They were members of the Communist Party of that group at one time or another during that 4-year period.
Mr. DOYLE. The 4-year period beginning when and ending when?
Mr. WEREB. I would say January 1944 to the first of January 1948.
Mr. DOYLE. They were members, all of them, from time to time of the same group you were a member of ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, same group; either transferred in or transferred out.
Mr. DOYLE. You sat in closed meetings with them ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir; I was one of the executive committee members, and therefore I had to be there.
Mr. DOYLE. We will adjourn until 2 o'clock. (Whereupon, at 12:20 p. m., a recess was taken until 2 p. m., of the same day.) AFTERNOON SESSION-JULY 1, 1955 (At the reconvening of the hearing after the noon recess, Repre- sentatives Doyle, Moulder, and Scherer were present.)
Mr. DOYLE. The committee will please reconvene. Let the record show that Congressman Scherer, of Ohio; Congressman Moulder, of
Missouri; and Congressman Doyle, of California, are present. This morning at 12:20, Mr. Counsel, we recessed until 2 o'clock, and it is now just exactly 2 o'clock. Again this afternoon I know we will have the very fine cooperation of everyone in the room, neither making any demonstration for anything that harms or against any,thing that happens by way of approbation. Thank you very much. COMMUIUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1811 TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN A. WEREB-Resumed
Mr. WEEB. Yes, I did, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like for you to tell the committee, please, what you observed.
Mr. WEREB. A man by the name of Stanley Chemiel who was known as a Communist came to an executive committee meeting. This will have to be phonetic, or as close as possible. Stanley was his first name, C-h-e-m-i-e-l. That is as close as I could get to that name. He was a real-estate broker, and I do not know what else around the city. He came and he said that the party was very much interested in the veterans and gaining enough veterans with military experience, and they were thinking of establishing a group similar to the American Legion or the AMVETS or the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and that they would give this a new name. Again they dragged out the liberal, progressive name and said the other veterans' organizations were reactionary and Fascist-minded and therefore they would try to institute a new organization. In the South Bay area at that time a party by the name of Jack Kramer, K-r-a-m-e-r-this is the same Kramer I previously mentioned as a member of the Hawthorne Communist group-Mike Gorman and Pete Johnson--Johnson-by the way this was at his home, and Johnson was a Communist of long record. At one time at my home he said that during the riot somewhere in Joliet or somewhere he hoisted the Red flag above the city hall and tore down the American flag. These were the type of people that held the meeting and were going to start this new organization. At that time they named it the American Veterans Committee. I am a veteran and do not know anything about it, never belonged to them. They had quite a meeting. A committee was appointed to represent the group, and in that committee was a Mike Gorman and P. Johnson representing the Hawthorne group. Being Peoples World director at that time and district manager, I was left out of the further proceedings. But the next general meeting that I know of the veteransMr. TAVENNER. Before you come to the next general meeting, you said that the principal instigator was a person named Stanley Chemiel.
Mr. WEREB. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether he used any other name?
Mr. WEREB. I do not believe I do, sir. This is the only name I ever knew the man by. He was one that represented the group. The next meeting was held in the Venus area, and after that there was, I believe on Vermont Avenue somewhere, a very large meeting held. Only through newspapers and through the Peoples World did I follow the progress of this American Veterans Committee. The Peoples World, of course being very friendly to it, immediately pointed out to me that, well, things could be different and they should be different as far as veterans' organizations are concerned. 1812 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CAIF., AREA At subsequent meetings of the group and the functionaries, the American Veterans Committee always received firsthand attention because they did put up a veterans' commission in the functionaries of the Los Angeles County Communist organization. So in the future when I mention Los Angeles County, I do not mean the State or the county organization of our instituted Government, but I mean the Communist Party. Further from that, of course, I could not be inter- ested because I had too many other duties to do. Someone else probably took up where I left off, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You gave us a list of the positions which you held in the Communist Party. I do not believe that any of those positions were on a county or State level, were they ?
Mr. WEREB. Any functionary attending any of the county functions, meetings, is considered as a working part of the Communist functionary group. You are not one of the county committee board members, but you do function as an active functionary in your district.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever function in that capacity ?
Mr. WEREB. I did, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe that to the committee?
Mr. WEREB. One of the functions I would like to call your attention to was in the month of June, I believe, 1945. I was given credentials by the club chairman, John Houston. This was printed by the Los Angeles County Communist Board, and it was signed. With these credentials I attended what was known as the southwest section, southern section of the State of California Convention of the Communist Party. That was held in the Danish Hall around 24th or 25th Street, a few doors east of Vermont Avenue. This was approximately the month of June in 1945.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the purpose of that meeting? 
Mr. WEREB. Prior to the meeting there was a copy of a letter or a printed form of a letter that was submitted to each group known as the Duclos letter. This Duclos letter was a speech that was written by a French Communist by the name of Duclos in France criticizing the Browder regime at that time for its semicooperation with capitalism and capitalist governments. An educational, which is held 1 hour of each meeting of the regular membership of each group, was held prior to this and the oldtimersthe old revolutionaries-were very elated that the letter appeared. They thought they would send their best representatives of the group to this doing. I attended that, entered the auditorium on the second floor with this pass.
Mr. TAVENNER. With this what? 
Mr. WEREB. With this credential pass. There were about 350 to 400 people present at this, and they were all functionaries. There could be no one that would enter that group without a pass, an official pass.
Mr. TAVENNER. What means were adopted to be certain that those present had proper credentials 
Mr. WEREB. There were these passes, and if you did not have a credential card you were sent to a committee room to be identified. I happened to be fortunate enough to be elected to the credentials committee with Emily Gordon and Max Silver-the three of us were on the credentials committee-and there we had to identify or someone COMM 1UNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1813 had to identify a person who had no Communist credentials but who was a known and active Communist. There, sir, I met a man who was brought into that room whom I identified as Ring Lardner, Jr. He came into that room and Max Silver identified the man and vouched for him. Therefore, we seated him with the Hollywood delegation. This meeting went on for a day, full day, and a night. There were new chairmen elected to this group and, as I said before, they were all active functionaries of the Communist Party. Different people approached microphones located at strategic positions on the convention floor. I believe there were 5, 1 for the speaker and 2 in each aisle. As these members would come up, they would come up with a prepared text praising the Duclos letter and damning Browder but darn good. The very first speaker that I recall was William Schneiderman, a Smith Act case. He stood there before theee 400 delegates and said he was very sorry that he had cooperated with the Browder revisionism and that if the party would elect him or appoint him as the head of the State Communist group, he would try to be more militant and lead the party to a more militant role. Next came, I believe, Dorothy Healy. She was always revolutionary. She just went on down the line staying with the rest. Paul Cline, who at one time was assistant editor of the Peoples World, approached the microphone and he also confessed to his revisionist attitude and prepared to be and promised to be more revolutionary. Max Silver made a very feeble effort, but he was the head of the Los Angeles County Communist Party during the Browder administration, so he was doomed and he knew it. Next came a person by the nameMr. TAVENNER. I would like to refresh the recollection of the committee on the point of Max Silver.
Mr. DOYLE. He has testified and cooperated with this committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. He testified before the committee that when he saw this letter for the first time, which I believe was at breakfast, he stated to his wife that that letter was the equivalent of a declaration of war and that the only thing that was uncertain was the time at which the war would occur. He laid his plans then, as soon as he saw that letter, to get out of the Communist Party, which he did.
Mr. MOULDER. Declaration of war by what country ?
Mr. TAVENNER. By the Soviet Union. 
Mr. WEREB. It is very true that Mr. Silver made a very feeble effort to defend himself. The next speaker was a person by the name of Buth Goldstein, G-o-l-d-s-t-e-i-n, I believe. This man stood in the center of the auditorium-I beg your pardon; the right side of the auditorium-and stated he was a Communist for 11 years; that he was a sergeant in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade; that he served under the command of one Jack Karson, previously mentioned as a member of the Hawthorne group, who was a lieutenant in this group. He could not understand why the Communist Party of the United States ever sunk to the level of cooperation, revisionism, and he demanded that there would be a revolution of the workers of this country; that there would be estab- lished a dictatorship of the proletariat. he got quite an ovation. With that, when he finished, 1814 COMMUNITYT ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA The next speaker was a man by the name of Ray Durant, also identified himself. As to his Communist membership and leadership, beat his breast like the rest of them, I guess, about how sorry they were about revisionism. He promised a very much more militant role. He demanded that in the resolution of the day, which was to be drawn up by the resolutions committee of that group, that it be embodied, his demand, that there would be an overthrow of the United States Government and the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat. With that, the whole group gave him a terrific, terrific sendoff. He really got quite an applause. That is one of the functions that I have attended.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee has heard evidence a number of times about the purpose of the Duclos letter and the result of the Duclos letter, but I believe this is the first time we have had an eyewitness account of a meeting in a locality describing the participation that people took in the deliberations. May I ask you whether or not, at the time or very shortly after the time that you observed this meeting that you made a report of it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation?
Mr. WEREB. I made a report that evening and the following day; that is, the following evening, after the meeting was over, because I had too many names and it seemed like everyone was taking notes. I took notes and I managed to identify a lot of people as they stood and identified themselves to speak and as to their union affiliation, their positions in the union. I could not help but feel that that was an important step toward protection of the proper union people, people with good, respectable standings in their unions. It alarmed me to this extent: that I believe labor was slandered, having people like that at any command or leadership post, but that was the party's program and policy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you record the names of the persons present that you could identify?
Mr. WEREB. I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. As members of the Communist Party?
Mr. WERE. I did, sir. Did you wish to hear them now? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me ask you this first: Do they include in some instances the names of the members of the Hawthorne Club that you have already given us?
Mr. WEREB. I believe there are about four names in there in that group. There were, I believe, four delegates to this convention.
Mr. TAVENNER. With the exception of a very small number, these are persons not already identified by you
Mr. WEREB. That is correct, and these are all functionaries of the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. I would like for to proceed. Again, if you can give any identifying information in addition to the name itself, I wish you would do it.
Mr. WEREB. I will try. The first person was William Schneiderman, Smith case.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say 'Smith case," you are speaking of one of the defendants in the Smith trial?
Mr. WEREB. Yes; who was convicted of the Smith Act. Alice Ward Sparks: The assistant manager, business manager, of the People's World in Los Angeles. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1815 Bud Blair, B-l-a-i-r: This man was the chairman of the South Side or industrial section. Emil Freed, F-r-e-e-d, who was convicted in the Los Angeles courts for inciting a riot at some strike line or other, and he served a little time. Harold Roberts: An employee of the Peoples World.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I interrupt you a moment. Do you know whether Emil Freed was at one time a candidate for the United States Senate on the Communist ticket ?
Mr. WEREB. I do not recall. Helen Norfjor, N-o-r-f-j-o-r: A printer's helper. John Stapp, active in the moving picture umons. I do not know which one, in the moving picture industry.
Mr. TAVENNER. These, I understand, were functionaries.
Mr. WEREB. Yes, sir; functionaries. These were all people who were delegated with these credentials and these credential cards, because as the cards were turned in I copied the names.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee has had considerable evidence regarding John Stapp and his activities as a functionary.
Mr. WEREB. Beebe Goldstein, an employee of a trucking concern. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Spell Goldstein.
Mr. WEREB. G-o-l-d-s-t-e-i-n.
Mr. TAVENNER. And spell all of the names after this.
Mr. WEREB. I am sorry. Miriam Brooks, M-i-r-i-a-m B-r-o-o-k-s. So far as I knew, that was correct. We have a repetition here; Dan McComb.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whom you have already identified.
Mr. WEREB. I have already identified him in the Hawthorne group. Edith Smith: I have already identified her in the Hawthorne group. Dave Chriss, who at that time was heading the El Segundo-Redondo group. They had split. Jean Chriss: I have already identified her as the relative of Dave Chriss. Wilhelmina Maise, M-a-i-s-e: She is the one that signed me up to the Communist Party and was chairman of the West Lake group. Elizabeth Glenn-also knew her as Elizabeth Leich Glenn. Adele Young, a housewife, I believe, and active around the bookstore quite a bit, Progressive Book Shop. Lou Baron, active in a builder's union; also I believe for awhile on the county committee, B-a-r-o-n. Mike German; also identified this person before. Chester Fein, F-e-i-n: I also identified him in the Hawthorne group. Bea or Beatrice Baron, B-a-r-o-n, a fulltime employee of the Los Angeles County Communist Party collecting dues from dues secretaries. Bill O'Neil: I believe he was an aircraft worker, O'-N-e-i-l, of a group on the west side somewhere. Frank Whitley, W-h-i-t-l-e-y: Whitley was the chairman, I believe, of the Adams Communist Party group. Ann Trojan, T-r-o-j-a-n, very active in the Rhetta group.
Mr. TAVENNER. What group
Mr. WEREB. Rhetta Club of the Communist Party; R-h-e-t-t-a, I believe. The Rhetta group. 1816 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA Louise McCord, M-c-C-o-r-d: I believe she was one of the delegates in a number of functions from a different group, but I cannot recall which one. Nemmy Sparks: This man was the chairman of the Los Angeles County Communist Party at 124 West Sixth Street for a period of a year and a half or more. N-e-m-m-y. This was an alias, and I never did find out what his real name was. Dorothy Healy, H-e-a-l-y: She succeeded Max Silver in his position as the party executive secretary.
Mr. DOYLE. When was Max Silver deposed or when did he get out? What happened?
Mr. WEREB. Right after the Duclos letter he was disposed of.
Mr. DOYLE. Just like Browder ? 
Mr. WEREB. Yes, evicted; could not serve the purpose of the revolutionary group. Was of no use to the party.
Mr. DOYLE. I read the Duclos letter some years ago, and as I recall the appraisal I made of it, it was the same as you have. The Communist papers disagreed with Browder's belief that the Communist policy would fit in and keep economic peace with the capitalistic philosophy of our Nation, and the Soviet Communist Party through Duclis, the Frenchman as you say, wrote this letter to this country showing it could not be; that there must be the survival of one economic philosophy or he other, Soviet communism or our own capitalist people. Some people favor the Soviet Communist philosophy.
Mr. WEREB. At one time I was appointed temporary educational director. A full-time Communist employee of the party by the name of George Sandy instructed me as to how to conduct an educational, which is most important of any Communist meeting. He said, "Well, you know during this Browder period"-there was no Duclos letter in sight at that time, but he said during this Browder period, "Tell them anything, what is the difference? It is not going to stay put anyway; they won't know the difference. When the right time comes the party will become"-it was way over my head; I didn't know what he was talking about. I talked of some of the writings of Browder at that time. He thought at the end of the meeting I had done a fairly good job, but it was of no consequence, meant nothing; and the party was aware this was only temporary, just one sidestep before stepping forward.
Mr. DOYLE. What was the sidestep?
Mr. WEREB. This cooperative period of Browder. It was in my mind-to the best of my judgment, sir, it was nothing but a sham until the war was over, that they could get all they possibly could from this country and then they would turn and become the same old revolutionary brigands they have ever been.
Mr. SCHERER. I wonder if we can apply a little of that philosophy to the present world situation.
Mr. WEREB. They took a step back this time, sir. Marxist philosophy is you can't always march forward; sometimes take a step sidewise, retreat 1 step to gain 4 steps. As far as I am concerned, this smiling and wearing of the 10-gallon hat in my estimation is a lot of hokum: something to make a lot of good, honest, decent thinking Americans sleep and think, well, manana is here and we are all all right now; he is fine. That is my personal opinion. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1817 
Mr. SCHERE. The reason I asked the question, I wondered if we can draw any conclusions from what you said- 
Mr. WEBEB. I hoped you would.
Mr. SCHERER. With present-day conditions.
Mr. W7EREB. I had hoped you would, Congressman. Next was Merle Brodsky M-e-r-l-e B-r-o-d-s-k-y, active in one of the east side groups and also a delegate from one of the east side groups. Elmer Averbuck, A-v-e-r-b-u-c-k, a stuttering, tall fellow, active also in the Hollywood group. Now comes Shevy Wallace, at one time member of the Rhetta group, and then finally a full-time employee of the county Communist Party. (At this point Representative Jackson entered the hearing room.)
Mr. WEREB. Trudy Siminov, T-r-u-d-y S-i-m-i-n-o-v. She was an employee, I believe, of the Yugoslav Relief Committee, the Joint AntiFascist Refugee Committee, and then she worked for the county part time. She was also a delegate to all the county functions and the functionaries meetings. Barbara Morley, M-o-r-l-e-y, full-time paid employee of the Los Angeles County Communist Party. Frances Stapp, S-t-a-p-p, of the Hollywood group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that a man or woman ?
Mr. WEREB. That is a woman, F-r-a-n-c-e-s. Pettis Perry, a man who headed the colored commission, very active at the CIO hall most of the time. Delphine Smith, D-e-l-p-h-i-n-e Smith. She was very active in the Long Beach and Wilmington area and San Pedro area. I think she worked in the shipyards for a while. Frances Lynn. I knew her just as a delegate.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that individual a man or woman?
Mr. WEREB. Woman; L-y-n-n. It might be L-y-n, but we used the name Lynn most of the time for her in our reports. Ola Pacifico, 0-1-a P-a-c-i-f-i-c-o, the employee of the county who was discharged from the health department because she would not sign the non-Communist oath. Sally Chriss, previously mentioned as a member of the Redondo group. Frank Spector, S-p-e-c-t-o-r, an oldtimer; made the papers a lot of times. Ken Ostreimer, O-s-t-r-e-i-m-e-r, male. Ben Richman. This Ben Richman was also one of the proponents and instigators from the group around the-I cannot recall that area right now, near the West Lake group in the American Veterans' Committee. He was active at putting on parties at his home for the benefit of the Communist Party and the Peoples World. Al Richmond, R-i-c-h-m-o-n-d. He is a Smith Act conviction from the Peoples World. George Sandy, the man I have previously mentioned as a full-time employee or organizer for the Los Angeles County Communist Party. Ester Miller Sazer, illegal entry into the country from Canada, the best I can remember. She went by two names: Miller and Sazer both.
Mr. MOITLDER. Can you further identify the people by the name of Richmond?
Mr. WEREB. Which Richmond, Al or Ben? 1818 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CAtIP., AREA 
Mr. MoULDEn. There was a Richman.
Mr. WEREB. Richman was the man that was active in the AVC movement; Richmond was the editor of the Peoples World in San Francisco.
Mr. MOULDEn. What was his full name
Mr. WERE. Al.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you know where he lived? 
Mr. WEREB. He lived in San Francisco. He was convicted under the Smith Act.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe Sazer was the last. 
Mr. WEREB. That is the illegal entry into the county, the Sazer woman. Judy Schmidt, S-c-h-m-i-d-t, for a time full-time employee of the Peoples World. Al Sherman, S-h-e-r-m-a-n, Hollywood group. Miriam Brook Sherman, wife, very active and constant delegate. According to one of her speeches, she was given a trip to Russia to see Stalin because she recruited more members into the Communist Party than anyone in the Los Angeles County, so her reward was a trip to see Stalin.
Mr. SCHERER. Do you know whether she got to see him or not?
Mr. WEREB. She stated that she did. It was only through her story and what she repeated to the functionaries group is where I got my information.
Mr. DOYLE. Where did she make that statement?
Mr. WEREB. She made that at 2200 East Seventh Street sometime in August of 1945.
Mr. SCHERER. Was she impressed ?
Mr. WEREB. I guess she was. She was rather a big figure in the Hollywood Communist group. She was very influential. Walter Smith, male; in the San Pedro area. (At this point, Representative Moulder left the hearing room.)
Mr. WEREB. Jane Sniffen, S-n-i-f-f-e-n. This is a woman who belonged to a group, but I could not tell you what group she belonged to. I had seen her a number of times at functionaries meetings, but it seemed like I always tried to find out who somebody else was. I had her pegged already, so it was all right. Loretta Stack of San Francisco, I believe, and she was also known as Starvus. She is the woman that got up at this meeting I have reference to and stated that the workers of the United States would be the gravediggers of the capitalist government of this country. Also received quite an ovation.
Mr. DOLE. Where was that?
Mr. WEREB. At 2200 West Seventh Street, the second section of the California Communist convention. I believe it was in August of 1945.
Mr. DoYLE. Will you make it clear to me how high up the ladder of Communist functionaries she was?
Mr. WEREB. She was one of the State committee members.
Mr. DOYLE. State of California ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. Was there any way, Witness, of you knowing whether these people who made these statements did so with conviction and sincerity, or were they merely going through a ritual? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1819 
Mr. WEREB. At a Communist Party functionary meeting, sir, you only say the policy of the party. You do not repeat any irresponsible self-thought or self-induced speeches or ideas. You repeat only the party policy, especially when you are holding a position as high as she has held.
Mr. SCHERER. That is what I meant, whether it was merely a ritual or repetition of party policy, or whether these people actually were convinced. Of course, it is difficult for you to look into somebody's mind, I know that; but from your wide experience and acquaintance with these individuals, I was wondering whether or not you came to any conclusions as to whether they were actually revolutionaries at heart or whether they were merely repeating a ritual or policy of the party in line with what was expected of them.
Mr. WEREB. Might I explain this way: She was also 1 of the 14 convicted in Federal courts in this country, in this State, under the Smith Act.
Mr. SCHERER. That certainly answers my question as to her.
Mr. WEREB. Anna Tenoyucca, T-e-n-o-y-u-c-c-a. I believe she was one of the Spanish or Mexican descent delegates, or of the Mexican group-I am not too sure. Harry Bennett, B-e-n-n-e-t-t, of the Terrace Communist group. That is an East Side group. His wife, Sophia, S-o-p-h-i-a, Bennett. Charlotte, C-h-a-r-l-o-t-t-e, Benoitte, B-e-n-o-i-t-t-e-just known as a delegate, did not have too much time with her.
Mrs. Bud Blair, this is the wife of the chairman of the industrial section of the South Side section of the Communist Party. Carl Brant, B-r-a-n-t. He was labor chairman of the Los Angeles County labor group; also chairman of this meeting.
Mr. TAVENNE. The committee endeavored to subpena Mr. Brant for this hearing but was unable to serve the subpena. Do you have any other information about his activities in the Communist Party?
Mr. WEREB. I do, sir. And this is where I believe that the honorable Congressmen would be very much interested as to the violence put into practice by the Communist Party.
Mr. SCHEREB. May I interrupt, Mr. Chairman? This witness certainly has been on the stand a long time and must be tired. Is there not some way we could give him a little recess and call some other witness in the meantime and then bring him back? He has been on the stand a couple of hours before lunch and now also another hour.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I would like for him to proceed a little further, if you do not mind. Will you tell us about Carl Brant?
Mr. WEREB. In the fall-rather, the early part of the winter of 1946, I believe it was near Christmas, we were given instruction by the chairmen of our groups to attend a meeting held at the Templar Hall, which is located just west of Jefferson, west of Vermont Avenue on Jefferson Boulevard. The meeting ordinarily for a functionits ary group, has always been designated-it is designated as to nature, whether a Peoples World drive, membership drive, or whatever drive this is. This was nameless. Only the South Side section, including the San Pedro area, the Long Beach area, Wilmington, was called to this meeting. 1820 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA The meeting was chaired by Bud Blair, the section chairman. He started off by reading off some Peoples World drives, which were absolutely impertinent to what we were called for. A few minutes after we started speaking of the Peoples World progress, a man walked in whom I knew to be a Communist for a long time, Carl Brant. He was also the head of a union that was on strike at that time at the United States Motors located near Slausson and Avalon Boulevards, I believe two blocks west. Bud Blair introduced Carl Brant to the group; that Carl Brant would have something very serious to say to this group. Everyone sat back and listened. He said, "Comrades"Mr. TAVENNER. Who said this ? 
Mr. WEREB. Carl Brant. He now was addressing this meeting. He said, "Comrades, there has been by the superior court in the county of Los Angeles an order issued limiting the pickets. This is unfair, a screwy decision, and we are not going to stand by and take it. Therefore tomorrow morning each and every one of you recruit, bring out all the husky manpower you possibly can because we are going to boot the hell out of the Los Angeles police and we are going to break that order."
Mr. SCHERER. I wonder what becomes of all of the assertions and statements that we hear before this committee by certain witnesses; namely, that we should leave these matters up to the courts and that they will abide by the decisions of the courts, and they are not interested in the conclusions of this committee. It seems that when they get into court the same reasoning applies to court decisions and the attitudes of courts as it does to the activities of this committee. I just wanted to make that observation.
Mr. WEREB. He said, "This is the time for Communist action. You have mobilized, you have learned to mobilize. Now we are going to put mobilization into force."
Mr. DOYLE. How many men were there?
Mr. WEREB. The following morning, sir, I went out, being Peoples World director.
Mr. DOYLE. How many were at this meeting?
Mr. WEREE. I would say 30 people.
Mr. DOYLE. Any women? 
Mr. WEREB. Yes, there were, because there were functionaries, women functionaries in the group; women can recruit and mobilize as well as men can, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. This incident which he is relating demonstrates to me clearly the value of having informants within that group because I am sure that before he had concluded the police department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation knew the intention of that group to mobilize against the police.
Mr. DOYLE. In any sense, was this a Communist closed meeting or union?
Mr. WEREn. This was a Communist functionary meeting of the South Side industrial section; there was no one else but Communists there. I believe Alice Ward, Nemmy Spark's wife, was one. I believe Elsie Mancar, secretary of the Mine, Mill and Smelters Workers Union, was present. There were a number of other people. At the present time I am too much occupied in my mind to relate who were there. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1821 
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, here was a bunch of 35 or 40 Communists planning to do something on the picket line.
Mr. WEREB. The idea, sir, was we were going to break the police line.
Mr. SCHERER. Violate the order of the court.
Mr. DOTLE. Violate the order of the court and bring reputable organized labor into disrepute.
Mr. WEREB. The following morning I was on the picket line with the manpower we mobilized. The police department had a hundred or more policemen out there in the morning, and at 7 o'clock the parade started. In spite of the police loudspeaker warnings, the parade started down Lawson Avenue going west; I would say 1,500 people. This was led by 2 people. They spearheaded this. One was Philip Connelly. This Philip Connelly was convicted of the Smith Act in this trial in Los Angeles, and this man Carl Brant. They came at the head of this and defied the police, defied all of the people-all its lawmakers-and they were going to have violence, and they did have violence. There were a number of heads broken, tear gas. There was fighting, there was general rioting.
Mr. JACKSON. The usual police brutality, isn't that the expression? That is how it was reported in the paper, Cossacks attack the innocent workers and violenceMr. WEREB. I took refuge in the railroad yards, over the back fence. I am not young, but I made it. I wanted no tear gas or police.
Mr. SCHERER. How many joined the picket line ?
Mr. WEREB. I would say 1,500; I do not say all Commies.
Mr. SCHERER. Three hundred less than picketed us last month in Newark.
Mr. WEREB. That demonstrated to me violence and bloodshed as taught by Marxism and Leninism. It was a method of carrying out defiance of legal authority.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, here were two known Communists leading a group of American working men and women, most of whom probably had no idea that the Communist Party was leading them down the road.
Mr. WEREB. That is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Again bringing reputable labor in my State in disrepute.
Mr. WEREB. That is right. This was just one of the instances of bringing out mobilization, bringing out force, bringing out violencebecause I could not describe it better, I could not conscientiously in my own mind justify it any other way but an actual revolutionary step. I can be told by authorities not to do so, and the reason I am told that is because a law was enacted by the greatest majority of the people through the representatives for that, and when I defy that I know I am doing the wrong thing. And they knew, because the police came with loudspeakers and warned them that they are acting against the orders of the court and that if they dispersed there would be no trouble. But instead of dispersing, these two men led this groupand most naturally, most of the front people were Communists.
Mr. SCHERER. Instead of following the procedures prescribed by the Constitution which they pretend to defend in these hearings and appealing the decision of that court through the procedures prescribed, they took the law into their own hands and violated the order of the court. 65500-55-pt 4-4 1822 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WEREB. This was one of the instances, sir. I would appreciate about a 10 minute recess.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I ask you one question first. The Philip Connelly you referred to as being one of the two leaders of this group, do you recall whether or not he served a jail sentence on the charge of inciting a riot ?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, he did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Relating to this very matter? 
Mr. WEREB. Yes, he did, sir. There were about 15 people of the leadership of that group who served sentences, but I stayed out of that mostly because I did not want to get involved. There was a chance for me to be uncovered, so I stepped back and stayed away. There were chances there of being uncovered, and I could not take that.
Mr. DOYLE. The committee will stand in recess 5 minutes. (Whereupon, a short recess was taken.)
Mr. DOYLE. Come to order. Let the record show that a legal quorum of the subcommittee is here, Mr. Jackson, of California; Mr. Scherer, of Ohio; and Mr. Doyle, of California.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Wereb, you were answering a few questions I had asked you regarding Carl Brandt. Will you proceed now with giving of the names of the functionaries of the Communist Party who attended the meeting regarding the Duclos letter ?
Mr. WEREB. We had one Archie Brown, who at one time ran for Governor of the State of California on the Communist Party ticket. Rose Chernin, convicted in the Smith Act. Philip Connelly, convicted in the Smith Act. Ben Dobbs, convicted, Smith Act. Dr. Hy Engelberg. This next name I am going to omit because this woman was not at that meeting. That was Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. She was at another meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you do not place her at that meeting?
Mr. WEREB. Not at that particular meeting. She was at another meeting and somehow this name got into this wrong place. She was one of the national committeemen, I think, of the Communist Party of the United States. Jim Forrest-he was the chairman and organizer in the Long Beach area of the Communist Party. Leon Ginsberg, functionary from the west side. Shirley Gray, functionary, I don't recall from what club at this time. Henry Steinberg, convicted in the Smith Act. Jane Swanhauser. She is of the Hollywood group, I believe, a functionary, and very active in the People's World drive. She was very active in membership committee drives. James Talley, a functionary of the Central Avenue section. Frank Kadish, member of the county committee of the Los Angeles party. Pat Kiloran. Pat Kiloran I believe was also a reporter for the People's World. Eva Korn-she assisted very often besides her functionary work, she assisted at the county offices with literature work, mimeographing, mailing, and whatnot. Rudy Lambert. convicted, Smith case. Ring Lardner, Jr., was supposed to have been at the first section, not the second section I am speaking of now. He should have been mentioned as present at the first section at the Danish Hall. Albert Lima, convicted, Smith Act. George Lohr, representing, I believe, the San Diego area. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1823 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, that is the same individual that we learned during the San Diego hearings was in Czechoslovakia. He is in Czechoslovakia now. All right, go ahead.
Mr. WEREB. Jack Moss. I omitted two names until later for other purposes. Those two were not present at that meeting. Fletcher Nester, father-in-law or father of Dorothy Healey, convicted under the Smith Act, not Fletcher Nester but Dorothy Healey was. Sophie Nester. These are the names. There are more names I have but these are names of those people who were at the southern section of the California Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have been asking you what functionary meetings -ofthe Communist Party you attended and this one in which you have named all these functionaries was one of them. Were there any other functionary meetings that you attended?
Mr. WEREB. Yes; there were, sir. I recall one functionary meeting in the early part of 1947. At this meeting ,there were 2 within 3 weeks, large functionary meetings that were held at 2200 East Seventh Street. I think it was known as the Park Manor. There at the first meeting William Schneiderman instructed all functionaries due to the trouble he is having with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the police department, and other stool-pigeon agencies as he called them, he no longer wants any contact with party members by mail, telephone; the correct names are no longer necessary to be used. If you have any new member or a recruit as they would call them you are to take them to places of integration personally and see that they were integrated into their Marxist classes or into the groups to which they will be assigned, be it labor, be it language, or be it arts or whatever group that they had work in. He seemed very, very much dissatisfied with the treatment the American people were giving the Communist Party and he urged that there would be a doublecheck on all members, there would be a security check on everybody and that this check would include a very severe Marxist program and this Marxist program would include all labor leaders and those who are active in their union to be given special Marxist training and that no longerMr. SCHERER. Just a minute.
Mr. WEREB. May I finish the sentence?
Mr. SCHERER. To keep the record straight, when you said give these instructions to all leaders in labor unions, you mean leaders who were already members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right. You broke my thought there.
Mr. SCHRER. It sounded too bad on the record.
Mr. WEREB. He said that labor union men who might think that their position in the party as Communists would jeopardize their position in the union, they no longer would have to be known as Communists. That was the sum and substance of the security meeting of that group.
Mr. SCHERER. YOU mean they wouldn't have to disclose their identity, those groups would go underground ?
Mr. WEEB. Especially in labor movement or labor leadership.
Mr. SOHERER. You said this was a rather rigid security check?
Mr. WEREB. Yes, it was. The order was to conduct a rigid security check. 1824 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you given your security check following that meeting?
Mr. WEREB. Very shortly. I want no more.
Mr. SCHERER. Were members dismissed as a result of that security check?
Mr. WEREB. They would be tried by a security group or security body and then if the party found that they were antagonistic to the party or they were not loyal or were not willing to go down the full line of the party, they would be tried in absentia or within their presence, didn't make a bit of difference, and they would be listed by the party as enemies of labor, stool pigeons of capitalism and they would tag them, they would manage to hang a tag or some type on them whereby that individual was no longer accepted by capital or by labor.
Mr. TAVENNER. The party felt for its own safety and security it had to expel those from its list those who were not loyal to the party?
Mr. WEREB. That is correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I am wondering today when the United States Government is doing the same thing, expelling from its employ persons who it feels are security risks, why there is such a hue and cry about that type of check by this same group who did the same thing to protect the Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask this: I understood you to say that these Communist Party members were tried for security clearance even in their absence. 
Mr. WEREB. They were triedMr. DOYLE. You said in absentia.
Mr. WEREB. In other words, they didn't have to be present at the trial.
Mr. DOYLE. They always got notice of the trial, I hope.
Mr. WEREB. Yes; they did, but ordinarily it wasn't very complimentary, they would get it in a roundabout way in such a way as to destroy their standing in the union, in their job.
Mr. DOYLE. Did they get a bill of particulars or complaint?
Mr. WEREB. That was always prewritten, always the same charge, as being an enemy to the masses. That was the general charge and- 
Mr. DOYLE. Very indefinite.
Mr. WEREB. They didn't care about any points that were definite. You were just an enemy to the masses of the people and therefore you were expelled or you were tagged or you were eliminated. There was another class-may I proceed ? There was another class within 3 weeks or so of this security class, which was chaired by Dorothy Healy. Dorothy Healy reminded us of the meeting 3 weeks previous and agreed fully that the worst, that there were spies in the organization, there were disruptions, anything that didn't please them was a disruption. There was opportunism, that is another tag they would hang on somebody, an opportunist, and you were dead. Of course saying dead would be just as a member. This meeting, she proposed another group, some of them of this first bunch that were present and then I have other names that were present at this other class or group for instruction and she told the functionaries not to use the mail, not to contact by phone, but all strikes are to be Communist led and they are to be controlled by the Communist Party. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1825 The progress of the strike was to be reported to the county board from time to time as to its progress or no progress. She urged that there would be mass meetings of disruption of proceedings, disorderly conduct, and what-not, at shop gates, open Communist meetings or progressive meetings, shall we say, on street corners, that Congressmen were to be picketed at their homes in case they enacted legislation contrary to the welfare of the party.
Mr. DOYLE. The Communist Party ?
Mr. WEREB. That is right. Would you mind if I refresh my mind on that meeting? I have a note or two here which I would like to bring out. I hate to delay. She also urged that every one would be doubly checked again for Marxist and Leninist training. She demanded the reinstitution of all Leninist programs. A Leninist program was the means of carrying out revolution. It wasn't Marxist so much, it was the Leninist program she was driving at.
Mr. DOYLE. What woman was that?
Mr. WEREB. Dorothy Healy, the head of the Los Angeles County Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. Where is she today ?
Mr. WEREB. She has been convicted under the Smith Act, the trial here 2 years ago. All recruiting must be very careful as to who they recruit. There should be a concentration on labor leaders and these labor leaders are to have their training quietly and according to the set rules of the party.
Mr. DoYLE. Why do they try to get top labor leaders in to the Communist conspiracy? They seem to put more effort on that than any other group.
Mr. WEREB. I believe the best way I can explain that, sir, is that labor everywhere in the world I believe at one time or other has had some uneasy experiences and if you want to talk to a man, I will give you a for instance here, if you want to talk to a man about a traffic cop, all you have to do is talk to a fellow who already has a ticket and you have got a sour apple. There were some people at one time or other that had been discharged from their jobs or they had been laid off from their work, and they didn't have the best of everything we have. Most naturally they were easiest to prey on. They would do things for their own welfare and not know what they were doing because the Communist Party didn't go after membership in large numbers. Their power was not in numbers. Their power was in a close-knit well organized group whereby in leadership, in government, everywhere else-she also said at this meeting that the industries to concentrate on would be aviation, shipping, transportation, communications, I believe she covered those pretty darn well, all basic industries.
Mr. IOTLE. In other words, the industries that the Communist conwe spiracy would want to weaken or destroy or handicap in the event were attacked by a foreign enemy. that.
Mr. WERE. It would be necessary that they control
Mr. DOYLE. I think some of these young people, and the older people in this room, ought to hear this witness with their ears open pretty wide.
Mr. SCHERER. I think it should be pointed out that this testimony of this witness here isn't isolated testimony. We have heard this story 1826 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA from witnesses from one end of this country to the other, same type of testimony.
Mr. DOYLE. That is right.
Mr. SCHERER. I wouldn't want some people who are hearing it for the first time to think this is something new.
Mr. TAVENNER. At this point will you give us the names of individuals who attended either of these two meetings which you said were held 1 or 2 weeks apart or additional functionary meetings; then possibly at a later time we will come back to a further discussion of what took place at these meetings.
Mr. WEREB. I would say further, sir, that there was a person by the name of "H," that is the only initial I have, Tilles.
Mr. TAvENNER. What about her?
Mr. WEREB. She was a functionary of the Communist Party from some district which I wasn't aware of at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. What meeting was it?
Mr. WEREB. This is the second meeting I have reference to now, second meeting of the security meeting which was chaired by Dorothy Healy, not the one chaired by Schneiderman. E. C. Twine, this man was from the Central Avenue District and he has had a prison record once or twice, I believe.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you make it clear for us what meeting this is?
Mr. WEREB. This is that second meeting, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. 1947.
Mr. WEREB. 1947, early part of 1947. Harry Ultrich, also known as Uttrech, an alias. I knew the man by both names, a functionary delegate from one of the clubs. Virginia Warren. Anne Pollock. That is the spelling I have, P-o-l-l-o-c-k. Dave Warford, William Weintraub, Dave Warford was active in a labor group somewhere in, whether it was a building trades union I don't recall, but he gave his status at one of the meetings. William Weintraub, W-e-i-n-t-r-a-u-b. For a while local manager for the People's World, full time employee at that time on Second and Spring Street. Robert Wilkerson. W-i-l-k-e-r-s-o-n. Charles Gladstone, also known as Charles Young. He was from the Garment Workers group. Gertrude Staughton, S-t-a-u-g-h-t-o-n. She was from I believe. Hlo'lvwood. I wouldn't know for sure at this time. Nathan Shapiro, district manager in the north end of town for People's World and a functionary delegate to most of the meetings. Anne Bilan, a delegate from one of the group, I don't recall right at the present moment. Irving Goldman, a recent transfer at that time from the Young Communist League who had reached the age where he was too old for the Young Communist League, and it was H9 turn to take part and take action duty in the Communist Party. He lived within about six blocks of my residence, he and his wife both belonged there. Don Healy. This man was formerly husband of Dorothy Healy, whom I mentioned as the Smith case. Larue McCormick. She belonged to an east side group, I am not sure if it was the Watts Club or not. She at one time, I believe, ran for city council or something, some little office, didn't amount to anything.
Mr. JACKSON. City council of what? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1827 
Mr. WEREB. I believe it was either Watts or that district in there. I am not too sure of that but I know she ran for some office. At one time she ran for the board of education too and she flopped there. Cliff Houdeck, H-o-u-d-e-c-k, a functionary delegate. Ed Hollingshead. Ed Hollingshead was the watchdog of the party. He would manage to hang about the CIO hall most of the time and find some one who was anti-Communist or didn't exactly like the party and he was there to cause all the trouble and all the headaches at one time. He was known as their security officer at large. They had two, you know. Hershel Alexander, Watts group, very active functionary, also a member of the southwest industrial group. (Representative Jackson left the hearing room.)
Mr. WEREB. Harden Westman, for a time People's World director and district manager for People's World in Inglewood District. Martha Hard, functionary delegate from one club, I don't recall which club at this time. Shevey Wallace. This Shevey Wallace is the one I had reference to as a full time employee of the Los Angeles County Communist Party. Those are about all the names that I have for that meeting, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, this witness has been on the stand all day. There are more questions that I would like to ask him but I would prefer to pass it over until tomorrow morning and proceed with other witnesses at this time.
Mr. DOYLE. We begin tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.
Mr. DOYLE. Is that satisfactory to you, sir?
Mr. WEREB. Very satisfactory. 
Mr. DonE. You are excused until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. Thank you.
Mr. WEREB. Thank you, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. James Burford. 
Mr. DOYLE. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God
Mr. BURFORD. I do. 
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you. Be seated, please. (Representative Jackson returned to the hearing room.) TESTIMONY OF JAMES BURFORD, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, LEON BRONTON, JR.
