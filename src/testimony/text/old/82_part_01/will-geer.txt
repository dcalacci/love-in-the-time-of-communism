Mr. TAVENNER. Who is your agent?
Mr. GEER. Paul Wilkins, 9006 Sunset Boulevard.
Mr. TAVENNER. With whom did you contract? 
Mr. GEER. Contracted with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you negotiate yourself with any of the officials ?
Mr. GEER. We have agents in the business. They do all the nego- tiating. We are just entertainers, and they sell us and get 10 percent of us. Our ashes we will them.

Mr. GEER. No; not at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your employment prior to that picture to which you referred ?
Mr. GEER. A picture called Lights Out, at Universal Studio, which is about a blind war veteran. I played the father-the boy's adjust- ment to coming back to life after being blinded in the war.

Mr. GEER. Universal Studio at Universal City, Calif. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date of that employment? 
Mr. GEER. The date of that employment was-let's see, would be roughly, well, that would be about October, I guess. After that I did a picture at Columbia.

Mr. GEER. Just to make an appearance and see whether they thought I was a fit subject for the particular role they had in mind.  INDUSTRY 179 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you furnish any references of any character to those studios in connection with your employment ?
Mr. GEER. References?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. GEER. I don't understand that question, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I said did you furnish any references to those stu- dios in connection with your employment in those two contracts?
Mr. GEER. I have been in the theater for about 25 years,-sir. I think I am well enough known to all of them from the roles I. have played. 
Mr. TAVENNER. You felt that was not necessary?
Mr. GEER. I don't believe so; no.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever furnished references to the studios with which you sought to make contracts ?
Mr. GEER. No. I think a person's work is usually the judge of whether you get a part or not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; after 25 years; but you have to have a beginning place, some place along the line. So I am asking you if at any time you did that.
Mr. GEER. Well, I don't believe so. It is always a question of which comes first, the hen or the egg, about an actor getting a job. You get the job or the egg or the hen which hatches first. - Mr. TAVENNER. Will you answer my question as to whether or not you furnished references to any studio in connection with your employment?
Mr. GEER. No; I never felt it necessary, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you do it?
Mr. GEER. No. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Whether you felt it necessary or not, did you ?
Mr. GEER. No. We just make an appearance and we are sold likeMr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California? 
Mr. GEER. The last 21/2 years, in Santa Monica.
Mr. TAVENNER. And prior to that time where did you live ?
Mr. GEER. I have a farm in Rockland County, in the Hudson Valley, New York State. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And how long did you live in New York State?
Mr. GEER. Ten years. Long enough to get the farm, the home. It is a blueberry farm.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you in the State of New York in the theatrical profession ?
Mr. GEER. Well, I would say off and on. Of course, New York is a center of show business, so we naturally gravitate there for jobs. I imagine since the year 1924 I have gone to New York off and on. Sometimes you would go on tour all over the country, and again we would be in New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. First I will ask you whether you were living in the State of New York in 1942?
Mr. GEER. 1942. I imagine so: Let's see. I was campaigning for Wendell Willkie along about that time. I don't know whether it was 1942 or not. No, Wendell Willkie died.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you also interested at that time in the Communist Party, as indicated by your signing of a Communist Party independent nominating petition July 23, 1942? 81595-51-pt. 1-9 180 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. GEER. 1942? 
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of what purports. to be such a petition.
Mr. GEER. Well, that, gentlemen, is an emotional, hysterical ques- tion based on the date. I stand on my rights, the fifth amendment, on the grounds it might incriminate or degrade me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I ask you again to look at the Communist Party nominating petition which I hand you and state whether or not the name Will Geer appears on that petition, and if so whether or not it is your signature.
Mr. GEER. I stand on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to file the document in evidence and ask that it be marked "Geer Exhibit No. 1." (The document referred to above was marked "Geer Exhibit No. 1.)1
Mr. GEER. 1942? This is 1951. Actors are so gabby, I beg four pardon.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1942?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean you stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment?
Mr. GEER. Well, it might incriminate or degrade me. The word "Communist" is an emotional, hysterical word of the day, like the word "witch" in Salem.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you refusing to answer the question because you consider it an emotional and hysterical matter ? Is that the grounds of your refusal, or is it some other ground ?
Mr. GEER. On the grounds of tending to incriminate.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you are refusing to answer the question because to do so might tend to incriminate you ?
Mr. GEER. Incriminate.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you place your refusal to answer squarely upon that ground ?
Mr. GEER. Upon that ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee the basis for your refusal to answer that question or give the committee some information upon which it may judge whether or not to answer that question might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. GEER. I answered that question on the advice of counsel and refused it.
Mr. TAVENNER. So you refuse to furnish any information to the committee upon which it may act or judgeAr. GEER. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). The requirement of your answering that question? I have before me an issue of October 20, 1936, of the Daily Worker, in which there is an article under the title "Miner Talks in the Bronx Tomorrow." In the body of this article appears this language: All the members and friends of the Jewish Bureau of the Communist Party and the Furriers Union which have endorsed Gold's candidacy have been asked to attend this meeting, the Bronx County Committee of the Communist Party announced. Chairman of the meeting will be Harry Yerris, county secretary, 1 Retained in committee files.  INDUSTRY 181 who will open the gathering with brief introductory remarks. In addition to the speaking, an elaborate program has been arranged, featuring Will Geer. Do you recall that meeting?
Mr. GEER. I refuse to answer the question on the same grounds of the fifth amendment, because. it is an emotional question, out of date.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS your answer based upon the date of the docu- ment ? Is that the basis of your refusal?
Mr. GEER. On the grounds of the fifth amendment, as I have already stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then place your refusal on the grounds that you actually rely upon. I have before me the September 25, 1945, issue of the Daily Worker, in which there appears an article entitled "Thousand Artists, Writers Back Davis," and I read as follows: Formation of an artists, writers, and professionals group for the election of Benjamin J. Davis was announced yesterday by Paul Robeson, chairman of the new group. More than 1,000 citizens, including some of the most outstanding in the theater, radio, and motion pictures, fine arts, dance, publishing, literature, educational and allied fields have already joined the division which will actively campaign for the reelection of Davis. And then further in the article appears the statement of those who were connected with the formation of that group, in which this language is used, "also Howard De Silva"; and then naming numerous others. And finally in the list the name of Will Geer appearsMr. GEER. Among a thousand.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). As a signer. Did you participate in the formation of that organization?
Mr. GEER. I claim the privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. What privilege?
Mr. GEER. On the grounds of incrimination. Fifth Amendment. Incrimination, fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you entertain at any meetings of the Communist Party or branches of the Communist Party other than the matters I have already referred to?
Mr. GEER. Ancient history. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. On the grounds of the fifth amendment or ancient history ?
Mr. GEER. Well, on the amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. To answer the question might tend to incriminate you ? Is that what you mean ?
Mr. GEER. Correct, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Since so much emphasis has been placed by you on the question of ancient history, are you a member of the Communist Party now
Mr. GEER. I refuse to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Ancient history?
Mr. GEER. No; same grounds.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Geer, we can get along a lot faster if you will make your answers responsive to the questions that are asked you.
Mr. GEER. I will try to, sir.
Mr. WooD. It will help the committee a lot and save a lot of time.
Mr. GEER. I will do my best. 182 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Geer, I have before me an April 27, 1948, issue of the Daily Worker, in which under the column "Broadway Beat" there is an article relating to you entitled "Actor's Reply to Columnist" I will read the first paragraph and then go down into the body about a matter which I want to ask you about. Will Geer sounds off in a letter to the editor of a theater publication. We see that a certain columnist has attempted to slough off unemployment in our theater by attacking what he calls the censorship of the artist in the Soviet Union. He tblls a discouraged actor to beware of casting envious glances at the good employment of the Soviet actor because some Soviet composers have just been criticized by the Soviet state. Then in the body of the article appears this statement attributed to you: The clucking that has gone on about control of the Soviet composer has been largely hearsay. He is unaware apparently of the Soviet cultural program. As an American who has worked in the Soviet theater and cinema, I am all for government participation in show business. Over a period of 25 years the Soviet theater has given infinitely more variety than has been evidenced in the London or New York stages. It has given year-round work for the artist, vacations with pay, free day's salaries to young students of the theater. Whenever I write to the young would-be artists of the theater that have given up probably or have been unable to afford study, I am reminded of the young actor I talked to in Moscow before the war. He was to enroll as a student at the Trade Union Theater, a theater of repertory that was largely supported by trade-unionists of a ball bearing factory. I asked him-if he was just starting out. "Oh, no. I have spent one season already in the Realistic Theater and one in the Molle Theater"- and so forth. Were you correctly quoted in that article ?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did that article correctly reflect your views about government participation in the show businessMr. GEER. Thanks for reading it, but I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). At the time it was alleged to have been made by you ? 
Mr. GEER. I stand on the same privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. That you refuse to answer ? 
Mr. WooD. The reporter can't get your indication.
Mr. GEER. I am sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. When were you in Russia
Mr. GEER. I went on a theatrical tour to see the Moscow Art Festival in 1935.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that the first time that you had been to Moscow ?
Mr. GEER. It was. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The first time you had been in the Soviet Union?
Mr. GEER. It was, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it the only time you have been there ?
Mr. GEER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the purpose of your trip ?
Mr. GEER. To see the theaters. Our theater was in a pretty bad state at this time. It was a repertory theater.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you go alone ?
Mr. GEER. I went alone.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you go in a representative capacity of any character ? COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 183 
Mr. GEER. No; just the theater festival tour.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did you pay all of your own expenses, or were part of your expenses contributed ?
Mr. GEER. Paid my own expenses.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Harold Ware in Russia at that time? 
Mr. GEER. Not that I know of, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Harold Ware your brother-in-law ?
Mr. GEER. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you related in any manner to him ?
Mr. GEER. No, sir; not related.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your wife's name ?
Mr. GEER. Herta Ware.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she related to Harold Ware ?
Mr. GEER. I imagine she was. He has been dead for a' number of years.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was her relationship ?
Mr. GEER. I hadn't met the lady at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, the relationship would be just the same, wouldn't it, then?
Mr. GEER. It would be an in-law relationship. I don't call an in-law a relative.
Mr. TAVENNER. I asked you whether he was your brother-in-law. -Mr. GEER. Brother-in-law? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. GEER. No; he is not my brother-in-law.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the relationship of Harold Ware to your wife? 
Mr. GEER. I would call him an uncle-in-law.
Mr. TAVENNER. An uncle-in-law?
Mr. GEER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the relationship of your wife to Mother Bloor?
Mr. GEER. My wife is the granddaughter of an 88-year-old lady known as Mother Bloor to many people who have no truck with communism.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did Harold Ware have any connection of any kind with your trip to Russia. 
Mr. GEER. I have never met Harold Ware. I hadn't met my wife at the time either. I had not met my wife. (Representative Francis E. Walter left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a passport application which was obtained by the State Department by subpena duces tecum of a person by the name of Thomas Gilbert, where you appear or the name Will Geer appears as the identifying witness. Will you examine it, please ?
Mr. GEER (after examining document). What was the question you wanted to ask of me, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't recall how the question was worded, but I will now ask you whether or not you were a witness to that application.
Mr. GEER. I recognize the picture. I don't remember the name, but I certainly signed the application.
Mr. TAVENNER. And it is your signature? 184 COMMUNISM 
Mr. GEER. Yes. IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY People frequently ask for favors of that sort, recommendations.
Mr. TAVENNER. The man's name appears as Thomas Gilbert in the application. You say you recognize the photograph?
Mr. GEER. I recognize the photograph but not the name.
Mr. TAVENNER. YOU do not know him by the name of Thomas Gilbert ?
Mr. GEER. I do not. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Whose photograph is that if that is not Thomas Gilbert?
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't remember the-oh, well, I might. It has been a number of years ago. What date was that? I might have remembered the name, but we meet so many people that it is im- possible for me to connect the name with the picture.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have just told us that you did not remember him by that name. I want to know by what name you did know the individual whose picture appears there.
Mr. GEER. I just don't recognize that name.
Mr. TAVENNER. But who is the man ?
Mr. GEER. I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. You know the man ?
Mr. GEER. I know the man's face, but I do not know his name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Never heard the name Whitey Roland ?
Mr. GEER. I never heard that name. 'Mr. TAVENNER. Never heard the name Whitey Roland ?
Mr. GEER. Never heard the name-1937 is the date ?
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated in your affidavit that you had known this individual, Thomas Gilbert, for a period of 4 years.
Mr. GEER. At that time. That's 1937. At that time I probably did.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to introduce this photostatic copy into evidence and request that it be marked "Geer Exhibit No. 2." (The document referred to above was marked "Geer Exhibit No. 2.")
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you another application for passport, pur- porting to be under the name of Thomas Gilbert, a photograph attached, in which Isabel S. C. Wright appears as the identifying witness. Will you examine that application and look at the photograph of Thomas Gilbert?
Mr. GEER. I have never seen that man before.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is an entirely different photograph from the one in the application which you signed as a witness, is it not ?
Mr. GEER. I would say so, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know the person whose photograph ap- pears on the application?
Mr. GEER. I have never seenMr. TAVENNER. On the application just handed you ?
Mr. GEER. I have never seen this face before to my knowledge. I have never seen his face before.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever confer with the party whose photo- graph appears in exhibit No. 2, which was the first copy I handed you' Retained in committee files. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 185 
Mr. GEER. To my knowledge---- 
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. About his acting as a witness to an application for passport by you ? 
Mr. GEER. As far as I can recollect, never, to the best of my mem- ory. I don't believe I really understood that, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. To simplify the question, did you ever talk to the person whose photograph appears on the exhibit 2 and ask him to act as the identifying witness in an application to be filed by you ?
Mr. GEER. To the best of my knowledge, I have never seen the man.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me hand you again exhibit No. 2, which contains the photograph of the individual whose photograph you recognize.
Mr. GEER. This is No. 1 Is this exhibit No. 1?
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, it's exhibit No. 2, but it is the first of the photostats which I handed you.
Mr. GEER. You've got me all mixed up on 2's and 1's. I'm sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. That's easily understandable. So I am handing you now the application which is marked "Geer Exhibit No. 2" and contains the photograph of the person known the application, as Thomas Gilbert, and I ask you whether you at any time made an arrangement with the individual whose photograph appears there by which he was to act as the identifying witness for you if you acted as the identifying witness for him. (At this point Representative Charles E. Potter left the hearing and Representative Clyde Doyle entered the hearing.)
Mr. GEER. I believe, to the best of my recollection, sir, when I applied for a passport in 1935 my witness was a woman and had nothing to do with this person at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. I know, but will you answer my question as to whether or not you ever had conversation with the individual whose photograph appears there of the character that I mentioned to you ?
Mr. GEER. To the best of my recollection, never.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many passports have you obtained ?
Mr. GEER. In 1935, the year I went to the festival, and in 1920 I went over in a cattle boat, one of Harold Swift's cattle boats, after I got out of school, but I don't think I had to have a passport then as I remember. Maybe I did. That's about 1920. It's when I was just a kid. I remember I worked over on a cattle boat. And I have forgotten if we had to have passports or not.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the circumstances under which you signed this application which is exhibit No. 2 as an identifying witfiess ?
Mr. GEER. It's entirely vague in my mind. Someone just asked me they wanted to get a passport. People frequently come byMr. TAVENNER. Had you known the individual for 4 years?
Mr. GEER. Yes. I think he was something to do with the merchant marine or something or other. 
Mr. WOOD. Counsel, we are going to have to suspend here for about 20 minutes so the members may answer this call, and we will resume at 11: 30. (Thereupon, at 11:10 a. m,, a recess was taken until 11:45 a. m., at which time the following proceedings were had:)

Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Geer, do you know the purpose for which Thomas Gilbert sought permission to travel abroad?
Mr. GEER. To the best of my recollection, no. Just he wanted to go. He's a merchant seaman. I think I should add, if you would permit me, that I worked as a merchant seaman in between jobs on shore and naturally I met a great many seamen at that time, and there would be dozens and dozens-hundreds of people, in factthat I couldn't recall the name of and still at the same time I'd be perfectly willing to help them out on getting a reference for a job or anything of that sort. (At this point, Representative Harold H. Velde entered the hearin) GEER. Gr. (continuing). At the same time, you wouldn't remember their name but you'd know their face.
Mr. TAVENNER. You don't mean that you would sign an identi- fying affidavit that you had known a person for 4 years if you hadn't known him, would you ?
Mr. GEER. I certainly wouldn't.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, can you state whether or not the person whose photograph appears on exhibit No. 2. which I will hand to you again, is a person who was known to you by the name of Roland?
Mr. GEER. No, I have no recollection about the name whatever. The face does look familiar. Just as the face of a lady in the back court there I hadn't seen for 20 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer in evidence the second passport application and ask that it be marked "Exhibit Geer 3."
Mr. WooD. It will be admitted. I thought it was admitted al- ready. (The document referred to was marked "Exhibit Geer 3.") 1
Mr. TAVENNER. And also the other excerpts from the papers which I read in evidence, namely, the issue of the Daily Worker of October 20, 1936, [p. 4], which I ask be marked "Exhibit Geer 4," and of the Daily Worker of April 27, 1948, [p. 16], which I asked be marked "Exhibit Geer 5."
Mr. WooD. They may be marked. (The documents referred to were marked "Exhibits Geer 4 and Geer 5," respectively.) 2
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Geer, were you a member of or affiliated in any way with the American Peace Mobilization?
Mr. GEER. Well, there are about four or five hundred organiza- tions listed as being here, and I'd have to really consult this book to find out.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO find out whether you were a member ?
Mr. GEER. No. To find out whether it's-what it's listed. are several hundred organizations. 1 There It is difficult to remember the Retained in committee files. a See appendix following conclusion of hearings printed under this title. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 187 names of them, as it is difficult to remember the names of people.

Mr. TAVENNER. What difference does it make, in answer to the question of whether or not you were a member, as to whether it's listed in a book ?
Mr. GEER. I simply list all things like this as an-emotional words used in a time that is altogether-it is like

Mr. GEER. No. I just simply stand on the grounds of the amendment. 'Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you refuse to answer on the grounds that to do soMr. GEER. Might incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. GEER. Those things are years ago.
Mr. KEARNEY. That is again a period of ancient history, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. GEER. Yes. At the present time, hospital benefits. I play vet- erans' hospitals. A little group goes around and plays veterans' hospitals. For all I know they might be listed in another 6 months as something altogether out of order. Things change very rapidly nowadays.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time a sponsor of the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace?
Mr. GEER. The name doesn't sound familiar, but I'd like-I really don't recall the name of that one, sir. I am sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. It was held on March 25, 26, and 27 of 1949 in New York City under the sponsorship of the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions.
Mr. WooD. What is your answer?

Mr. GEER. I am, sir. I pay dues. I am a life member of the Actors' Equity Association and AFRA, radio organization. Those are the only organizations I can think of I paid dues to in my life.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever paid dues to the Communist Party ?
Mr. GEER. Decline on the grounds it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you ever questioned by officials of the mov- ing-picture industry regarding your alleged activity in Communistfront organizations-that is, organizations which have been cited as Communist fronts by the Attorney General of the United States and this committee or other committees ?
Mr. GEER. NO. They simply told me they didn't believe every- thing they read.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, they discussed the matter with you prior to your employment?
Mr. GEER. Just casually. People around the studio. I wouldn't remember the names.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was it said to you they didn't believe every- thing they read or heard ?
Mr. GEER. That's an old saying of mine too. I don't know which one. / 
Mr. TAVENNER. You quoted some official of the moving-picture in- dustry as having made that statement.
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't recall who it was, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, whom did you talk to on the subject of Com- munist-front organizations within the industry ?
Mr. GEER. I can't remember. There are many people that discuss the subject, but they would probably be in the hundreds. I couldn't possibly remember their names.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you discuss it with them at the time of your employment on any of the projects that you undertook?
Mr. GEER. TO my recollection, no, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you employed by any of the people with whom you had discussed that subject?
Mr. GEER. I imagine so.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were they?
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't recollect offhand, sir, but I would presume so because I have done 15 pictures with 4 major studios.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did any of those producers talk to you about your activities either within-alleged activities within the Communist Party or in Communist-front organizations? That is, organizations cited as being Communist-front organizations?
Mr. GEER. I discussed it with one director perhaps, and he asked me just what I was anyway, and I told him I was a conservationist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Conservationist? COMMUNISM IN' MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 189 
Mr. GEER. Conservationist, sir. That is my philosophy. I believe in returning the land to the same shape we found it in. I believe also in conserving the things that one-world Wendell Willkie talked about and F. D. R. got for us. That's my philosophy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, did he ask you about communism
Mr. GEER. No, not to my recollection. He asked me what I was anyway. That was my answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Who was that director? What was his name?
Mr. GEER. I can't recollect the name of it, the particular occasion, but I do remember making that statement, because the man happened to be opposed to F. D. R., and he didn't think much of it, whoever it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you did not tell him that you had been connected with Communist-front organizations ?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment in answering that question, sir, because I already said that that's a hysterical word.
Mr. TAVENNER. I do not see how it could tend to incriminate you to state whether or not you discussed the subject with an employer, or an employer with you.
Mr. GEER. Well, I'm-I really-that's just something casual that happens in everyday life. I have really-that's all the conversation I happen to recall on it. I say that would happen, oh, an average of once a day during the past few years, discussions with people about philosophy.
Mr. TAVENNER. I'm speaking of your employers. Did your employers discuss your activities with you daily ?
Mr. GEER. Never in connection with employment to the best of my knowledge. I would be quite willing to discuss it with them any time.
Mr. TAVENNER. More willing than you have been with this committee ?
Mr. GEER. I should say so, sir, because this is a peculiar atmosphere we are living in today. And the citizen has to see clearly all the time how important it is to preserve individual rights.
Mr. TAVENNER. You would answer then questions propounded to you by your employer as to whether or not you had been or are at the present a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. GEER. I should think I would, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. GEER. Thank you very much.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. NO questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde?
Mr. VELDE. Do you consider yourself to be a patriotic citizen ?
Mr. GEER. I do indeed, sir. I love America. I love it enough to want to make it better.
Mr. VELDE. In the event of an armed conflict in which the United States would find itself opposed to Soviet Russia, would you be willing to fight on the side of the United States ?
Mr. GEER. Factually, I would grow vegetables for victory for the Farm Bureau as I did before and play hospitals. It would be a wonderful idea, in fact, if they put every man my age in the front lines and in Washington fellows on the other side. I think wars would be negotiated immediately. I approve of that. 190 INDUSTRY 
Mr. VELDE. You say you would be willing to join the Army?
Mr. GEER. Indeed I would, sir, if they could take me.
Mr. VELDE. That's all.
Mr. GEER. My function is growing vegetables and entertaining, however.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Geer, there is one thought running through my mind on your various answers here, and I wish you would explain to me because I just can't get your reasoning. Will you tell this committee as to membership in these various organizations that have been asked you by counsel, and that you have declined to answer on the ground it might incriminate you: How would such an answer in- criminate you?
Mr. GEER. Well, in my opinion it is something set up outside. It is the committee set-up. And you yourself or this committee has made these stipulations. It is something that has been set up and to my mind created artificially.
Mr. KE.ARNY. You mean to say that this committee has set up the fact that if you said that you belonged to any one of these particular organizations asked by the counsel that we would have you in the position where you have incriminated yourself ?
Mr. GEER. I don't quite undertsand that, but so far as this commit- tee is concerned I believe so, sir. That's my feeling today in 1951.
Mr. KEARNEY. In other words, you think that this committee is a persecuting committee?
Mr. GEER. To my mind there's great similarities between the Inquisition and people like in our country that have been persecuted, like Mormons.
Mr. KEARNEY. IS that your's or your counsel's?
Mr. GEER. That's my own opinion.
Mr. KEARNEY. I see counsel advising you on your answers there.
Mr. MARGOLIS (attorney for the witness). I will be glad to give you my opinion, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. You're not testifying.
Mr. MARGOLIS. NO, but I'd be gladMr. GEER. I'd be glad to answer that question.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you believe, Mr. Geer, that the Congress of the United States has the right, to set up a committee such as this is to search out subversive activities in this country ?
Mr. GEER. I'm an entertainer and not a lawyer. I wouldn't know whether it would be right or not.
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, you seem to have enough answers on all other subjects here, questions. Can't you answer that question "Yes" or "No"? 
Mr. GEER. As an entertainer simply and not a lawyer, I really couldn't answer that question, sir. In my opinion, I think it would be more important right now to investigate inflation and the high cost of living. That's my own opinion.
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, I think you've got something there too. 
Mr. GEER. We all of us have to appear in a turkey once in a while. I don't think the public is seriously interested in the factMr. KEARNEY. That's all, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Geer, you say you appeared in a picture called The Tall Target in February or March ?  INDUSTRY 191 
Mr. GEER. February or March of this year, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I should preface this for the record that the introduction of names I shall mention has no particular connotation. Who was the producer of Tall Target?
Mr. GEER. The producer of the picture was I believe Mr. Richard Goldstone.
Mr. JACKSON. Who did the script ? 
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't know about that, sir. I met a man namedon the set-but I couldn't recollect his name.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the director of the picture ?
Mr. GEER. The director of the picture was Anthony Mann.
Mr. JACKSON. And on Lights Out who was the producer ?
Mr. GEER. The producer on that picture was a man named Buckner, a very brilliant producer, and the director was an exceptionally remarkable director named Marc Robeson, who has had several successes.
Mr. JACKSON. Who did the script on Lights Out ?
Mr. GEER. I imagine the producer did. He usually does his.
Mr. JACKSON. On The Barefoot Mailman, who was the producer?
Mr. GEER. The producer on that, Mr. Cohn I think. He's the sonin-law of Harry Cohn. I believe that's the name. Robert Cohn.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know who wrote the script on that ?
Mr. GEER. NO. It was a western laid in Florida. That's about all I recollect about it.
Mr. JACKSON. And the director?
Mr. GEER. The director of that was quite a brilliant young director named Earl McAvoy from Boston.
Mr. JACKSON. What is your agency, Mr. Geer ?
Mr. GEER. My agency is Paul Wilkins, 9006 Sunset Boulevard.
Mr. JACKSON. On the "strip," is it ?
Mr. GEER. Yes. On the "strip," sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I stress again that the names given by the witness in answer to my questions are not necessarily connected with the subject of the committee's investigation. That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. GEER. Thank you very much.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Geer, did I understand you to say in response to counsel's question a while ago concerning the conversations that you had had with the employers that some one of them had told you that he didn't believe all he read about your connection withMr. GEER. Yes. And I added I don't believe all I hear either.
Mr. WooD. Well, in connection with the organizations about which you have been interrogated by counsel, particularly concerning your affiliation or membership with them, don't you think that it would be enlightening to the party, whoever it was in connection with your employment that made that expression that he didn't believe all he read in the paper, to set him completely right about it now by answering the questions frankly here ?
Mr. GEER. I think there is too decided an atmosphere of fear nowadays and hysteria to answer that, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Don't you feel now that your declination to answer questions here leaves you in the position of either giving false testimony or of tacitly admitting your membership therein? 192 INDUSTRY 
Mr. GEER. I don't feel so, sir. 
Mr. WOOD. You don't?
Mr. GEER. No; I don't really.
Mr. WOOD. If you're not a member of such organizations, to say so wouldn't incriminate you, would it?
Mr. GEER. I'd appreciate it so much, Mr. Wood, if you'd ask me questions about the thousands of other benefits I played.
Mr. WooD. I'm asking you about the questions I'm concerned about and that this committee is concerned about.
Mr. GEER. That's whyMr. Woon. And I would very much appreciate a frank answer. I ask you the question: If you are not a member of a single one of these organizations about which you have been interrogated, do you admit that it wouldn't incriminate you to say you are not a member of them ? Don't you admit that?
Mr. GEER. Mr. WoodMr. WOOD. I'd like an answer to that question if I may.
Mr. GEER. I frankly don't know how to answer that question.
Mr. WooD. You don't know how to answer it?
Mr. GEER. I don't know how in this day, 1951.
Mr. WOOD. I will try to make it a little more explicit. You are asked particularly about membership-well, in the Communist Party. Now, if you are not a member of the Communist Party and have never been, do you think it would incriminate you to say so?
Mr. GEER. At this particular time, although the Communist Party is a perfectly legal one, I think they shouldMr. WooD. I'm asking if you're not a member would it incriminate you to say you're not a member ?
Mr. GEER. I'm standing on the Constitution. I believe that they're being persecuted now like the Mormons, the Jews, the Quakers, the MasonsMr. WOOD. That isn't responsive.
Mr. GEER (continuing). Even radical Republicans in Lincoln's day.
Mr. WOOD. That's not responsive to my question.
Mr. GEER. I'm trying to answer directly, sir.
Mr. WooD. I want to know what your conception is about what incriminates you to tell the truth before this committee, if it is the truth, that you are not a member of the Communist Party. That wouldn't in any sense incriminate you, would it?
Mr. GEER. I really believe, sir, that the best answer to that, that I'm just allergic to meetings and things of that sort, and I stand on the advice of my counsel thatMr. WooD. And decline to answer that question ?
Mr. GEER. In this particular day, April 11, 1951, I do, sir, with the situation of the world as it is. It's a hysterical situation.
Mr. WOOD. That's all. SMr. GEER. Thank you, sir.
Mr. VELDE. I have one more question. Did I understand you to say that you felt the Communist Party was a legal party ?
Mr. GEER. I understand so. I believe that.
Mr. VELDE. You understand it is ?
Mr. GEER. To my understanding. COMMUNISM IN 
Mr. VELDE. 193 MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY Would it be any crime to admit your membership in a legal party, then? 
Mr. GEER. In this day of hysteria it is, sir.
Mr. VELDE. That's all.
Mr. GEER. Because they're like-Mr. WooD. Then you want to leave it before this committee then that in your opinion it would subject you to the danger of selfincrimination to either admit it or deny it ?
Mr. GEER. I think so, sir. 
Mr. WooD. Even if your denial was true? If you should deny it and it should be true, that would still incriminate you ? Is that the way you want to leave it ?
Mr. GEER. Well, I'm just simply an entertainer, and I'm not a lawyer, sir, and I can't testify. 
Mr. WooD. Is that all the answer you desire to give the committee?
Mr. GEER. That is sir. We don't get the training in law that you do down in Athens, Ga.
Mr. WooD. You have a couple of very astute counsels. You can confer with them. 
Mr. GEER. I trust lawyers even when they back shows I'm in. I have had some bad experiences in one called Tobacco Road.
Mr. WooD. I didn't ask your opinion about lawyers. I'm just com- menting on the fact you have one on each side of you.
Mr. GEER. I trust the lawyers, sir. 
Mr. WooD. Did the lawyers advise you to say that it would tend to incriminate you to deny your membership in an organization to which you have never belonged ?
Mr. GEER. Well, I take a lawyer's backing if he backed a play, but in this situationMr. WooD. I asked if they advised youMr. GEER. Mr. WoodMr. WOOD. You said you answered on the advice of counsel. I want to know if the counsel have advised you that that is a correct answer and bona fide, straightforwardMr. GEER. I think we're getting out of bounds, Mr. Wood, about the lawyers and things. I'm .just simply an entertainer and like to entertain for the public.
Mr. WOOD. Then do you want to decline to answer that question as to whether or not the attorneys advised you ?
Mr. GEER. I think it would be advisable, sir. I'm sorry.
Mr. WOOD. All right, if you want to leave that cloud on them.
Mr. GEER. Oh, there are lots of clouds, war clouds, all sorts of clouds.
Mr. WOOD. That's all.
Mr. GEER. Thank you, Mr. Wood and committee. (Witness excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Robert Lees. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Lees, do you solemnly swear that the evidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. LEEs. I do.
Mr. WOOD. For the purpose of this investigation, Mr. Reporter, let the record disclose that there is a quorum of the full committee present-Mr. Jackson, Mr. Velde, Mr. Kearney, Mr. Doyle, and Mr. Wood. 194 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY TESTIMONY OF ROBERT LEES, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, ROBERT W.
