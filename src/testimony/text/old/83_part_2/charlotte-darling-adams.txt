Mrs. ADAMs. Well, let's see. In-the flrst job I had in 1033 was in a knitting mill in Los Angeles. Cal-I)et Knitting Mill. That only lasted if weeks. 'hen I was unemployed for a while and I went to work at Ed Fox Productions, all anhIated film studio. This wits during the bank holiday, and I think that was in 1933, wasn't it? I1. 'I'AWFNNti..

Mr. TvRIN NE.. Thienl it. could be said thlat you were employed inl the craft end of the business rather than the creative end?
Mrs. ADA.Ms. I Wa1s IeVer lit ally time Itcrealtivo artist.
Mr. TAyNNPit. Were you acquainted with Mrs. Bernyce Polifka Fleury?
Mr4, ADAMS. Yes, I wits.
Mr. TAVRNNER. Was site employed by the sane company by which you were employed?
Mrs. ADAMts. Not at the same time, no.
Mr. TVRNNEr. How well acquainted were you with Mrs. Fleury?
Mrs. ADAMS. I knew her personally, and her husband. Air. rAV.NNr.it. Are you acquainted with the fact that Mrs. Floury testified before this committee i September of 1951 Airs. ADAs. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNEIr. During the course of her testimony sile identified a person by tile name of Charlotte. 
Mrs. ADAis. Undoubtedly me.
Mr. TANENNir. As aperson who wias known to 1her to have been a member of the Communist Party group of which she wits a member.
Mrs. ADA3S. I had no idea that sile had mentioned my name. You had no idea that she had I
Mr. TAVENNER.
Mrs. ADASus. No, I didn't read 1her testimony. I just heard that she had testified.
Mr. TAvNNF.r. Well, was sile correct In that statements
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, she was.
Mr. TAVENNER. That you were a member of that same group?
Mrs. ADAMS. I was. 
Mr. TAVENNF.R. Now, in tle course of Mrs. Fleury's testimony she described a rather violent disagreement, I should say a positive disagreement, between herself and Mr. Ed Biberman regarding the use of art. Can you enlighten the committee, or do you recall the incident ?
Mrs. ADAms, Yes, I do. It was on an occasion, I think it was an educational, open educational meeting where there were both Communists and non-Communists present, and the discussion had to do with art and whether or not an artist should express himself in any way 11e chose or whether 11e should just reflect social influences, and-=. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THN'iiLO ANOi.,1*4 Aft-i.A 473 well, I Rin not really an artist, and it is a little above my head, but that waiH tie genera idea. T'lire wmas it bsic lifferencO of opinion. I believe that Mr. l3iberman felt that Chiartist had a duty to society to speak for people, ond Ho forth.
Mrs. Fleitry felt that an artist should paint as she wished.
Mr. ''Av1i:NNEI. I|lid Mr. ]il(rn11ai ,ttelided Many tleetings of g!t'Oip. of Conmunists, to your knowledge, when you were present?

Mrs. ADAMS. lie Wits.
Mr. 'I'AVENNXI1. Did you acquire Itfeeling that the Communist Party, through the leadership of Mr. ilibernan, was attempting to influencel)Oele in the practice of their art?
Mrs. AnAAis. Well, yes, and that was itpoint on which there was quite itbit of disagreement, I believe. AM'. 'I'AVwNNEu. And Mr. Ed Biberman wais one of the leaders in the Connunist Party, wits lie not? Was he not so recognized?
Mrs. ADAMs. He w1ts well known.
Mr. TAvNN.Ei. And prominent in fhe work of the Communist Party, within the knowledge of Communist Party members?
Mrs. ADAMs. Yes, I believe so. Alr. TAVENNER. Did you have the feeling that he wits a person who spoke with some authority for the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. Oh, yes. lie had that manner.
Mr. TAVENNFR. And so if a person of that character and reputation and personality of Mr. Biberman advocated a principle, it was a matter that necc. sitrlly hadlweight with other Communist Party members, wouldn't you say?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, to a degree.
Mr. ''AVErNNER. And on this particular occasion he was endeavoring to lead the membership of the Communist Party into the line of carry- ing out some special design in their art? By design I mean some purpose.
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, the art phase of the Communist Party was never that rigid. Actually, the fact that they had, that Mrs. Fleury and
Mr. Biberman had discusson-it was not like a debate, it was simply a discussion, and the two ideas were thrown out for whoever was listening to select.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall the circumstances tinder which Mrs. Fleury left the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. I think it had something to do with her disagreement with Mr. Biberman.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was because of her disagreement with the Communist Party purpose to direct how site should practice her art
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, I think that the party was more in favor of
Mr. Bliberman's approach than it was Mrs. Fleury's.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that resulted in her leaving the Communist PartyI
Mrs. ADAMS. I believe I heard you say the other day that that was her reason.
Mr. TAvENNEr. Well, from your independent recollection.
Mrs. ADAms. She didn't tell me herself. 474 COMMUNIST AVIVITIWS IN T iIN LOB ANU04h AflRA

Mrs. Atn.%ms. I will tel you, Mr. Taveuier, T was i member of the party for quite a long tine, and participated fin an awful lot. of different. roups, due to the flexibility of tile aIrty itself. If you renenber, during this period when 1 belonged there were a great. many changes in policy and a great. many changes in approach, you know, instruction and things like that, and consequently it is pretty hard-I have been sitting down every night trying to remember some of the things. There are periods that are a complete blank, actually.
Mr. TA -. NMR. I do not believe you told us when you first became a member.
Mrs. ADAMS. No, you didn't ask me before.
Mr. TAVENNER. YeV. Well, will you tell us
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, I will. Would you like to know how I became interested in the party? 
Mr. TAVENX1R. Y es; I would like to know that, too. 
Mrs. ADAMS. I think it has to do with how I got the attitude which made me respohid. In about 1935 or 1936 a friend of the studio who had done a little acting in college or something like that, I believe, asked me if I would like to visit the Contemporary Theater, which was, I believe, a leftwing theater in Los Angeles. COMMUNITY ACI'IVII'IS IN Triii L0 ANOMiLiES A.tPA 478 She didn't tell file what kind of theater It was, She list aid Contem!porrlry Thoeiter, will eoliflm worry Rollil(ded--wel, it sRolinled nil right to me, so I wetlt with her.

At that time there was a pnrticllr-I renembti ' (i-/1 1 t8 same period going to some meetings for fiund raising for the 1panish war and I became, I would say, afti-Falscist. ItLwtis su0h it novel situalion to ine that there was no other choice. At that time I was working at Leon Schlesinger Productions and at that time a number of the cartoonists joined a union in the studio not the cartoonists' union, but one of the craft unions, a very small group of craft unions it was, and they asked me if I would be interested injoining that. I said "Yes,' anything to improve conditions in the studio. So I joined, and about the second meeting I went to, the union that we belonged to decided that we were too small a group for them to bother wit, and about that time a number of unorganized different crafts in the studios were organizing independent organizations for the pur. poses of collective bargaining, and- another small group who was in this other union decided they would also organize, and the cartoonists were interested. Well, we were very green in the matter of organization. We knew absolutely nothing about what we had to do.
Mr. TAVE.NER. I don't quite understand when you say "we."
Mrs. ATAMs. We had no experience, we had no understanding of organization, so I asked several members of the union who were the 470 COMMUNIST' AuvrivTI1is IN Ti1i LOS ANWI, IIS AMt(A uly If ma1ylw they euld hel) uniolns orgailhllg t Illolstves Indeleideut , ; tloy would tll glad to. 114 In 011 . orgatllzthmio, and they 1hRI eating And then one of tliu tiasked m1o ff 1 would (e tlerested II Itilt a diseiissio group.
