Mr. LEVY. Melvin Levy.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Levy ?
Mr. LEvY. In Salt Lake City, on May 11, 1902.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you raise your voice just a little bit?
Mr. LEVY. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, briefly, what your educational training has been ? 2310 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. LEVY. I am a graduate with a master's degree of the University of Washington. (Representative Francis E. Walter left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. It is rather difficult to hear you.
Mr. LEVY. I am sorry. I will try to raise it.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated you were a graduate of the University of Washington ?
Mr. LEVY. The University of Washington, and I have a master's degree.
Mr. TAVENNER. A master's degree?
Mr. LEVY. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession?
Mr. LEVY. Writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are a writer?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a writer of screen plays?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, I am a writer of anything.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee briefly what your record of employment or achievement has been in the field of writing?
Mr. LEVY. Well, my first novel was published when I was 21, called Matrix, M-a-t-r-i-x.
Mr. TAVENNER. Matrix?
Mr. LEVY. Matrix. And I published four novels. My first play was Gold Eagle Gyv.
Mr. TAVENNER. We are having difficulty hearing you.
Mr. LEVY. I am terribly sorry. My first play was Gold Eagle Guy. It was done in New York in 1934. And I have done, I suppose, a dozen or 15 or 20 pictures, I don't know; Bandit of Sherwood Forest; Sunday Dinner for a Soldier; Renegades; She's a Soldier, Too.
Mr. TAVENNFR. What were the names of the last two?
Mr. LEVY. The last two that I said. Let's see, did I say "Bandit of Sherwood Forest"?
Mr. TAVENNFR. Bandit of Sherwood Forest?
Mr. LEVY. Yes. Sunday Dinner for a Soldier.
Mr. TAVExNER. Sunday Dinner for a Soldier?
Mr. LEVY. Hitler's Hangman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Hitler's Hangman?
Mr. LEVY. She's a Soldier, Too.
Mr. TAVENNER. She's a Soldier, Too?
Mr. LEVY. That is right. Renegades.
Mr. TAVENNER. Renegades?
Mr. LEVY. Yes. It covers aMr. TAVENNER. That is sufficient.
Mr. Levy, during the course of the hearings conducted by this committee in Los Angeles in September of 1951, Mr. Martin Berkeley appeared as a witness, and identified you as having been at one time a member of the Communist Party. (Addressing news photographers:) May I ask that you get your pictures now?
Mr. LEVY. You can have a lot of them. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2311 
Mr. TAVENNER. Now that is over with.
Mr. LEVY. I am very happy.
Mr. TAVENNER. I stated that Mr. Martin Berkeley had identified you as having been at one time a member of the Communist Party. Did you then voluntarily get in touch with the committee and ask the privilege of appearing before the committee?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. To make such statement or explanation of your membership as you desired?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee did announce in Hollywood, as it has frequently announced, whenever a person has been named as a member of the Communist Party, or any testimony is given relating to him or his organization, that either he or his organization is invited to appear here for such explanation as the individual or the association desires to present. 
Mr. LEVY. That is what I understand.
Mr. TAVENNER. And it is in response to that that you have appeared
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what is it that you desire to state to the committee about it?
Mr. LEVY. Well. Mr. Berkeley's testimony was true. I was twice in my life. I was once a member of the Communist Party, and once a member of the Communist Political Association at various times.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is correct.
Mr. LEVY. I think that it is, at different times, and with no connection between, no connection between the two things. I became a member of the Communist Party in 1933 at the request of Mr. Earl Browder.
Mr. TAvENNER. Where did that take place?
Mr. LEVY. In New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the occasion of Mr. Earl Browder's talking to you ? 
Mr. LEVY. I don't remember precisely how I met Mr. Browder. I do remember that he spoke-asked me if he could come to my house and speak, in an apartment with my wife on Fifteenth Street, and he came there, and brought other people with him, whom I didn't know. And I met him then. And as asked me over some time if I would come in the Communist Party and I said "no," because I said that I was a writer and that as a writer I wanted no obligation to anything except my writing. 
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, I would appreciate it if the gentleman would raise his voice.
Mr. LEVY. I said "no," because I told him that I was a writer and wanted to have no obligation to anything except my writing. I had never, even in college-because I have always thought of myself as a writer, even when I was little. I didn't want to belong to anything. And Mr. Browder then suggested I become a member at large, and that I would not be asked to go t.o meetings, or anything of the sort. And I became a member at large in his office, and was given a name then, and a card. I no longer remember the name. I tried to think of it several times. It could have been Martin, but I am not sure. 2312 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY (Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. LEVY. And then, about some months later, I went-this was at a time when I was engaged in a biography of a man named Tom Mooney, and I met Mr. Mooney on the coast. I had a contract with Harcourt Brace to publish this book.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me interrupt you there. 
Mr. LEVY. Am I saying more than I should?
Mr. TAVENNER. I want you to present it as you desire, but at times I would like to interrupt you.
Mr. LEVY. Please do. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And ask you for more detailed information.
Mr. LEVY. Please do. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I am interested to know why it was that Earl Browder was interested in your membership to the extent that he would suggest that you become a member at large.
Mr. LEVY. Well, I cannot answer that in any accurate way. I imagine that I was not the only person in this situation. I think he regarded me as a good writer, which I like to think of myself as being. That is it.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time that you became a member at the solicitation of Mr. Browder, did you engage in any particular study in company with other members of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir. This was my understanding: That I was not to be required to go to any meetings of any kind; that I was to have conversations with Mr. Browder, as I desired them.
Mr. TAVENNER. What efforts were made to indoctrinate you in the principles of the Communist Party at that time?
Mr. LEVY. I was just trying to think. I talked to him a number of times, and I suppose that would be it. I don't think there wasthere was no intense program. I mean, nothing that I can say "This is it." We had a number of discussions; I suppose four or five or six.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. You may proceed. You were telling us about your work in writing the life story of Tom Mooney.
Mr. LEVY. Tom Mooney. And I went to the coast then, to San Francisco, and had met Mr. Mooney. (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. LevY. I met Mr. Mooney, and he was an extraordinary man. And I very quickly found that the book was being destroyed for my purposes, because there were things going on. The Mooney Molders Committee was fighting with other people, and the book was being molded by decisions that were made that had nothing to do with the book.
Mr. TAVENNER. These decisions that were made that seemed to alter the normal course that such a book should take were being made by whom?
Mr. LEVY. I don't know. They came to me from Mooney. They came to me from Mooney or his sister. But they were having fights with all kinds of people whom I don't know. I was not their confidante.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to find out as to what extent the Communist Party endeavored, if at all, there. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2313 
Mr. LEvY. This I cannot answer. All of my conversations were either with Mooney or with his sister, Miss Mooney. I don't remember her first name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were the changes or the difficulties that you had of such a character that you could determine the source of them; that is, whether they came from problems in the Communist ideology?
Mr. LEVY. I would guess that they came from many sources. I would guess that the AFL would say something; that the molders committee would say something, probably the Communist Party would say something. There were many people interested in Mooney in a different way than I was interested in him. I remember one of the things-it is a long time ago, and it is hard for me to remember details-one of the things that went back and forth was the attitude about the American Federation of Labor, it sometimes was for and sometimes it was against, and this man was just lost sight of.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did your Communist Party membership have anything to do with your selection as a person to write the life of Tom Mooney ?
Mr. LEvy. No. This preceded it. No, this was Harcourt Brace and I that had this idea. It began with another firm whose name I do longer reniember, which was later absorbed by Harcourt Brace who thought this was a good idea.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand this work commenced before you became a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. Yes; the contract was made before the negotiations, but just before I went to San Francisco to meet Mr. Mooney, I had these meetings with Mr. Browder. Counsel, may I ask a question?
Mr. KEARNEY. IMr.
Mr. TAVENNER. Certainly.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman?
Mr. MOULDER (presiding). Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. At the time you talked with Mr. Earl Browder concerning your joining the Communist Party, was Browder the leader of the Communist Party in America at that time?
Mr. LEvY. I don't know if he was a leader. He was a very important man. I don't know if he was at the top. He was an important man. I think he had a special interest in writers and artists.
Mr. KEARNEY. He had a special interest in obtaining recruits for the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. I think lie also had an interest in writers and artists and painters. 
Mr. KEARNEY. For the Communist Party, and for recruitment into the party ?
Mr. LEVY. Yes; but I think-this is judgment, personally-that he was a widely read man, and a very literate man.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the reason he had? That is the question I was trying to get at a moment ago. What was the reason that Earl Browder had for taking this special interest in writers? Do you think it was to influence the course of their writings?
Mr. LEVY. Yes; I think it was two things. I think that certainly it was to influence the course of writings, but I think also that this particular thing came out of his own personality-this is a matter of 2314 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY judgment-he was a man who I remember had read more poets than I had read, and that was at a time when I was reading a great many poets. He was a man who read a great deal. I think both things existed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he discuss with you at any time your assignment to write the story of Tom Mooney?
Mr. LEVY. Yes. I told him what I wanted to do.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that before he asked you to become a member of the Communist Party ? Did he knowMr. LEVY. I understand your question. I don't know the sequence of events. It was all about the same time. (Representative Bernard W. Kearney left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. LEVY. It all happened about the same time. and I cannot say what preceded what each time. He might very well have known.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you at any time during the course of your work in connection with that assignment feel that you were being influenced in any way by members of the Communist Party in the performance of your task that was being attempted?
Mr. LEVY. As I say, from the time I got to San Francisco until the job was finished all of my contacts were either with Mr. Mooney or his sister. But it was obvious that these contacts were reflecting a great many-I think you have to understand what kind of a man Mooney was. This is a man, who was, I think, as interesting as any man I have ever known. He had a particular quality. But he had a tremendous egotism, and he thought of himself in all the meetings I had with him, he spoke of himself in the third person. And he thought of himself as a nation thinks of itself, or as the Congress thinks of itself. He never thought of himself as a man named Tom Mooney. He would never say, "I think"; he would say, "Tom Mooney thinks." I never heard him use the first person singular pronoun. Now, these were things that I wanted to have in the book. There were a great many things. To me he was a character, and a great character.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Mr. Mooney at any time make a statement to you regarding either his membership or nonthembership in the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. No; but he said to me a number of times, "Tom Mooney and the Soviet Union," as if they both occupied the same size of territory. So I would doubt thatMr. JACKSON. The sequence would seem to indicate that he perhaps occupied more space than the Soviet Union.
Mr. LEVY. That was always a sequence, an accidentalMr. DOYLE. May I ask a question right there: At the time he used that phrase, "Tom Mooney and the Soviet Union," did he use it in such a way that it indicated to you that there was cooperation or functioning together by Tom Mooney and the Soviet Union?
Mr. LEVY. I would think not. I would think that it indicated that there might be a temporary alliance at one point or another, but at no time a breaking down of the borders, bo to speak. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2315 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you publish your book ?
Mr. LEVY. No. The book was a fiasco. Harcourt didn't want to publish it, and I didn't want to publish it, either. The book was just a hodgepodge. Then I went to Browder and said that this was why I did not want to have anything, any organizational contacts, and asked to be released, and returned my card he had given me, I believe, and was released at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain in the Communist Party at that period?
Mr. LEVY. Well, it must have been right around a year, shading one way or the other, right around a year.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the year? I do not know that you have fixed the exact year.
Mr. LEVY. Well, it was through most of the year 1933. One of the reasons I felt most strongly about this in terms of my experience was that I was them embarking on a series of what were going to be five novels on the Pacific coast from which I come, and I was going to treat the Pacific coast in terms of industry and industrialists.
Mr. JACKSON. Could you speak a little louder, please ?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, I can. I say I was going to write; I had the project of writing what was going to be a series of five novels on the Pacific coast, which is my home, in terms of industries, and the protagonists in each case were to be industrialists. And I felt that this was a field in which there could be all kinds of interference, the kind I didn't want. I took two of these. The first of these was the The Last Pioneers, which was a novel. The second was Gold Eagle Guy, which was done as a play. And I don't know if this is apropos, or not, but both of these were reviewed adversely in the left-wing press, generally on the basis that I had romanticized industrialists, although, I may say, that in at least one case, one who thought he was the protagonist, or his family, was just as adverse.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did I understand you to say that you did not want to feel any restraints at the time that you prepared these, or wrote these two novels?
Mr. LEVY. I didn't want to feel any restraint about writing at all, but particularly because I knew I was going to deal with industry and industrialists.
Mr. TAVENNER. What reason did you have to believe that you would have any restraint placed upon you?
Mr. LEVY. I had just been through it with the Mooneys.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did that have anything to do with your leaving the party at that particular time?
Mr. LEVY. It had everything to do with it; yes, sir. That is it.
Mr. TAVENNER. So it was because of the restraint that sou felt would be imposed by the Communist Party that you withdrew?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. I didn't want restraint from anybody. I didn't want restraint from anybody.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you were of the opinion that that would interfere with your own creative work in the writing of the novels The Last Pioneer and so on?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. 2316 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. DOYLE. I think, counsel, when Mr. Levy testified before he did not use the word "restraint." He said "no obligation." I am wondering if there is any difference in his mind between the terms. You used the term "obligation"; you did not use the term "restraint," did you not?
Mr. LEVY. I don't remember, but let me say this: That I have been writing most of my life, and only once has anybody said to me, "this is what you are to write, and this is the way you are to write it." Nobody in my life has ever said to me excepting once "this is the way the thing has got to be done." And I don't remember using the word "obligation," but I think obligation is the closer word.
Mr. DOYLE. I think the exact language was-and I wrote it down because I thought it was significant-"I wanted to have no obligation except to my writing."
Mr. LEVY. I wasn't conscious of using that word, but that is the more accurate thing. That is what I meant.
Mr. TAVENNER. What I am trying to understand is whether or not you felt that membership in the Communist Party would hinder you in carrying out your work in the preparation of the novels you spoke of.
Mr. LEvY. I felt, and do feel, that membership in any organization that has a program to which you bind yourself by being a member must give you an obligation-and thank you for giving me back that word-must give you an obligation to those things which must influence your writing. For instance, in Gold Eagle Guy, the protagonist is a shipping man, a San Francisco man, who is a shipper who creates a shipping empire. Now, as I say, the family of the man who thought that I was writing about him was very indignant that I had treated him this way, but to me he was a character. I didn't want to say, because the family may object to it, I didn't want to paint him one way, but also to me lie was a very romantic and powerful, creative character, and I didn't want to be under-this was his significance to me, was that he was both things, was that lie was creative, that lie built, that he was essential, and also on the other side that he was animmnoral, that he was ruthless, and you must have both these things to make a character, to make a man. And if you leave out either thing you are lying.
Mr. TAVENNEn. You stated that there was only one occasion when you were told, or directed what to write. Has that any bearing upon the matters which this committee is investigating?
Mr. LEvy. I was working for the New York Journal.
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of the problem which you mentioned, you withdrew from the Communist Party in 1933?
Mr. LEVY. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. During the year's period when you were a member at that time, did you pay dues?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir; I think I paid Mr. Browder something when he gave me the card, some small sum, but no others.
Mr. TAVENN .R. But as a member at large, you did not pay dues?
Mr. LEVY. No. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2317 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your next affiliation or connection with the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. This was either in late 1944 or early in 1945 with the Communist Political Association, and I stress the name because this was the connection.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you desire to say to the committee regarding your experience at that time?
Mr. LEVY. Well, I was asked to join, and said what had happened there before, said what had happened; said much of what I have said to you here now. And then was told that the Communist Party no longer existed; that the Communist Political Association existed, and that it was an entirely different kind of thing; that it was part of the unity between wartime allies, et cetera, et cetera, and I joined.
Mr. TAVENNER. And because of those representations your attitude toward your work and your party was different from what it had been back in 1933?
Mr. LEVY. Well, the party no longer-there was no more party. You see, this was the thing: That there was no more party. There was no more Communist Party at this time. And that the situation that I had found unpleasant did not exist and could not exist, and that we were wartime allies with them, and we were-I cannot finish that sentence.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was instrumental in bringing you into the party ?
Mr. LEVY. A man named Willner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that George Willner ?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether he is the same George Will- ner who was an agent for various writers andMr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. And who appeared before this committee and refused to testify on the ground that to do so might incriminate him?
Mr. LEVY. I didn't know that he had appeared before the committee, but he was an agent, lie was my agent, or he worked for my agent. He was an employee of my agent.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just tell us a little more in detail of what Mr. Willner did to bring you into the party again in 1944.
Mr. LEVY. It was either late 1944 or 1945-I am not sure which.
Mr. TAVENNER. The Communist Political Association had its inception in 1944?
Mr. LEVY. Well, I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. And ended in 1945?
Mr. LEVY. I am not sure in my own mind, whether it was 1944 or 1945. That is why I-and I don't know how to establish it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just recite the events or the circumstances under which George Willner approached you.
Mr. LEVY. He spoke to me about this a number of times saying more or less what I have said now, in different ways, and finally I said, or finally he said, "I would like you to go to a meeting," and I said, "0. K."
Mr. JACKSON. A little louder, please.
Mr. LEVY. I am terribly sorry. 2318 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY And he gave me an address, and I went to the meeting. He was not there. (Representative Bernard W. Kearney reentered the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. How is that ?
Mr. LEVY. He was not there. And the assumption was thatthere was nothing more formal than that. I went to this meeting, and then I went to some others, not a lot.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were these meetings held?
Mr. LEVY. It was in the valley; I don't know. You say whose house? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. LEVY. I am not-I don't know. It was in the valley. It was on the flat part of the valley. There was a house I never went to again, and Bill I asked me that, and I have tried to remember that, and I have tried to remember since, and I just don't know whose house it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many meetings did you attend ? 
Mr. LEVY. Six or eight over a period of time; maybe five.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over what period of time ?
Mr. LEVY. Over a period of several months. There were a half dozen, I should think. (A note was handed to the witness.) This note just says "Louder."
Mr. TAVENNER. I think you should read it because I would not want it to appear that we were handing you private notes.
Mr. LEVY. No. You looked so distressed. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The note says "Louder"?
Mr. LEVY. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, try to speak a little louder.
Mr. LEVY. Over a period of several months, I think there were five or six or eight.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were these meetings held? If you attended about five meetings, can you tell us, or give us the names of the homes of any of the persons? 
Mr. LEVY. A man named Bill Blowitz.
Mr. TAVENNER. Bill, is that Blowitz, B-1-o-w-i-t-z?
Mr. LEVY. Yes; it is apparently the same man, if that is the way you pronounce it.
Mr. TAVENNFr. Do you recall his first name? 
Mr. LEVY. Bill.
Mr. TAVENNER. And in what business was he engaged?
Mr. LEVY. He is a publicity man. (At this point, counsel for the committee interrupted the proceedings to discuss another matter.)
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated that you attended a meeting in the home of William Blowitz.
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give us the names of other persons in whose homes you met ? 
Mr. LEVY. I am trying to do that now. At a later time, Lester ColeI think not at this time; I'm not sure-it's hard to remember them, COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2319 because they were often in the homes of people I didn't know, and because it was so irregular, they were usually with people whom I didn't know. I think you have something in front of you thereMr. TAVENNER. Do you recall meeting at the home of Mortimer Offner?
Mr. LEVY. I believe so. (Representative Bernard W. Kearney left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. LEVY. I think there was one of these that was at my house.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us the names of any other members of this group ? 1
Mr. LEVY. No; Bill has the names there. Mr. Berkeley was one; Betty Wilson, who also testified that I met her at such a meeting, has testified accurately.
Mr. TAVENNER. And she testified in the Hollywood hearings?
Mr. LEVY. Yes; and this was accurate.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall a person by the name of Edward Huebsch, H-u-e-b-s-c-h?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party, to your knowledge?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. On what do you base your statement ?
Mr. LEVY. Because he asked me if I would like-when I had left, if I would likeMr. TAVENNER. Speak a little louder.
Mr. LEVY. When I had left, he asked me if I wanted to be in or out. (Representative Bernard W. Kearney returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with a person by the name of Alfred Levitt, L-e-v-i-t-t?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he known to you to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. LEVY. This is something that I have been trying to remember. I have said-when I read this, I found his name there, and I cannot now say-I would say "Yes," but I cannot-I would say he is, but I keep trying to find a reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't want you to say so unless you know it of your own knowledge.
Mr. LEVY. I am trying to find the reason in my mind that I would say "Yes."
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, if you have any reason, state it.
Mr. LEVY. Well, I have been trying to think if I ever was at that meeting with him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me say this, that before you express any opinion you should first conclude in your own mind whether you know he was a member of the party.
Mr. LEvY. That is a difficult thing. I read it there, and when I said it 1 must have had a reason for saying it.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean, you read it there ? I Bill refers to William A. Wheeler, committee investigator 95829-52-pt. 7-2 2320 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. LEVY. When I read over the testimony I gave Bill, what I gave Bill earlier. And then, afterward, when I saw it there, I began to try to remember why I said it. I cannot remember now whether I was at a meeting with him or not. I was with him at a number of Screen Actors' Guild meetings and that kind of thing. And I would say that I am pretty sure the answer is "Yes," but I cannot say right now why I say "Yes." And I would like to, because this has bothered me.
Mr. T \WENNER. Well, is that all you have to say with regard to
Mr. Levitt?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, for your information, as you were not at the Hollywood hearings, Mr. Levitt was identified by witnesses there as a member of the Communist Party. Now, were you affiliated with the Communist Party in any way between the years 1936 and 1944?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir. (Representative Clyde Doyle returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend any meetings of the Communist Party during that time?
Mr. LEv Y. No. sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Or Marxist study groups during that period of time ?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir. No, I was living on a farm in Bucks County.
Mr. TAVENNER. In Pennsylvania?
Mr. LEVY. Yes. And I don't remember attending any public things except auction sales. But during that time, I certainly had no connection with anything.
Mr. TAVErNNER. When did you go to California ?
Mr. LEVY. 1941, sir.
Mr. T.xkvNNrn. Well, you were in California in 1933?
Mr. Livy. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNZR. When you were working on the Tom Mooney book?
Mr. LrvY Yes. I was in San Francisco then. Then when Gold Eagle Guy was running, I was out to do one picture for Metro.
Mr. TAVFNNER. When was that?
Mr. LEVY. That was 1935.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you in California between 1936 and 1941?
Mr. LEVY. Yes. I had a job for Universal. I was out there for 6 weeks, in 1939. But I did not have any connection with anything. (Representative Francis E. Walter returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNE.R. Were you out there between 1936 and 1939, that is, out in California?
Mr. LrvY. No. I was there for the first time in 1933. Then I was there in 1935 at Metro. And in 1939. at Universal. Then I came out again just before Pearl Harbor in 1941, shortly before Pearl Harbor. And that time I brought my family, and I have stayed.
Mr. MOULDER. In 1944, were you issued a membership card, or was your affiliation just by attendance at meetings which you recognized or assumed to be Communist meetings?
Mr. LEV'. Which I recognized. So far as I know, the only card I ever remember was the one Mr. Browder gave me in 1933. There may have been cards made out that were not issued to me, but I do not remember seeing them. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2321 
Mr. MOULDER. Then could we assume you were a member of the Communist Party in 1941 other than attending meetings, or what was your attitude about that ?
Mr. LEVY. Well, I regarded myself so. Of the political association, rather.
Mr. DOYLE. I think you said there was no more party.
Mr. LEVY. That is right. It was the political association.
Mr. Do-LE. It was your understanding that it did not exist?
Mr. LEVY. I think that was true. I think the party did not exist then, or did not exist in any form thatMr. MOULDER. That was the point that I referred to.
Mr. LEVY. I think Mr. Tavenner used the words interchangeably.
Mr. VELDE. Well, in your own mind, was not the Communist Political Association the same as the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir.
Mr. VELDE. What, in your mind, was the difference between the two? Was there any difference in the personnel or the membership?
Mr. LEVY. This I don't know, because I don't know what the membership was. There was certainly a difference, because I was a difference.
Mr. VELDE. You mean there was a difference in your own mind? 
Mr. LEVY. Yes, I was a difference. ship. It was a difference in member- 
Mr. VELDE. You had belonged to the Communist Party prior to 1944 ? 
Mr. LEVY. But I left for the specific reasons I stated, and would not have gone back, for those reasons.
Mr. VELDE. I am a little confused about this. I am sorry, Mr. Counsel. I understood you were a member of the Communist Party prior to its change to the Communist Political Association.
Mr. LEvY. This was in 1933.
Mr. TAvi:NNI:R. In 1933 lie dropped out of the Communist Party. (Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. VELDE. And yon did not rejoin it againMr. L:vY. Until 1944. 
Mr. VrLinr. When you joined the Communist Political Association?
Mr. LEVY. Yes.
Mr. VELrD. I see.
Mr. TA\vExN-rn. How long were you a member of the Communist Political Association?
Mr. LEaY. Well, actually, technically, I suppose, I was a member until 1947, I think, some time in 1947. I had stopped going to meetings a long time before that. But I think technically it was in 1947.
Mr. TAVENNEn. Actually, the Communist Political Association went out of existence in 1945.
Mr. Lrvy. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Therefore, you just remained in the Communist organization, which had converted in 1945 back to its former title, that of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. What happened was that finally-I wasn't being around, and finally I was called on to say, "What do you want to do ?" Finally
Mr. Hnebsch called and said, "What do you want to do?"
Mr. TAVENNER. Who called ? 2322 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. LEVY. Mr. Huebsch.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the name, please ?
Mr. LEVY. You spelled it a minute ago.
Mr. TAVENNER. I know.
Mr. LEVY. H-u-e-b-s-c-h.
Mr. MOULDER. During all that time you referred to, as being associated with the Communist Party or the Political Association of the Communist Party, would you say it influenced your writings, books, or any other publications or works that you have done?
Mr. LEvy. No, sir; it did not.
Mr. MOULDER. Then the association you had with the Communist Party organization, or with the Communist Party members, did not influence in any way your publications or the work that you were doing; that is, the philosophy or the belief of those people or the party organization ?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. Your answer is "No"?
Mr. LEVY. My answer is "No." And I am smiling because one meeting that I remember clearly, the content of it was on literature.
Mr. TAVENNER. Speak a little louder.
Mr. LEVY. The one meeting I remember clearly, and I don't know why I remember it, was on the question of literature. It was on the question of realism and naturalism. The announced subject was Marxist Criticism. And I think of myself as knowing something about these subjects, and I was told by a girl whom I had never seen before or since that I had no right to know about these subjects, because she, who represented the working class, understood them instinctively, and she disagreed with me, and therefore I must be in error.
Mr. MOULDER. Was there ever any attempt on the part of any of the members of the Communist Party or the organizations you mentioned in your testimony to influence you or to persuade you to write in such manner as would include the Communist philosophy or belief?
Mr. LEVY. Nothing that is overt, excepting in a kind of an almost automatic sense, that you are influenced by the people that you are with. If I spent time with you, I would be influenced by you, and you would be influenced by me, I mean, that kind of thing. But there is only one time in my life that somebody has said, "This is what you have to write."
Mr. MOULDER. Then was it your purpose, in joining the party in 1933, as well as associating yourself with the meetings that you have mentioned in 1944, to inform yourself or to broaden your information concerning the workings and the functions of the Communist Party organizations in this country? Was it curiosity, or what?
Mr. LEVY. I am trying to find a way of saying this so that it doesn't sound kind of silly. But my purpose both times was in the hope that I would find a way of leaving my kids a better world than I lived in. And when I found that I was not doing that, then I didn't want to do it any more. I have lots of kids.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was this person who stated to you that you should not think as you were thinking?
Mr. LEVY. As I say, it was a girl I never saw before or since.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was this in one of the Communist Party meetings? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2323 
Mr. LEVY. Oh, yes, I can't remember anything about it excepting this, that I felt such a fury. I find the kind of an automobile mechanic or somebody might feelMr. TAVENNER. During this part of your experience in the Communist Party, was Communist Party literature made available to you for study?
Mr. LEVY. Yes. There was always literature, but a great variety of literature. There was both Communist literature and general literature available.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you expected to study and master the Communist Party literature?
Mr. LEVY. No. You could either buy it or not buy it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were discussion groups held on Communist matters, matters involving Communist ideology.
Mr. LEVY. I never attended one.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many meetings in all did you attend ? I believe you have stated about five.
Mr. LEVY. I would say not less than five nor more than eight.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under which you left the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. I just left. I just wasn't there. And then after a long period of time Mr. Huebsch came to see me and said, "What do you want to do? Do you want to be in or out?" And I say, "Out." In my own mind, I had been gone a long time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you pay Communist Party dues during this period?
Mr. LEVY. I paid some dues in meetings. They were small dues.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall to whom you paid them ?
Mr. LEVY. No, I think somebody would get up and say, "Give me your quarter," or something of that kind. I don't think it was more than a quarter. It may have been as much as 50 cents.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you contribute to any functions of the Communist Party by making special contributions, or such things as bene- fits for the New Masses?
Mr. LEVY. I bought a picture once at a New Masses sale, a very good picture. This was before I had any connection withMr. TAVENNER. Did you at any time attend a fraction meeting of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. Not at any time, knowing that I was so doing.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were a member, I believe, of the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization, were you not?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. I have some place a note from Mr. Roosevelt thanking me for that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you engaged in any of the activities of that group after the termination of the war?
Mr. LEVY. I didn't know that it existed after the war. I was later told it had. But I was told it went out of existence during the war.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know anything of the purpose that the or- ganization had in perpetuating itself after the period of the war?
Mr. LEVY. I didn't know it did. As I say, I was told quite recently that it had. But as far as I knew, it was a wartime thing, for civilian defense. (Representative James B. Frazier, Jr., left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with John Howard Lawson? 2324 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir; very well.
Mr. TAVENNER. John Howard Lawson, by the testimony adduced at numerous hearings before the committee, has been shown to be the head of the Communist Party in Hollywood.
Mr. LEVY. I didn't know him as such. I met John Howard Lawson in 1925, when my first novel was published. We had the same publisher. And this was the way I knew himMr. TAVENNER. Were you going to say something else? 
Mr. LEVY. No, I was just hesitating as to whether it was worth while to tell the circumstances of my meeting with him. I don't think it is. They are amusing, but they are not pertinent. (Representative Francis E. Walter left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you active in the work of the committee for the Writers' Congress, which was held in the campus at Los Angeles October 1, 2, and 3, 1943?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir, and so were a great many people from the Army, from the State Department, from the university.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was shown by hearings before the committee that that work was done as a result of being influenced by the Communist Party. Do you know anything about that? (Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. LEVY. No, sir. I was introduced to it and asked to participate in it by Phil Dunn of the OWI, who is certainly not by the farthest stretch of the imagination a Communist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall signing a petition dated October 18, 1948, for the nomination of Lester Cole and Ring Lardner, Jr., as members of the executive board of the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. LrvY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. 1948 is a period of time later than that when you said you withdrew from the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. That had nothing to do with that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you in favor in 1948 of electing to the executive board of the guild persons who were known to you to be members of the Communist Party ? 
Mr. LEVY. I can only tell you that either in that year or the year before I also signed a nominating petition for a man named Fred Niblo, Jr., who is as far to the right as you can get. 
Mr. TAVENNER. But was Lester Cole known to you to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNrER. And was Ring Lardner, Jr., known to you to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEVY. No, sir; not known.
Mr. TAVENNrR. But Lester Cole was?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. But I signed these two petitions, the Niblo petition and this petition, on the basis that a man who had anything to say to the guild ought to have a chance to say it.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am not speaking of the opportunity to say what he wanted to say, what one wants to say, before the guild. This is a matter of the election of the members of the executive board.
Mr. LEVY. No, sir; this is a matter of nomination, putting a name on the ballot and letting the members decide. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2325 (Representative Francis E. Walter returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. You don't mean to say you would sign a person's petition for nomination and then vote against him?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNEIR. Was that your view in this instance? Is that what you expected to do?
Mr. LEVY. In this case I would have voted for one of the men and against the other one. In the case of Mr. Niblo, I would, and told him I would, vote against him.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am speaking about Lester Cole, the person known to you to be a member of the party.
Mr. LEVY. I say of these two people I would have voted for one and against the other. I don't remember how I did vote.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you intend in signing the petition to support Lester Cole, who was a person then known to you to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. LEVY. Lester is the person I would not have voted for and did not vote for.
Mr. TAVENNER. Although you did sign his nominating petition?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. I would and assume I did vote for Ring Lardner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any statement that you desire to make to the committee with regard to the character of your break with the Communist Party, that is, whether it was full and complete?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir. I assume that I have made that statement, that it was full and complete, I mean, that this is the content of my appearance here; that it is full and complete, that I have not heard anything nor have any desire or reason to hear anything, since this last time, about 4 years ago. I don't think there would beMr. TAVENNER. Tlat is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Levy, do you have legal counsel with you?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you want to identify him?
Mr. LEVY. Mr. Gang, sir. [Martin Gang.]
Mr. DOYLE. I was interested in your comment that back in 1943, as I thought you said, you thought you paid Earl Browder some dues.
Mr. LEVY. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Did he ask you for dues for the Communist Party, or how did you happen to pay him?
Mr. Li:vY. Well, as I remember, he gave me this card, and I don't remember the words, but the sense of it was, "I want a quarter," or it may have been a dime. The sums were very, very small. I mean, it just seemed to me the way things were done.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Kearney? Mr. Potter? Is there any reason why the witness should not be excused?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, there is one question I may desire to ask the witness, if you will bear with me a moment, please. There was a witness who appeared in Los Angeles in response to a subpena by the name of Carl Foreman. Were you acquainted with him?
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party? 2326 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. LEVY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. On what do you base your statement?
Mr. LEVy. Because I was invited to hear him talk to a meeting, which I have every presumption was a Communist meeting, to talk about his work.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was the meeting held, as nearly as you can recall?
Mr. LEVY. Possibly '46. It was at a time when I had not been around for a long while, and I went to this because I was very interested in hearing him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is he the same person who appeared in the hearings at Hollywood and refused to answer questions on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate him?
Mr. LEVY. I assume so. I don't know. I didn't hear that testimony.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was Carl Foreman employed at that time, the one that you were speaking of?
Mr. LEvy. He was a writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time he appeared?
Mr. LEVY. You mean who was he working for?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. LEv. I don't know. He is not a man that I have known well.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LEVY. Mr. Chairman, before concluding my testimony I should like to repeat part of the testimony I gave to Mr. Wheeler on October 22, 1951.
Mr. WALTER. Very well.
Mr. LEVY. My name was mentioned at the recent hearings of the Committee on Un-American Activities in Los Angeles as having formerly been a member of the Communist Party in the United States. I also heard statements made by the chairman of the committee to the effect that any person named as having been a member of the Communist Party would have the opportunity to testify before this committee as to whether the statement was true or untrue, and if true that any statements with reference to disaffiliation with the party might be given to the committee under oath. I am taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the committee since the statement made with reference to my past affiliation with the Communist Party was a true and correct statement. I have for a considerable period of time, however, not been a member of the Communist Party. I left because I did not believe in the aims, purposes, or operation of the party. I found it had nothing to offer me and had no place in this country. I did not offer to testify before the committee since I frankly felt that I had had such a minor connection with the party that I would serve no useful purpose in volunteering. Nevertheless, my name has been mentioned and I am grateful to the committee for granting me this opportunity to get the record straight.
Mr. WALTER. Thank you. The witness may be excused.
Mr. LEVY. Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. WALTER. The committee will stand in recess until 2 o'clock this afternoon. (Whereupon, at 11: 55 a. m., the committee recessed to reconvene at 2 p. m. of the same day.) COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2327 (The following statement was inserted at this point by Representative Morgan M. Moulder:) It is my opinion that the committee should commend and express appreciation to all witnesses who cooperate and truthfully testify and reveal all of their knowledge and information of communistic activities in our country. Therefore, I want to record to show that witness Melvin Levy voluntarily appeared and has so cooperated and testified in his assistance of tins committee of its work of exposing communistic activities in this country. AFTERNOON SESSION (The hearing reconvened at 2:15 p. m., Representatives Morgan Moulder, James B. Frazier, Jr., Harold H. Velde, Bernard W. Kearney, and Donald L. Jackson, being present, Mr. Walter, presiding.)
Mr. WALTER. The committee will come to order. Who is your first witness, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Michael Blankfort.
Mr. WALTER. Will you raise your right hand, please? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. BLANKFORT. Yes, sir.
Mr. WALTER. Proceed, please. TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL SEYMOUR BLANKFORT
