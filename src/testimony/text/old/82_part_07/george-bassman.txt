Mr. B \ISMAsA.George Bassman.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born ?
Mr. B kSSMAN. New York City, February 7,1914.
Mr. TAVLNNLS. Will you give the committee a statement of your general educational background?
Mr. B.xAsMAN. Well, I was brought up in Boston, and I went to Memorial High School there. I stayed in Boston until 1932 or 1933, and then I went to New York where I lived until 1936, and from there I left for Hollywood where I worked until 1948, and then returned to New York. 2366 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession?
Mr. BASSMAN. I am a musician, composer, and arranger.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Bassman, in the course of the hearings in Hollywood in September you were identified as a member of the Communist Party by Mr. Martin Berkeley. I understand that very soon thereafter you indicated a desire to appear before the committee and be heard in regard to the matter.
Mr. BASSMAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. IVell, sir, you are at liberty to make any explanation to the committee you desire to make.
Mr. BASSMAN. Well, I believe in 1938 I was invited to a few meetings, which I attended, which I discovered were of Communist nature. I probably attended six or seven meetings, in all, over a period of 3 or 4 months.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment, please. You said these meetings were, you discovered, of a Communist nature?
Mr. BASSMAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you mean that they were meetings of the Communist Party?
Mr. BASs.iMAN. I didn't know it at the time I went, but I subsequently found out that they were.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you find that out?
Mr. BASSMAN. Oh, after I went to maybe three of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you continued to attend the meetings ?
Mr. BASSMAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. I interrupted you. You may proceed.
Mr. BASSMAN. Well, I went for a short time longer. I found that I had no interest in anything that went on there and just ceased going.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many Communist Party meetings did you attend?
Mr. BASSMAN. Well, there couldn't have been over a half dozen, perhaps seven.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were the meetings held?
Mr. BAssMasN. Well, there were a couple of them that were held at my home, there were a few that were held at the home of Mr. Berkeley, and I don't recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend a Communist Party meeting at the home of Mr. Ornitz, Sam Ornitz?
Mr. BASSMAN. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. On Martell Street in Hollywood ?
Mr. BASSMAN. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say possibly several meetings were held in your home?
Mr. BASSMAN. Yes; probably two or three.
Mr. TAVFNNEi. Probably two or three?
Mr. BAssM \N. Yes, sir.
Mr. TA.VENNER. Did you invite those who attended to come?
Mr. BASSM.AN. I never invited anybody.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, how did it happen that these meetings were held in your home?
Mr. BASSMAN. They were invited by my ex-wife, who had invited me. COMMUNIsM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2367 
Mr. TAVENNER. You mean you only came to your home when you had Communist Party meetings?
Mr. BA.ssM.%AN. No, no, no, I was invited originally by my ex-wife, who had gone to some meetings before I ever went. Because she felt, and when we talked it over we both felt that we both should be interested in the same things, I went with her to one of these meetings, and then I went to the second, and then the third might have been at my home, and that is how I attended a meeting in my own home.
Mr. T.AVENNER. Actually, at the end of a meeting, say, in your home, was it not agreed by all present as to where the meeting should be held the next week, or in the next 2 weeks?
Mr. BASSMAN. Undoubtedly, but I really don't recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Don't you think you were present and took part in meetings at which it was determined that the next meeting would be at your home ?
Mr. BAs%.MAx. Yes, sir; but I don't recall-there is so little that I recall about these meetings now, because it is so many years later, I don't really remember now. I remember going, but I don't remember much of what happened. I remember a few things, but not much.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, your position is that you were not active in the work of the Communist Party ?
Mr. BAssM.AN. Not at all.
Mr. TA ENNER. But you were a member of the Communist Party, do you mean that?
Mr. BASSMAN. So I have been told. I never joined to my recollection, but I cannot say that I wasn't a member, because I might have been. I don't recall ever paying dues. I know that I never took money out of my pocket and gave it to anyone, according to my best recollection; but I have been told that I was in the party for a short period of time, and I cannot deny it.
Mr. TAvENNER. Did you take any action to stop the Communist Party from meeting in your home?
Mr. BAsA.MAN When I stopped going to the meetings, I asked my wife if -hliewould mind never having a meeting there, and we never did again.
Mr. T\\ INXr:N. What was vour reason for not attending other meeting,?
Mr. BAs . AX. Well, I didn't understand too much of what went on. I have never been a political person. I am a musician. The kind of work that I do in my music sometimes will keep me working for 3 weeks straight with maybe 2 or 3 hours sleep a night. I tried to study a Marx pamphlet and couldn't make heads or tails out of it; and this was why I stopped going.
Mr. TATI'NNER. Well, did high functionaries of the Communist Party appear at your meetings and endeavor to instruct you on the subject of Marxism and communism ?
Mr. BAssMAN. No, sir; I recall in 1937 attending a class where I was supposed to be studying a Marx pamphlet, ad I went to two or three of those classes and stopped going to those, because I didn't understand them.
Mr. TAVEXNER. Who were conducting those classes?
Mr. B.AssMrAN. As I recall, there was a man by the name of Jacobson, but I don't know his first name. 95829-52-pt. 7-0 2368 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. Eli Jacobson?
Mr. BASSMAN. I think that is his name; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there any others?
Mr. BASSMAN. I beg your pardon?
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there any other instructors?
Mr. BASSMAN. Not that I recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, is it your statement that you left the Communist Party because you could not understand the Marx theory? Is that your reason for leaving?
Mr. BASSMAN. I hate to appear stupid, because I don't really feel that I am. But on political matters, I just really had no interest. I was interested in music, in playing tennis, in, well, in things that were not political.
Mr. T \VENNER. How was it that you happened to get into the Communist Party if you had no interest in matters of that kind?
Mr. BAsSMAN. Well, occasionally, one follows someone that is close into some sort of a project that interests them, and that is what happened to me here. I recall someone very close to me in-may I deviate for a moment?
Mr. TAVENNFR. Yes.
Mr. BASSMAN. I recall someone very close to me interested in psychoanalysis once who was in it for 21/2 years, and they insisted that I would have to be analyzed, because they were interested in it. Well, it was the same sort of thing.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is a very interesting thing.
Mr. WALTER. I think that is true of most of the people that are members of these Communist fronts. They should have been psychoanalyzed.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't understand the sense in which you were to be psychoanalyzed in going into the party. I can understand that about coming out of the party.
Mr. BASSMAN. No; my analogy was simply this, Mr. Tavenner: I had a very unhappy marriage.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't wish to go into personal things.
Mr. BASSMAN. I am not going to be personal. I am trying to explain my analogy of entering the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us about entering the party. I am not interested, particularly, in your analysis. We want to know of the exact facts about it.
Mr. BASSMAN. The fact is simply this: I went to these meetings because my wife asked me to accompany her. She went before I did and explained some of the functions to me, which were of no interest to me, but because we lived together as a family she thought that I should be involved with her in a project in which she had great interest. Well, I went. After going to a few meetings I decided it was not for me, and I just ceased going.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any further statement you want to make to the committee about your leaving the party ?
Mr. BASSMAN. Only to say that I never really felt that I left anything, because I never really felt that I belonged, but I stopped going because I had no interest and have never bothered with it since. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2369 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were the others who were members of this group with you?
Mr. BASSAAN. I didn't remember until I was shown Mr. Berkeley's testimony, and there were a couple of names on there that I recall. There were a couple on there that I don't recall or remember ever seeing at a meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Give us the names of those whom you recall were members.
Mr. BASSMAN. Well, there was a girl by the name of Babb, that I recall seeing at a meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that her first name or last name ?
Mr. BASSMAN. No; that is her last name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell it ?
Mr. BASSMAN. B-a-b-b.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is her first name?
Mr. BASSIIAN. Sonora.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you be more definite as to the first name ?
Mr. BASSMIA. As far as I remember I thought it was Sonora.
Mr. TAVENNER. Could it have been Sonja?
Mr. BASSMAN. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is Sonora according to your recollection?
Mr. BASSMAN. That is right. If you have the testimony I could tell you better. I really don't remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am advised that that is the correct name. And who were the others?
Mr. BASSMAN. Then I recall someone there who was in publicity by the name of Shapiro.
Mr. TAVENNER. Shapiro?
Mr. BASSAMAN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the first name?
Mr. BASSMAN. I don't know him well, I don't really remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. Male or female?
Mr. BASsMAN. A man.
Mr. JACKSON. Was it Victor Shapiro?
Mr. BASSMAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say his name was Victor Shapiro?
Mr. BASSMAN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long had you known Victor Shapiro?
Mr. BASSMAN. I had met him there and just saw him at those few meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was his activity in the meetings? 
Mr. BASSMAN. Mr. Tavenner, I don't remember anyone's activities at those meetings. I just remember that I went and usually held a book in my hand and listened, and couldn't wait to get out of there, and that is the truth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there others?
Mr. BASSMAN. There were a couple of other names in the testimony, but I don't remember them being at the meetings. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WALTER. Does the committee have any questions?
Mr. VELDE. I have no questions.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. Are you here in response to a subpena ? 2370 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. BASSMAN. No, sir; I came here because I felt that it was important for my work, which is in New York City, to have it on the record that whereas I may have at one time been a member of the Communist Party, I haven't been for over 12 years, that I am no longer interested in it, and I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I knew that this committee would give me this kind of a hearing. So to prospective employers in New York City, if the question were to come up, since I had been named, as to was I or am I or am I not a member, I could truthfully state that I am not.
Mr. JACKSON. You state under oath now that you have broken all connections, physical and philosophical, with the Communist Party?
Mr. BASSMAN. Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no further questions.
Mr. WALTER. Is there any reason why the witness should not be excused ? 
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir. 
Mr. WALTER. Thank you. The witness is excused. The committee will recess subject to the call of the Chair. (Whereupon, at 5: 15 p. m., the committee was recessed to be reconvened subject to the call of the Chair.) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 7 TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1952 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Washington, D.

Mr POMERANCE. I was born in New York City on August 2, 1905. 2371 2372 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please what your educa- tional training has been?
Mr. POMERANCE. I went to the public schools and a private school in New York City up till the age of 17, when I went to work.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession? 
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't have a profession. I am a businessman, a salesman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now live?
Mr. POMERANCE. New York City.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state briefly for the committee, please, what your record of employment has been, say, from 1935 until the present time?
Mr. POMERANCE. Well, actually, I did various jobs; and my first really continuous or permanent job that lasted for any time was with the NLRB. I went to work for the NLRB, I believe in December1 am not positive of the month-1937. I think it was 1937.
Mr. TAVENNER. And how long did you remain an employee of the National Labor Relations Board?
Mr. POMERANCE. I think it was until August of 1941. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Then what was your employment beginning with August 1941?
Mr. POMERANCE. I resigned from the Board in New York and went to work as the business agent for the Screen Cartoonists, Local 852, A. F. of L.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you assume your duties there?
Mr. POMERANCE. Immediately after I resigned from the Board.
Mr. TAvENNER. And that would have been approximately what date?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't recall the exact date, but it would have been in August, I think, or September, of 1941.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was your employer?
Mr. POMERANCE. The Screen Cartoonists, Local 852, A. F. of L., Painters International.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain employed by the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mr. POMERANCE. I am not sure of the month, but I think it was either November or December of 1944. I can't be sure of the month.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, after that, how were you employed ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was the executive secretary of the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. TAVENNER. And how long did you remain employed by the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. POMERANCE. I think it was December of 1946, either November or December. Again I am not positive of the year, but it was the end of 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. And after that, how were you employed?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was unemployed for about 6 months. Then I came to New York and was employed in a business that was exploiting or attempting to exploit an invention. This lasted only about- I can't recall exactly; I think it was less than a year. And then I went into another business, as salesman, and took care of sales for a com- pany making television commercials.
Mr. TAvENNER. Did your employment continue with that company? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2373 
Mr. POMERANCE. It has continued until the present except that in the past year I have been off payroll at least once for a long period because of my health.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Pomerance, you stated that beginning in December 1937 and continuing until August 1941, you were employed by the National Labor Relations Board. Where were you employed, and in what capacity ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was a field examiner, and I first was employed with the Board in the Atlanta, Ga., office for about 3 months, after which I was transferred to Los Angeles, where I worked as a field examiner until, I think, either the end of 1938-December of 1938. I transferred to L. A., I think, in March of 1938, and I left the end of 1939, when I was transferred to New York, to the New York office.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were your duties as a field examiner, when you took over your position in Georgia ?
Mr. POMERANCE. We were enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, and that involved investigating charges of unfair labor practices and running elections.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you function, and what part were you to play in running elections?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't recall the exact machinery any more of the Board, but when a case was filed concerning a question of representation, if the Board either ordered it it was voluntarily agreed to, we would set up the necessary machinery for holding an election, to decide who the bargaining agents were to be.
Mr. TAVENNER. Didn't your duties as a field examiner include the taking of a vote or the receiving of petitions to hold an election ?
Mr. POMERANCE. Well, after a case was filed, we would examine the situation to see if there was sufficient reason to hold the election, and also to get the parties together concerning the bargaining unit.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, specifically, wasn't it part of your duties to examine the cards, or the applications, of the members of a union in the preliminary step that was taken, to determine whether or not an election would be held?
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct, as I recall; against the payroll, to see if there was a sufficient reason to hold such an election. I think that was the way it was worked.
Mr. TAVENNER. And wasn't it provided by the regulations that a certain percentage of a union must make application for the holding of an election? I believe it was 20 percent, wasn't it?
Mr. POMfERANCE. I don't recall the percentage.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before an election would be held ? 
Mr. POMERANCE. I remember that there had to be sufficient reason to hold it. but I don't recall the percentage.
Mr. TAVENNER. And wasn't it your duty to take that petition with the names on it and check it to ascertain whether their names were legitimately used for that purpose, that is, to compare the signatures against known signatures of the individuals, for instance?
Mr. POMERANCE. I think that that was done where there was a consent to recognize the union without an election, that the Board sometimes would, by agreement between the company and the union, examine the cards and the payroll to see whether or not the union represented a majority. You are going back into machinery that I haven't been connected with in a long time. 2374 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWVOOD MOlION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. The purpose of my questioning along that line, is to ascertain from you whether or not a person employed as a field examiner, if he chose to do it, could influence the results by improperly considering these cards or applications or petitions as being bona fide, when they were not.
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't recall the exact machinery, but I am positive that that was impossible. At no time did I know, or has anybody ever charged, that any such thing happened. I don't remember the machinery, but I am positive no such thing could happen.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, if in the holding of a particular election, it was the duty of the field examiner to determine whether the names on the petition were put there in a bona fide way and were the signatures of the individuals, the true signatures, wouldn't the improper investigation of a matter of that kind have influenced the enforcement of the National Labor Relations Board matters ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I am trying to recall how it operated, and it seems to me that I know that on elections, when ballots were counted, there were always present not only the Board people but also members of the company and the union; and it seems to me that whenever cards were compared for purposes of certifying a union as the bargaining agent, there were present the company and the union.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand that you were transferred to Los Angeles after having served about 3 months in Georgia.
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your assignment in California ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was a field examiner.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you performed the same duties, general duties, which you have already described?
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then I believe it was the end of 1939, you testified, that you were transferred from Los Angeles to New York?
Mr. POMERANCE. Correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. What type of work were you assigned to in New York?
Mr. POMERANCE. The same; field examiner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, where? Where was your office?
Mr. POMERANCE. New York City.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the reason that you were assigned from Los Angeles to New York?
Mr. POMERANCE. Well, there was a difficulty in the office, a disagreement between the field examiners for the most part and the then director of the office, which resulted in my transfer as well as some other changes.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain as an employee of the National Labor Relations Board after your return to New York?
Mr. POMERANCE. I guess about a year and 8 or 9 months, something like that.
Mr. TAVENNER. That would bring you up to August 1941?
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the circumstances under which you left the employment of the National Labor Relations Board ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I resigned. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2375 
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to your resignation, had you been in contact with the Screen Cartoonists' Guild regarding employment in an official -capacity for it?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was made aware of the job just prior to my resignation.
Mr. TAVENNER. What I am getting at is this: Did you leave your employment with the National Labor Relations Board in order to accept employment with the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there any other reason that contributed to your leaving your position with the National Labor Relations Board?
Mr. POMERANCE. None.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your position with the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was the business agent.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who employed you?
Mr. POMERANCE. The guild, the union.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, I know, but the guild had to act through its officers in making its contact. Who handled the matter for the guild?
Mr. POMERANCE. I was elected by the membership.
Mr. TAVEXNER. Well, who was it that first conferred with you regarding acceptance of employment with the National Screen Cartoonists' Guild?
Mr. POMERANCE. I can't recall. There were several people. I don't think I would be able to say. I can't recall. I know there were a number that suggested it.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand you remained employed by the Screen Cartoonists' Guild until December of 1944.
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the circumstances under wluch you left that employment and went to the Screen Writers' Guild? Under which you went there as its executive secretary?
Mr. POMERANCE. I resigned.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give us the circumstances under which you were employed as secretary by the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. POMERAICE. As far as I remember, I was interviewed by a number of the executive board members.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were they?
Mr. POMERANCE. And the officers. Emmet Lavery was president. And I don't recall all the officers.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, who were those who talked to you about coming with the Screen Writers' Guild ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't recall all of them. I remember having lunch with Lavery and a couple of them, but I don't recall who was present.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well there are others who talked to you about the matter besides Mr. Lavery ?
Mr. POMERANCE. There were of the board.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us their names
Mr. POMERANCE. If I had a list of who was on the board, I might be able to recall some of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. We may return to that later. Were you ever employed by or connected in any way with the American Communications Association? 2376 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. POMERANCE. Very briefly-I dop't recall, but I think for about 2 months or so.
Mr. TAVENNER. Approximately when was that?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you relate it to your employment in these other capacities?
Mr. P( IIERANCE. It was before any of these employments.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was prior to your employment by the National Labor Relations Board?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that employment began in December 1937?
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to read to you a part of a letter directed to
Mr. Mervin Rathborne, president of the American Communications Association, which is set forth in the testimony of Mr. Frey when he appeared before this committee on August 13, 1938; that is, Mr. John P. Frey, president of the Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor. This letter appears at page 134, volume 1, of this committee's report, in 1938. I may preface the reading of the letter by stating that a Mr. Richard D. Hallett, H-a-l-l-e-t-t, wrote a letter of resignation addressed to
Mr. Rathborne, the president of the American Communications Association. Were you acquainted with Mr. Richard D. Hallett?
Mr. POMERANCE. I can't recall the name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Possibly this will refresh your recollection regarding the incident I want to interrogate you about.
Mr. IIERTIN RATHBORNE, President, American Communications Association, CIO, New York, N. Y. DEAR SIR: Kindly consider this my resignation not only as chairman but also as nienil er of the American Communications Association, effective immediately. Since I have been most acti e in the interests of ACA since the very beginning of its organizing canipaign in Washington, D C., and since I was the second Western Union man in the entire country to join ACA, this action calls for some explanation When I signed my application for membership in ACA on April 23, 1937, I bargained for unionism and unionism only I definitely did not bargain to aid or comfort or to support in any way financially or otherwise communism or any Communistic agencies. Howev er, during the 14 months of my chairmanship of local 35-B, ACA, I have not only received communications from numerous pseudopatriotic organizations askirg for support but have been strongly urged by numerous representatives of the national office of the ACA to support these organizations These aforementioned representatives of ACA included- various persons whose names appear here, including William Pomerance. Are you the William Pomerance referred to in the letter of resignation by Richard D. Hallett?
Mr. POMERANCE. I worked for ACA, and therefore I assume that I am the one he is referring to.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your duties as an employee of ACA?
Mr. POMERANCE. I went on a sort of survey for them through the South at a time when they were attempting to organize Postal Telegraph. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2377 
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, Mr. Hallett says that you, as a representative, called upon him to support certain pseudopatriotic organizations, which he claims and states was a part of his reason for resigning from the ACA. Now, what was it that you were asking him to do?
Mr. POMENANCE. May I speak to my counsel?
Mr. WOOD. You have a perfect right, sir, to consult with your counsel any time you desire. (Mr. Pomerance confers with Mr. Rein.)
Mr. TAVENNER, Now, you have conferred with counsel. Can you answer?
Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I can't recall the man at all, or his name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, aside from that, will you tell us whether or not you were soliciting funds or support from officials of the ACA in behalf of any organizations while employed by the ACA ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that under my rights under the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. You mean you refuse to answer the question?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline.
Mr. TAVENNER. On what ground ?
Mr. POMERANCE. The fifth amendment.
Mr. TAviNNER. You mean to state that you decline to answer the question on the ground that if you did answer it, it might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. POMERANCE. That's correct. 
Mr. JACKSON. In a criminal action? Incriminate you in a criminal action?
Mr. POMERANCE. I assume that's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to return now to a question I asked you a little while ago, regarding the persons in the Screen Writers' Guild who talked with you about your employment by the guild as its executive secretary. You stated you were unable to recall the names of the members of the executive board.
Mr. POMERANCE. And officers. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have before me a list of the members in 1946. Mr. Emmet Lavery was at that time president. The other officials of the executive board, or the other officers and executive members at that time, were: first vice president, Lester Cole. I suggest that as 1 read these names out, you write down any of those whom you talked to about your employment, and then when I have completed reading the list, tell me who they are. Second vice president, Howard Estabrook; third vice president, Oliver H. P. Garrett; secretary, Maurice Rapf; treasurer, Harold Buchman. Executive board: Harold Buchman, George Callahan, Richard Collins, Lester Cole, Gordon Kahn, Howard Koch, Emmet Lavery, Mary McCall, Jr., Frank Partos, Maurice Rapf, Marguerite Roberts. Alternates: John Wexley, Allen Scott, F. Hugh Herbert, Henry Myers, David Hertz, Waldo Salt; and at this time, 1946, the executive secretary was William Pomerance. Now, which of those, if any, conferred with you about your employ- ment with the Screen Writers' Guild, as executive secretary? 2378 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry, I don't recall. By listing everybody, you have more confused me. I think their records would show that they set up a conmmittee-they usually do-to interview persons. It would be much more accurate.
Mr. TAVENNER. That may be. But you should also know who conferred with you.
Mr. POMERANCE. I honestly don't remember. I honestly don't remember beyond the meeting with Lavery.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do remember that you met with others, but Lavery is the only name that you recall'9
Mr. POMERANCE. That's the way I remember it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Pomerance, I show you a photostatic copy of page 3 of the People's World, the issue of July 14. 1944, and I will ask you to look at the center of the page at a double column entitled, "Communist ban." This article has to do with the Los Angeles Central Labor Council rejecting a recommendation of the executive board to bar Communists. You will note a marked portion, where it is said that Bill Pomerance, business agent of the Screen Cartoonists' Guild,' and certain other persons, led the fight against banning Communists. Do you see that?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that a correct statement, that you were one of the leaders in the fight against banning Communists ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will ask you to look further in the article at the paragraph which I point out to you and ask you if you see whether or not it is stated that Pomerance said that the issue is not Communists. "We are not interested in them, but unity in the council." Do you see that statement ?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, do you have any explanation that you can make of the reason for that statement?
Mr. PO31ERANCE. Can I ask counsel, please ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. (Mr. Pomerance confers with his counsel.)
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't recall the statement.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you can easily see the sense of the statement by looking at it now. Regardless of whether you recall the statement, what reason could you have had for that statement?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't see how I can discuss a statement I didn't make. I don't remember making it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Central Labor Council at that time, July 14, 1944?
Mr. POIMERANCE. I believe so.
Mr. TAVEINER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at that time on that date, July 14, 1944?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. And could that have been the real reason why the statement is attributed to you that you were not interested in Commumnists, if made?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline, for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the time that you occupied the position of executive secretary of the Screen Writers' Guild ? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2379 
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at the time you were employed by the Screen Cartoonists' Guild ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Pomerance, a witness by the name of Martin Berkeley, appeared before the committee on Un-American Activities at its hearing conducted in Los Angeles of the 19th day of September 1951, and in the course of his testimony, lie had this to say in response to a question. (Representative Francis E. Walter entered the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. This question was asked: l n What fraction meetings did you attend I know ou wil ot be able to tell us that in detail, but give uasa general description of those meetings and the purposes of them
Mr. BERKELEY. Well, we had a fraction of the Screen Writers' Guild. The guild fraction, especially in its early days, and you gentlemen are quite familiar with the struggle we had in the early days of the guild, we had the advice of
Mr Charles Katz, an attorney at law in this town, in our legal problems in the guild. Mr. Katz was a member of the body Lester Cole. InanMcLellan Hunter, to ,liom I referred before, who was married to Alice Goldberg, John Wexley, W-e-x-l-e-y, the playright. Marguerite Roberts, who is a writer at MetroGoldwyn-Mayer, and the Charles Page I spoke about before who is no longer Fred Rinaldo, a writer, and his collaborator, with the State Department Bob Lees Question. Do you know whether that is the same Bob Lees 9who appeared before the Committee on Un-American Activities in Washington
Mr BERKELEY. It is, sir. And then, continuing: Albert Maltz, the writer Now we come to the third member of the party who was also an executive secretary of my guild, William Pomerance, who had been with the NLRB and who. on the recommendation of party members on the Board, was entrusted with the job ot guiding our guild through its struggle Question: Do you know anything about the connection of William Pomeranme with the National Labor Relations Board, or any function of that Board, prior to his coming to California?
Mr BERKELEY. Yes, sir. tHe was a member of the Board, I believe, in the South It may have been New Orleans; I'm not sure I know he worked with the NLRB down South and he worked with them back East. He was undei fire constantly for the stand he took He was suspected of having sympathies too far to the left. Either about the time he was to lose his job with the NLRB, or having lost it, the comrades out here felt that he was an ideal man to move into our guild and they promptly proceeded to move Pomerance into our guild. Question: Was he what is known as a field examiner with the National Labor Relations Board?
Mr BERKELEY. He was Question: Do you know whether at the time he was a member of the Communist Party here in California that he was serving in that capacity, that is, as a field agent of the National Labor Relations Board? Mir. BERKELEY. Do you mean whether I know at the time he was working for the Government he was also a party member? Question: Yes.
Mr. BERKELEY. Sir, I cannot say to my own personal knowledge. I can only say that he was brought out here by the party to work in the guild, and was a party member when he got here because he was brought right into our fraction. I can presume from that that he was a party member before he reached California Now, do you have any statement that you desire to make in explanation or in denial of the testimony given by Mr. Martin Berkeley to this committee 2380 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer, if that is a question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, I will ask you, to be specific, whether or not
Mr. Martin Berkeley's statement was true, or false?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer, on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Fleury, Mrs. Bernice Polifka Fleury, testified before the committee in Los Angeles on September 24, 1951. Mrs. Fleury had described to the committee meetings which she had, Communist Party meetings which she attended at the homes of various persons. She was asked this question: Will you tell us who met with you in these groups? First, I want to make certain that the persons you have mentioned were persons known to you to be members of the Communist Party, if they were. What persons who were members of the Communit Party met with you in these meetings?
Mrs. FLEURY.I believe, sir, there are only two persons-I beg your pardon?
Mr WAITER Go ahead. Proceed.
Mrs F'EURY. I believe there are only two persons which it would be at all possible foi me to connect with the Communist Party. One of them is Mr. William Pomrerince, and one is Mr. David Hilberman. Question: * * * What were the circumstances under which you met with them in the Communist Party matters?
Mrs. Fi EURY.At the same meetings about art, sameQuestion: Where were these meetings held?
Mrs Fi EURY.They were held at various houses. I remember going to meetings at Mr Hilberman's. I remember going to meetings at Mr. Pomerance's. I remember going to meetings at other houses who, believe me, I cannot remember whose house they were or where they were. I understand, also, that my husband, in his previous testimony to this committee, mentioned that there was a meeting nt our house I do not remember that meeting at all. We have discussed it since and evidently I either was out of town or-evidently, the only thing we can think of is that I was out of town. Question: Well, how did you learn when and where meetings were to be held?
Mrs Fi.EUsR. Well, it was a very vague thing. Somebody would say, "Well let's meet 2 weeks from today at such and such a house." Perhaps you would get a phone call putting it over for a couple of weeks or perhaps someone would say. "Well, we are going to get together at" somebody's. There was no regular routine at any time on where we were to meet. Question: Well, how did you go to the places of these meetings? What means of transportation did you have?
Mrs FLEURY. When my husband was in the Army, I was very often picked up by either Mr. Hilbeiman or Mr. Pomerance, inasmuch as we lived in the same district of the Los Angeles area. Is there any comment that you desire to make, either by way of denial or explanation of the testimony of Mrs. Fleury regarding your alleged Communist Party membership?
Mr. PnaMERANCE. I decline to answer that, on the same grounds.
Mr. WonD. Permit me to ask the witness a question at that point,
Mr. Counsel. I will ask you, Mr. Pomerance, whether or not the testimony you have just heard read by Mr. Tavenner, referring to you to have been known to her as being a member of the Communist Party and attending these meetings, is true. Is that testimony true, or false?
Mr. POMAERANCE. I decline to answer that, sir.
Mr. TAVENNFR. At the time that you were an employee for the National Labor Relations Board in New York, were you a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time that you were an employee of the National Labor Relations Board in California as a field examiner, which was from an early date in 1938 until the end of 1939, were you at any time a member of the Communist Party? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2381

Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I am not aware of all the legal-of the law, on this, and I therefore have taken that position. (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the room at this point.

Mr. POMERANCE. What, sir?

Mr. WALrER. I will withdraw the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know anything about the circumstances of the organization of the Hollywood Democratic Committee?

Mr. TAVENNER. You are acquainted witl the fact, are you not, that the Hollywood Democratic Committee was cited by the California Committee on Un-American Activities by its report in 1948 in this form: This Communist front grew out of a series of fronts designed to entrap Hollywood innocents in the motion-picture industry.

Mr. TAN ENNER. Mr. Pomerance, according to an article appearing in the People's World of December 16, 1943, a provisional committee was set up to organize the People's Educational Association, and, according to the article, M. William Pomerance, business agent of Screen Cartoonists, Local 852, was a member of that committee. I hand you a photostatic copy of the article and ask you whether or not you served as a member of the committee to organize the People's Educational Association?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer on the same grounds. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2385 
Mr. TAVENNER. Referring to People's Daily World of April 19, 1946, William Pomerance, business agent of the Screen Writers' Guild was engaged in conducting a class on the Film Industry Today, at the People's Educational Center, and then also another class on "The trade-union line-up in Hollywood." I hand you a photostatic copy of the clipping from the April 19, 1946, isue of the People's Daily World, and I will ask you to state how clearance was obtained for you in your work or in your participation in teaching at the People's Educational Center.
Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I don't understand.
Mr. WALTER. Where was that?
Mr. TAVENNER. In Los Angeles.
Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I don't understand the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me ask you first if you did engage in teaching courses at the People's Educational Center?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. I referred you there to the article reciting that you did conduct a class on "The film industry today" and another class on "The trade-union line-up in Hollywood." Did you conduct either of those classes, or any other classes?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, will you tell the committee how teachers were selected to conduct courses in the People's Educational Center, that is, whether or not there were special groups who had to pass upon the qualifications of the teacher or any other matter relating to the teacher?
Mr. POMERANGE. I think I declined to answer any questions about my connections with that organization.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Pomerance, did you ever see this article that appeared on the 19th of April, 1946, in the Peoples Daily World?
Mr. POMERANCE. I can't recall, sir.
Mr. WALTER. Do you deny that you are the William Pomerance mentioned in this article?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't.
Mr. WALTER. You do not ?
Mr. POMERANCE. It is there.
Mr. WALTER. Well, are you the same William Pomerance who is mentioned in this article ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I assume so.
Mr. WALTER. Well, if you are, then you were a teacher in this school?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline, under my constitutional rights under the fifth amendment, to answer any questions about the school, because it appears as a subversive organization, both in this committee and in the Tenney committee hearings, I am told.
Mr. WALTER. You have just testified that you are the William Pomerance mentioned in this article. This article concerns a school. Now, is that the fact or isn't it?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. I think the record should show positively that the People's Educational Center, incorporated under the name of "Los 2386 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY Angeles Educational Association, Inc.," also known as People's University, People's School, and People's Educational Association, was cited as Communist and subversive by Attorney General Tom Clark in a list furnished the Loyalty Review Board and released on June 1 and September 21, 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you aware of the fact that this school had been cited as a Communist-front organization?
Mr. POAIERANCE. I think Mr. Jackson said the date was 1948.
Mr. TAVENN.ER. Yes, sir. I aim asking you if you ever learned the fact that it was cited in 1948?
Mr. POM3ERANcr. Yes. I don't remember whether it was in 1948, but I have learned of the fact, yes, that it was cited.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of course, in 1948, you were living in New York; were you not?
Mr. POMERANCE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever make a public pronouncement of any kind of disaffiliation with that school?
Mr. POMIERANCE. I don't recall that I said I was affiliated with it, or I refused to answer the question with regard to that.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to an article in the People's World of October 6, 1944, the American Youth for Democracy sponsored a teen-age mock congress at the Virgil High School, Los Angeles. I show you the article and call your attention to the fact that in the place underscored your name appears as the sponsor or consultant. Do you recall that ? 'r. POMrEIRANCE. I decline to answer that question on the same gre ids.
Mr. TTVENNER. The Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications, published by this committee on May 14, 1951, shows that the American Youth for Democracy was cited as subversive and Communist by Attorney General Tom Clark, by letter to the Loyalty Review Board, released December 4, 1947, and that it was cited as the new name under which the Young Communist League operates and which also largely absorbed the American Youth Congress, according to the report of this committee, the Committee on Un-American Activities, in its report of March 29, 1944. After the citation of this group by this committee on March 29, 1944, did you do anything to disassociate yourself from it ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I don't recall that I admitted that I was associated with it.
Mr. TAVENNER. No, you have not. 
Mr. POMERAIn CE. I don't think you asked me the question about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were you associated at any time in any manner with the American Youth for Democracy?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that question on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. The "win the peace" conference was held in Washington, 1). (.. on April 5 to 7, 1946, according to the Daily Worker of April 3. 1946.
Mr. ViLDE. Mr. Counsel, do you have the date that the AYD succeeded the YCL? According to your statement there, the report of thie (onmmittee on Un-American Activities was in 1944.
Mr. J WKsOXN. It was formed in October 1943.
Mr ViLDE. The AYD? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2387 
Mr. JACKSON. Yes. It succeeded the Young Communist League.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; there is another citation which shows that fact. I was saying that, according to the Daily Worker of April 3, 1946, Wilham Pomerance of the Hollywood Citizens' Commnittee, attended that conference, that is, the conference in Washington from April 5 to 7, 1946. Will you examine the photostatic copy of the issue of the Daily Worker of April 3, 1946, and state whether or not it is correct in stating that you were scheduled to attend that conference?
Mr. POMEtRANCE. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you attend the conference in Washington, that is, the conference of April 5 to 7, 1946, a "win the peace" conference ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer the question, on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you aware of the fact that the Attorney General classified the National Committee to Win the Peace as a Communist organization, as subversive and Communist, on December 4, 1947?
Mr. POMERANCE. I suspect it was. I cannot recall specifically.
Mr. WALTER. Why do you suspect that ? He described it as being a Communist organization.
Mr. POMERANCE. Because a number of people had so stated, and the press has carried that story.
Mr. WALTER. It wasn't because you knew it was a Communist organization ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer the question regarding the organization.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you an official of the Hollhwood Writers' Mobilization or did you hold any official position with that organization?
Mr. POMERANCE. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you aware that it, too, has been cited as a Communist-front organization?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you ever affiliated with any organization devoted to the defense of Harry Bridges?
Mr. POIMERANCE. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you ever affiliated with or did you ever aid in any way the work of the Bridges' Victory Committee?
Mr. POMERANCE. I dechne to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with the fact that the Harry Bridges Victory Committee was cited by the Special Committee on Un-American Activities on March 29, 1944, as a Communist-front organization operating in San Francisco, and that after the Communist Party became prowar, Harry Bridges, a Communist Party member and leader of the Communist Party, planned a general strike in San Francisco in 1944, was threatened with deportation, the defense against which was almost entirely in the hands of Communists? Were you acquainted with that fact, that is, the fact that it had been so cited by this committee ? 2388 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY

Mr. JACKSON. I hardly think so, in the matter of the Communist Party. I think it is pretty clear in your mind whether you are going to be a Communist when you walk out of the door or not.
Mr. POMERANCE. I answered that as truthfully as I can, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. You have no intention at the present time of becoming a member of the Communist Party ?

Mr. POMERANCE. I think it was appointive, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. With whom did you carry on negotiations for your employment? Who appointed you?
Mr. POMERANCE. I think there was a change of Secretaries at the time I came in. I made application when Mr. Wolf was Secretary of the Board. Mr. Witt subsequently became a member, but as I understood it, the Board passed on all of the employees, as I met the Board members at that time.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you receive a written appointment as a member of the NLRB?
Mr. POMERANCE. As I say, I can't recall whether it was written or not.

Mr. POMERANCE. It is a long time ago.
Mr. JACKSON. With whom did you carry on negotiations for employment as a business agent for the Screen Cartoonists' Guild?

Mr. POMERANCE. I think William Littlejohn, but I wouldn't be sure of that. The record will show.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the secretary ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I don't remember.
Mr. JACKSON. You were business agent for the Screen Cartoonists' Guild, were you not?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes, sir.

Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I thought you said when I was hired by them.
Mr. JACKSON. During your tenure as business agent.
Mr. POMERANCE. I am sorry. I don't remember the name of the secretary.
Mr. JACKSON. How many members were there in the Screen Cartoonists' Guild ?

Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name?
Mr. POMERANCE. R-u-y-z, I think. I am a very bad speller.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the first name?
Mr. POMERANCE. P-e-p-e.
Mr. JACKSON. You were shown by counsel an affidavit that you signed in 1941 stating that you were not a member of any organization which sought the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence. Would you sign such an affidavit today?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Would you have signed one yesterday?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Would yo have signed one a week ago?
Mr. POMERANCE. Yes, sir.

Mr. POMERANCE. No, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you believe that the Communist Party advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence ?
Mr. POMERANCE. I am not prepared to go into any discussion on that. I am no student of sufficient stature to discuss that question.
Mr. WooD. By that you mean you have no opinion on the subject, sir?
Mr. POMERANCE. Well, I would never agree with anything that would go for force and violence in relation to the overthrow of the Government.
Mr. WOOD. You are asked whether or not, in your opinion, the Communist Party, as it is constituted, has as one of its objectives, the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence. Your reply was that you feel you are not qualified to discuss that question. My question is: Have you any opinion on the subject?
Mr. POMERANCE. No, sir.

Mr. POMERANCE. I would not have any opinion about what this committee recommends.
Mr. JACKSON. Of course, you understand that the end product of this committee is recommendation of remedial legislation, and if you don't understand it, I will read it into the record at this time. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Are there any further questions by counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.
Mr. Pomerance, you stated that at the time of your employment by the National Labor Relations Board, a person by the name of Witt, I believe, you said, was counsel; is that right?
Mr. POMERANCE. No; he was secretary, as I remember it.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was his first name?
Mr. POMERANCE. Nathan Witt.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Nathan Witt confer with you prior to your appointment, regarding your appointment? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2393 
Mr. POMERANCE. I made application to Wolf, who was the secretary just prior to Witt, and met with him and then later I met Mr. Witt.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Mr. Witt have anything to do by way of recommendation or otherwise toward bringing you into the organization of the National Labor Relations Board?
Mr. POMERANCE. I assume that he did, because I got the appointment, but I know that I met with the Board members.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am speaking of in addition to his official act at the time you were employed ?
Mr. I'OMERANCE. No; I didn't know the man.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you obtain your employment with the Board?
Mr. POMEFRANCE. I made application and I had several letters, I think, of recommendation. The file would show it. I am sure the Board file would show it.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Do you know that Nathan Witt was a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. POMERANCE. No, I don't.

Mr. POMERANCE. No, sir.
