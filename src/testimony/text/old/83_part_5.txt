VI INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UK-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif. EXECUTIVE SESSION A subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities met, pursuant to call, at 3:10 p. m., in room 527-DU, United States Post Office and Court House Building, Los Angeles, Calif., Hon. Harold H. Velde (chairman), presiding. Committee member present: Representative Harold H. Velde. Staff member present: Raphael I. Nixon, director of research.
Mr. VELDE. Acting upon the authority vested in me as chairman of the Conmmittee on Un-Amiercan Activities, I have appointed myself as a subcommittee of one for the purpose of this executive session.
Mr. Nixon, will you please call the witness.
Mr. NIXON. Charles H. Garrigues. 
Mr. VELDE. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I do.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Nixon, will you proceed. TESTIMONY OF CHARLES H. GARRIGUES
Mr. NixoN. Mr. Garrigues, are you appearing in response to a subpena ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I am.
Mr. NIxoN. And will you state your full name?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. Charles H. Garrigues.
Mr. NIXON. When and where were you born, Mr. Garrigues?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Before I answer, may I ask this question: Is this proceeding now considered a part of the main hearing?
Mr. NIxoN. Yes. 
Mr. GARRIGUES. This is evidence before the committee?
Mr. NIXON. For the purpose of the record, Mr. Velde is sitting as a subcommittee of one for the purpose of receiving your testimony.
Mr. GARRIGUEs. This is a public record ?
Mr. NIXON. Yes, sir.
Mr. GARRIGUES. I wanted to be sure of that. I was born in Kansas in 1902.
Mr. NIxoN. Where do you now reside?
Mr. GARRIGUES. At 1623 Per Alta, Albany, Calif. 848 COMMUiNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. NIxoN. Are you presently employed?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. I am, with the San Francisco Examiner. 
Mr. NIXON. How long have you been so employed ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Since 1939.
Mr. NIXON. Will you state briefly what your previous occupational background is?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I have been a newspaperman for-comnenced about 1922, working on many papers in southern California and Arizona. In 1926 I came to Los Angeles and worked on the old Express, and I moved to the old Herald in 19-I think it was 1929. I went fo the Daily News, where I was employed, with various leaves of absence, until, I think, 1935.
Mr. NIXON. During the course of those leaves of absence did you have other employment
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, I did. I was engaged during most of that time in which I was working with the News as the political expert or political editor, and from time to time I was assigned by Mr. Boddy to take leave and work for various civic and governmental organizations as an investigator of conditions. And at 2 or 3 times I was employed during those periods as investigator for the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, or the District Attorney's Office, I am not sure which.
Mr. NIXON. In a special capacity ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. In a special capacity; yes.
Mr. NIxoN. Now, in order to complete the record, will you tell the committee what your educational background was prior to that?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I graduated from the Per Alta High School in 1919 and spent 1 year at the University of Southern California.
Mr. NIXON. Are you presently employed in a writing capacity?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. No; I am what you would call a copyreader, subeditor. That is one who reads copy and writes headlines.
Mr. NIXON. I understand that. During most of this period you have been associated in the field of journalism, has it been in a writing capacity?
Mr. GARRIGUES. No, chiefly as a copyreader, except when I was working on the Daily News.
Mr. NIxoN. What was your employment during the period of approximately 1935 to 1939?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Well, it was very scattered and vague. I really have to think.
Mr. NIXON. Just generally, I mean. Was there any particular period of employment with any paper or publication during that period of time?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Well, I edited a little paper called the Utopian News for several months. I was engaged in political work as a free-lance public relations man at various times.
Mr. NIXON. When you say "political," what do you mean ?
Mr. GARIrGUEs. I had a bureau, a public relations bureau, and we hired ourselves out to candidates, prepared their copy andMr. NrxoN. For campaign purposes?
Mr. GARRGUEs. For campaign purposes, yes, sir.
Mr. NIXON. Now, has there been any time during this period that you have related that you had occasion to join the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, I did join the Communist Party. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 849 
Mr. NIXON. Would you tell the committee the circumstances of your joining?
Mr. GARRIGUES. If I may, I would like to go back to the inception, when I started the trend again.
Mr. NIxow. The committee would be glad to hear.
Mr. GARRIGUES. My first contact with the Communist Party was inI think during the presidential campaign of 1934, when I was employed on the Daily News, and I was assigned there to go down and interview William Z. Foster.
Mr. NIXON. Just for the purpose of clarification here, I don't believe there was a presidential campaign in 1934.
Mr. GARRIGUES. It could not have been. It must have been 1932.
Mr. NIXON. 1932 or 1936.
Mr. GARRIGUES. 1932.
Mr. NIXON. For the presidential campaign of President Roosevelt against President Hoover?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes. That was 1932, of course it was.
Mr. NIxoN. Continue. You saw William Z. Foster?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I was assigned to go and interview him, which I did. I was rather impressed by the man's attitude, wrote what I would consider a very favorable honest interview, was quite proud of the fact that it was probably the first honest interview written of a Communist and published in a Los Angeles newspaper.
Mr. NIxoN. For what newspaper was this?
Mr. GARRIGUES. This was the Daily News. At that time I wasyou remember that was the depth of the depression, and one of my jobs was meeting the people who came to the Examiner-to the Newsexcuse me-in search of some kind of help. Many people came there very desperate for food or paying their rent, and during many days 20 and 30 sometimes, and I would question them and sometimes, very frequently call reports in to the WPA, I would very frequently call friends of mine at the city and county offices and ask them to help this particular family or that particular family. After this interview with Foster I began to-or the boys came and called upon me, several Commies whom I don't now recall, and they made no particular impression on me.
Mr. NIxoN. They were known to you as Communists or so identified themselves?
Mr. GARRIGUES. They identified themselves as Communists.
Mr. NIXON. All Communists, were they ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. As well as people of all other left-wing political beliefs. And during the campaign I had contact for the first time with what the people called first just "the movement," which consisted of the Communists, Guild Socialists, Walker Socialists, Utopian Socialists, remnants of the old IWW, as well as merely ordinary socialists and left-wing Democrats, and noted trade unionists, began to come in later, I think. They didn't make too much impression upon me, except I became aware for the first time that there was a good body of political theory which I was not familiar with. During those times when I was engaged in political work for Mr. Boddy, the publisher of the News, as a reform investigator, I had begun to theorize a great deal about the basis of the American Gov- 850 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA ernment, municipal and higher governments, and had at various times started preparation of a book relating to some of my experiences as an investigator, and some of the things which I thought could be done and could not be done and should be done or should not be done in order to save the American system from downfall from internal corruption. As my experience in that direction became w ider I began to have more and more definite ideas, and by 1935 they had begun to crystallize in a book in which I set forth quite completely my conclusions as to the relationships between business and government, the genesis of graft, and that sort of thing.
Mr. NIXON. Now, fixing this again in period of time, you just referred to 1935. What was the commencement of this feeling? 1932, 1929?
Mr. GARRIGUES. The commencement of the feeling of relationship ?
Mr. Nixox. That is right, or that tendency or thought?
Mr. GARIGUrES. My interest in the subject ?
Mr. NixoN. That is right.
Mr. GARRIGUES. Mv interest in the subject began when I was a kid. The first work I did I was a newspaper editor in Venice, Calif., when Venice had a realty boom in 1922. I didn't have any opportunity to do any more investigation probably until 1930, when I assisted in the prosecution, the detection and prosecution of certain people known as the dam graft ring, which sent a couple of men to the penitentiary, and out of that there came not only the political idea, you might say moral idea of what should be done, but I was interested to see if it was possible to convict a bribery case solely on circumstantial evidence, and they did that in the first bribe case in American jurisprudence with no evidence other than circumstantial, got a conviction and got it sustained by the Supreme Court.
Mr. NixoN. All right. We will get down to the actual period of your joining. You have previously referred to your interview with William Z. Foster. Am I to understand that that was in connection with his presidential candidacy at that time
Mr. GAmRIGUES. Yes.
Mr. NIxoN. And it was an assigned interview? Mi GARRIGUES. It was an assigned interview, just as any newspaperman would be assigned. The particular topic was how it feels to be a presidential candidate. He had been beaten up by a bunch of hoodlums in I believe one campaign speech, and I was assigned the job of finding out how it feels to be a presidential candidate and to be beaten up in his campaign
Mr. Nixo- As I understand from what you said before, you were given what you considered a completely objective interview?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes.
Mr. NixoN By Mr. Foster?
Mr. G \RRInUES. Well, he presented his point of view, and I tried to get his personal point of view as accurately as I could.
Mr. Nixox. In repeating it, you mean
Mr. GARRIGUES. In repeating it, yes.
Mr. NIXON. That, as the record shows, was in 1932. It was not at that time that you actually joined the Communist Party.
Mr. GARRIGUEs. No, that was my first contact with it, as I say. Then increasingly during the rest of the depression I began to come COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 851 in contact with this segment of society who called themselves "the movement," and in 1935 when I left the News-I think it was 1935. Now, maybe I am wrong on the date. Late in 1935 or early in 1936, possibly. I had just finished my first book, and it was accepted and I then began to debate the idea of doing another book on the relationship between labor and governent, the potentialities in there. At that time I had been employed-it must have been in 1936. I was employed by a committee working for Harlan Palmer for district attorney, and after that campaign ended I went to San Diego. I was then employed by the King-Ramsey-Connor defense committee; investigated a murder trial in Alameda County a couple months, where I met more and nore Communists I came back to San Diego and went to work for the San Diego Sun. That must have been early in 1937. And at that time I decided that I would make a thorough investigation of the potentialities of the labor movement in the same manner that I had previously done with the graft situation, except to approach it on a different angle. I went down to the Communist Party offices and book shop, headquarters in San Diego, and told them, this man there, that I wanted to join the party. He handed me a card and I signed it. And a couple of months later or possibly a month, about that time, I would say, I had a call from him that I was to meet a certain man at a certain place. I remember who, but where I don't recall.
Mr. NixoN. Fromn that you recruited yourself actually in the Communist Party.
Mr. GARRIGUES. That is right.
Mr. NIXON. There was no effort other than the initiation that you made in going to the headquarters and expressing your interest in becoming a member
Mr. GAjRRIUEs. That is right. lMr. NixoN. Who was it that you met?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Stanley Hancock, the county organizer.
Mr. NIXON. He was county organizer of the Communist Party in San Diego at that time. Was there the formality of issuing you a card? Mi. G RRCIGciE. II- issued me a card or a book, I don't remember now which it was.
Mr. Nixox. Were there any instructions given to you as to future meetings or activities?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes. I was told that I was to-the party would keep in contact with me, but that I was to keep undercover, not to expose myself, and they would have more information for me later.
Mr. NIXON. Hancock was the only one that you met at this particular time .
Mr. GARRIGUES. At that particular tune, yes. 
Mr. Nixox. During that period of time were you given any instructions or indoctrination instructions into the party, or Marxism?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Well, by this time I had begun to read theoretical Marxism, which is what I say most interested me, that aspect of it. There was a person who came to me or called me from time to time, would come to me from time to time and bring me pamphlets and books.
Mr. NIXON. Do you recall the identity of any of those? 852 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes. His name was Morrie Smolan.
Mr. NIXON. You were not throughout the period of time assigned to any particular group or anything, but more in a position of a member at large ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, for a little while; I don't remember how long. As a matter of fact, I know I was regarded with considerable suspicion at first.
Mr. NIXON. Why?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Because I had recruited myself.
Mr. NIXON. At the time of your recruitment, you made it known to them that you were in the newspaper field?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes; I told them. They knew my background.
Mr. NIxoN. Was there anyone else beside Stanley Hancock and Morrie Smolan that you recall now ?
Mr. GArRIGUES. Well, not very definitely, other than a fellow named Dick, who was a-I can't remember his name. I think his last name was Richards. They called him Dick.
Mr. NIxoN. But you are not sure what his first name was. Is there any other identifying data that you could now recall ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Not in relation to him. I would know him if 1 saw him.
Mr. NIXON. Was he a party functionary ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. A part-time party functionary or something.
Mr. NIXON. Was there any time while you were in San Diego that you were assigned to a particular group or unit of the party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I am under the impression I got, that those were a group, and I can remember one meeting in particular at which Hancock was not present and there was some criticism of Hancock. I think he was later disciplined or something at that time in connection with something at that meeting. But who was there except for Dick and a woman-I can't remember who the woman was, but her name is Bessie, but I couldn't identify her. She is a housewife.
Mr. NIXON. And then I think you referred to having left San Diego. When was that?
Mr. GARRIGUES. That was in-must have been probably October of 1937.
Mr. NIXON. Where did you go?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I came to Los Angeles.
Mr. NIXON. Was your party affiliation transferred from San Diego to Los Angeles ?
Mr. GARRIGES. Yes; it must have been.
Mr. NIXON. And you continued in the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, I came up here; they asked me, that is, the newspaper guild-of course, by this time I was a part-time organizer employed either by the American Newspaper Guild or by the CIO in San Diego, I am not sure where my pay came from, or maybe from both. And they were having trouble in the guild in Los Angeles, and the guild officers here asked me to come up.
Mr. Nixox In connection with your work nmorganizing the guild, did you receive any instructions or directives from the Communist Party as to what action your work should be directed to?
Mr. GARRIGCES. Not in the sense of instructions or directions; no. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 853 
Mr. NIXoN. Well, would it be on a basis that because of your knowledge of the purposes and your activities in the party, that your direction or the activities that you used in organizing the guild were influenced by the Communist Party to the extent that you were a member of the Communist Party as well as an organizer for this particular organization?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Well, I think you can go further than that. I was in the Communist Party, at least in theory, because I believe in the importance of the labor movement as such. The guild, according to the theory under which we were working, was a very important aspect of that labor movement, and anything I could do to strengthen the labor movement-Mr. NIXON. By the guild are you referring to the Communist Party ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I am referring to both, although I mean the labor movement particularly.
Mr. NIXON. Particularly in regard to aiding the Communist Party ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes; that is right.
Mr. NIxoN. When you came to Los Angeles, were you assigned to any unit or group of the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes; I was assigned to a unit. I remember going to the first meeting, because it was not a meeting, it was actually just not a real party meeting. But I think I stayed in that unit, or possibly another unit was formed later, but I didn't meet very much with the unit. 
Mr. NIXON. Were the components of this unit from the newspaper field only, or was it a miscellaneous unit?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Well, it was preponderantly so, but I think somewhat mixed.
Mr. NIXON. Do you recall any individuals who were in this unit ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Well, not too thoroughly, not too distinctly, for this reason, that I don't say I don't recall any of them, butMr. NIXON. During the course of the interrogation here there are certain names that I will ask you if you can recall. During the organization of the guild was any outside help given to you?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Any help from outside the guild? 
Mr. NIXON. No; from outside of Los Angeles, in the organizing of the unit.
Mr. GARRIGUES. No; I think not. 
Mr. NIXON. Do you recall a person named Morgan Hull?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Oh, yes; I recall Morgan Hull. Morgan Hull was a member of the Los Angeles guild.
Mr. NIXON. Was he in it at the time that you first knew him ? Were you in the unit when Morgan Hull joined the unit, or was he already in the unit when you joined up ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. My impression is that Morgan Hull was a Communist Party member long before I was and before there was a guild. I knew him previously. He and I worked on the same paper.
Mr. NIxoN. During the course of that period did you know an individual named Lou Amster ?
Mr. GARRIGuEs. Yes; I knew a Lou Amster. My impression is-Mr. NIXON. Is it a definite impression? 
Mr. GAmRIGUES. Not too definite.
Mr. NIXON. It is only an impression? 854 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes. Well, it is a recollection.
Mr. NIXON. Do you recall an individual named Leo Selkowski ?
Mr. GARRIGES. Yes; I knew Leo Selkowski.
Mr. NIXON. Did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I don't know whether I knew him to be in the party.
Mr. NIXON. Did you know Urcel Daniel ?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. Yes; I knew her.
Mr. NIXON. For the record, Miss Daniel has appeared before the committee and has admitted past membership in the Communist Party. Did you know her during the time as a member of the party ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. My impression is that she was the secretary of our unit, but the date I can't remember just now. It was sometime during the period. Just when, I can't remember.
Mr. NIXON. Was that unit to any degree financing the guild, your Communist Party unit?
Mr. GARRIGES. Well, I think-it is hard to remember. I am trying to place it as closely as I can, but most of the unit members, that is, the party members were guild members unquestionably, not all of them, I think, but probably most of them. They were possibly during that time-this was the period, if you recollect, right after I got into Los Angeles, and they had at the time the policy of having open meetings, where there were various types of open meetings, but there was no longer, as I understood at the time, there were no longer occasional fraction meetings of the guild, but the progressive interest we had in that term came from our crucial problems, and we had 1 or 2 or 3 or more nonparty members who were progressing the labor movement.
Mr. NIXON. That is, you mean some of the individuals who were in attendance were not necessarily Communist Party members to have been in attendance?
Mr. GARRIGUES. That is right, and it is very difficult to distinguish between the two.
Mr. NIXON._In those instances in which there is no question in your mind, for the matter of the record, we want it indicated by you. I mean the basis of the interrogation or the questioning is to have you identify the names of certain individuals whom you are certain of, but if there is any question in your mind, make it known so that the record will be complete on it.
Mr. GARRIGUES. Let me say this before that, that I remember distinctly 5 or 6 members of them that were in this labor guild mobilization. Now, I don't think they were all Communists. I think 2 or 3 of them were, and then there may be certain others that were in there at the time.
Mr. NIxoN. Did you know a person named Burke?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes.
Mr. NIxoN. Did you know Burke to be a Communist?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. Yes; I know that he was in.
Mr. NIXON. Dorothy Healey ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I knew her before I was in the party, and we had a good many discussions.
Mr. NIXON. Charles Judson?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I knew Judson. I know he has testified that he was not in the party, but I could say definitely he was. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 855 
Mr. NIXON. I think that during the course of Mr. Judson's testimony, I believe he is one of the individuals who testified to his having been a member of the Communist Party. Do you remember Paul Cline?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes. Paul Cline was a party organizer, if that is-I want to get that name right now. This is Paul Cline who was the party organizer.
Mr. NIXON. Do you know a Minua Klein ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes; I knew Minna Klein. I think she was a writer, but I don't know her as a party member, honestly. She was one of the people we saw.
Mr. NIXON. For identification, she was the wife of Herbert Klein.
Mr. GAPMIGUES. Yes, I knew Herbert, but whether they were party membersMr. NIXON. Did you know a William E. Oliver Mi. GARRIGUES. Yes.
Mr. NIXON. Did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. No, not at the time that I was there. I might say that there was some effort to recruit him at one time.
Mr. NIXON. During the course of the testimony before the Committee on Un-American Activities, Miss Alice Bennett identified both Minna Klein and William E. Over as having been in this unit of the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild. Did you know Philip Johnson?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Y.I mean not at the time. I know him now, but I did not at the time.
Mr. NIXON. Do you know George Shaffer?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, I did. George Shaffer?
Mr. NIXON. That is S-h-a-f-f-e-r.
Mr. GARRIGuES. I saw him hand out a lot of folders. I know there are two people there.
Mr. NIXON. Do you know Ed Robbins?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, I think I know him. I did meet him.
Mr. NIXON. Did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I think he was.
Mr. NIXON. Did you know Sarah Bognoff?
Mr. GARRIGUEs. Yes, I met Sarah Bognoff working in, I think she was in the guild offices or some other union office.
Mr. NIXON. You know her as a member of the party ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I know her as a member of the party.
Mr. NIXON. Tom O'Connor?
Mr. GARRIGUES. I know him as a newspaperman.
Mr. NIXON. Hai e you during the course of your membership in the Communist Party been assigned any Communist name or any party name '
Mr. GARRIGUES. Yes, I took a party name of E. Scott. 856 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. NIXON. When did you leave the Communist Party ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. In 1939.
Mr. NIxoN. Was there any formality in your leaving or did you merely drift away from the party and was there an actual break in your membership?
Mr. GAxaIGEs. Well, there was a break when I came to Los Angeles. I had no more contact with the party for a year or two.
Mr. NIXON. Can you remember the approximate date ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. It must have been the early part of 1939.
Mr. NIXON. Was there any occasion or reason for you to feel all the time that you were in the Communist Party that it was a revolutionary party or was a conspiracy in the sense of advocating the overthrow of this Government, as it was stated?
Mr. GARRIGUES. No, not in the sense in which the terms are now being used. That was not my experience with it at all. That was the particular point I studied most carefully. I didn't want to be in such a conspiracy.
Mr. NIXON. After you left Los Angeles and left the Communist Party, were any efforts made to recruit you into the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES. No.
Mr. NIXON. You were not contacted subsequently to be reactivated ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. Not at any time, no.
Mr. NIXON. And since the time you left you have had no further dealing with the Communist Party?
Mr. GARRIGUES That is correct, none whatsoever.
Mr. NIXON. And you have not been a member of the Communist Party since that time ?
Mr. GARRIGUES. That is correct.
Mr. NIXON. Well, I want to express my appreciation for the information which you have given us.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Garrigues, on behalf of the entire Committee on Un-American Activities, I wish to express our thanks for your testimony today. You may be excused.

Mr. TAVENNER. The committee has information, Mr. Robinson, that in 1944 you were a member of a branch of the Communist Palty in Los Angeles. Is that correct?
Mr. RoBINsoN. I decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. On what grounds do you decline? Mi. ROBINSON. The fifth amendment, I guess.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 1 A subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities met, pursuant to call, at 10:10 a. m., in the chambers of Courtroom 9, United States Post Office and Courthouse Building, Hon. Donald L. Jackson (acting chairman), presiding. Committee member present: Representative Donald L. Jackson (acting chairman). Staff member present: William A. Wheeler, investigator.
Mr. JACKSON. The subcommittee will be in order.
Mr. Wheeler, will you call the witness.
Mr. WHEELER. Thomas M. McGrath.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. McGRATH. I do. TESTIMONY OF THOMAS MATTHEW McGRATH, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, WILLIAM B. ESTERMAN
Mr. WHEELER. Will the witness state his full name, please?
Mr. MCGRATH. Thomas McGrath, or with the middle name, Thomas Matthew McGrath.
Mr. WHEELER. Where do you presently reside?
Mr. MCGRATH. In the county of Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. Your present occupation ?
Mr. McGRATH. I am an assistant professor at Los Angeles State College.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you give us a brief r6sume of your educational background ?
Mr. McGRATH. Well, the first 8 years, I guess it is, the public school of Highland Township, I believe, District 69, if I am not mistaken, the county of Cass, in North Dakota. Following that, 4 years in high school, Sheldon High School, in the county of Ransom. Following that 4 years I took a B. A. at the University of North Dakota. 'Released by the committee on same day. 860 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA And following that, a year and a quarter semester-I have forgotten how it was called-at Louisiana State University, when I took a master of arts.
Mr. WHEELER. Approximately what year was that?
Mr McGRATH. Master of arts, 1939-40. Following that, 1 year at New College, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. That is about it.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you attend Oxford?
Mr MCGRATH. 1947-48. The year 1947-48.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you receive any type of scholarship at Oxford?
Mr. McGRATH. Yes, I received a Rhodes scholarship. I received that scholarship in-I was a Rhodes scholar-elect for 1939, if I am not mistaken, but I didn't go to Oxford until 1947, because in the fall of 1939 Rhodes scholars were forbidden to go to England because of the war. Then there was the war, and following the war I couldn't manage to get there until 1947.
Mr. WHEELER. When and where were you born ?
Mr. MCGRATH. When and where was I born?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Mr. MCGRATH. I was born November 20, 1916, in North Dakota.
Mr. WHEELER. What has your employment been since 1939?
Mr. McGRATH. Since 1939, let's see. It would have been since 1940, since that is the year I took my degree. I taught one year then at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, and following that I jobbed around at this and that, and went into the Army. I came out of the ArmyMr. WHEELER. Would you continue your employment from 1940 until you went to the Army?
Mr. McGRATH. From 1940 until I went into the Army, most of those jobs, I guess I can't remember. There are a couple I can't remember. Could I speak to you about this? (Witness addresses his counsel.)
Mr. ESTERMAN. Yes. (At this point Mr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. JACKSON. Let the record show at this point, pursuant to the authority vested in the chairman of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, he has appointed Mr. Jackson as a subcommittee of one to take testimony today.
Mr. ESTERMAN. What is the question? The employment record since 1940?
Mr. WHEELER. His employment, yes, since 1940, until he entered the United States Army.
Mr. ESTERMAN. Give them your best recollection.
Mr. MCGRATH. All right. I worked for a while, I don't know exactly how long, for a law firm of Stern and Pollett, I think it was, if I am not mistaken, or, Pollock, rather, in New York. Then I workedlMr.WHEELER. Approximately the dates?
Mr. McGRATH. Approximate dates, this would have been-I think it would have been straddling the end of 1940 and first part of 1941. And then later on I worked at Kearny Shipyards, Kearny, N. J.
Mr. WHEELER. That would have beenMr. McGRATH. From about March, or something of that sort, until 1 went into the Army, which was about-I am not certain of this. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 861 It was July or August, I believe. I remember I was going to get frozen into my job and I had the notion I wanted to be in the Army, so I quit the job and joined the Army.
Mr. VWIIEELER. When did you enter the United States Army?
Mr. McGRATI. I think it was something like August-it was the year of Pearl Harbor.
Mr. JACKSON. 1942? 
Mr. McGRATH. 1942.
Mr. ESTERMAN. Pearl Harbor was 1941.
Mr. JACKSON. Yes; December 7, 1941.
Mr. ESTERMAN. What was that date, August 1941?
Mr. MCGRATH. August 1941, I think.
Mr JACKSON. May I ask you at this time, are you represented by counsel ?
Mr. McGRATH. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Will counsel please identify himself for the record?
Mr. ESTERMAN. William B. Esterman.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you serve in the United States Army?
Mr. McGRATH. For 3 years and some odd months. I am not sure how many months; or 4.
Mr WHEELER. Were you honorably discharged?
Mr. MCGRATH. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. At what rank?
Mr. MCGRATH. Sergeant, buck sergeant.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you discharged?
Mr. McGRATH. I was discharged at Mitchel Field, Long Island.
Mr. WHEELER. After your discharge, what has your employment been?
Mr. MCGRATH. For the most part it was free-lance writing. I worked for, oh, I guess a couple of weeks or something like that, for the New York State Employment Service.
Mr. JACKSON. What was the nature of your writing?
Mr. MCGRATH. The nature of my writing?
Mr. JACKSON. Yes.
Mr. ESTERMAN. Just a minute. (At this point Mr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. MCGRATH. Could I have the legislative purpose of this question ?
Mr. JACKSON. In general, the legislative purpose of the question is to determine in general what type of writing and what publications you have written for, to determine whether or not it falls within the scope of this inquiry which is the extent and nature of Communist propaganda activities. (At this point Mr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. McGRATH. Do you have a particular publication in mind?
Mr. JACKSON. No; I have no particular publication in mind. I assume your writings were in the realm of public knowledge.
Mr. WHEELER. In January 1947 were youMr.
Mr.

Mr. JACKSON. Just a moment. ESTERMAN. Are you withdrawing the question? JACKSON. Is this on the same question ? WHEELER. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. No. I was inquiring from you as to what the nature of your writing had been. ( At this point Mr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.) 862 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. McGnATH. So far as I can see, this question has no legislative purpose.
Mr. JACKSON. Let me rephrase the question. Did you ever submit for publication any article or script to a publication known to you to be a Communist publication ? (At this point Mr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. McG(RATH. I decline to answer for the following reasons: After a dead serious consideration of the effects of this committee's work and of my relation to it, I find that for the following reasons I must refuse to cooperate with this body: In the first place, as a teacher, my first responsibility is to my students. To cooperate with this committee would be to set for them an example of accommodation to forces which can only have, as their end effect, the destruction of education itself. Such accommodation on my part would ruin my value as a teacher, and I am proud to say that a great majority of my students-and I believe this is true of students generally-do not want me to accommodate myself to this committee. In a certain sense, I have no choice in the matter-the students would not want me back in the classroom if I were to take any course of action other than the one I am pursuing. Secondly, as a teacher, I have a responsibility to the profession itself. We teachers have no professional oath of the sort that doctors take, but there is a kind of unwritten oath which we follow: To teach as honestly, fairly, and fully as we can. The effect of this committee is destructive of such an ideal, destructive of academic freedom. As
Mr. Justice Douglas has said: This system of spying and surveillance with its accompanying reports and trials cannot go hand in hand with academic freedom. It produces standardized thought, not the pursuit of truth. A teacher who will tack and turn with every shift of the political wind cannot be a good teacher. I have never done this myself, nor will I ever. In regard to my teaching I have tried to hold to two guidelines, the first from Chaucer that "gladly will I learn and gladly teach"; the second a paraphrase of the motto of the late General Stilwell "Illiterati non carborundum." Thirdly, as a poet, I must refuse to cooperate with the committee on what I can only call esthetic grounds. The view of life which we receive through the great works of art is a privileged one-it is a view of life according to probability or necehsity, not subject to the chance and accident of our real world and therefore in a sense truer than the life we see lived all around us. I believe that one of the things required of us is to try to give life an esthetic ground, to give it some of the pattern and beauty of art. I have tried as best I can to do this with my own life, and while I do not claim any very great success, it would be anticlimactic, destructive of the pattern of my life, if I were to cooperate with the committee. Then too, poets have been notorious noncooperators where committees of this sort are concerned. As a traditionalist, I would prefer to take my stand with Marvell, Blake, Shelley, and Garcia Lorca rather than with innovators like Mr. Jackson. I do not wish to bring dishonor upon my tribe. These, then, are reasons for refusing to cooperate, but I am aware that none of them is acceptable to the committee. When I was notified to appear here, my first instinct was simply to refuse to answer COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 863 committee questions out of personal principle and on the grounds of the rights of man and to let it go at that. On further consideration, however, I have come to feel that such a stand would be mere self-indulgence and that it would weaken the fight which other witnesses have made to protect the rights guaranteed under our Constitution. Therefore, I further refuse to answer to the committee on the grounds of the fourth amendment. I regard this committee as usurpers of illegal powers and my enforced appearance here as in the nature of unreasonable search and seizure. I further refuse on the grounds of the first amendment, which in guaranteeing free speech also guarantees my right to be silent. Although the first amendment expressly forbids any abridgement of this and other freedoms, the committee is illegally engaged in the establishment of a religion of fear. I cannot cooperate with it in this unconstitutional activity. Lastly, it is my duty to refuse to answer this committee, claiming my rights under the fifth amendment as a whole and in all its parts, and understanding that the fifth amendment was inserted in the Constitution to bulwark the first amendment against the activities of committees such as this one, so that no one may be forced to bear witness against himself.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you have any further questions?
Mr. WIIEELER. Yes, I do. Where are the Kearny Shipyards located?
Mr. McGiAT1H. Kearny, N. J.
Mr. WHIEELER. Were Voll a member of the shipyards branch of the Communist Party known as the Kearny Club ? (At this point Mr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. McGRATII. I decline to answer this question, and I incorporate all the reasons I have given in my declination.
Mr. WHEELER. How long have you lived in the city of Los Angeles?
Mr. McGRATH. Since about April. I believe, 1949.
Mr. WIIEELER. How long have you been a teacher at Los Angeles State College?
Mr. McGRATII. For 31/2 years; at the end of this year it will be 31/ years.
Mr. AYIIEELER. In 1951 were you a member of the John Reed division of the Los Angeles County Communist Party? (At this point IMr. McGrath conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. McGRATII. I decline to answer this question on the same grounds previously stated, incorporating them without repeating them.
Mr. 1WHEELER. During the first quarter of the year 1952 were you transferred from the John Reed division of the Communist Party to the eastern division of the Communist Party of the county of Los Angeles?
Mr. MCGRATH. I decline to answer on the same grounds previously given, and incorporate all my grounds as above.
Mr. WVIEELER. Are you a member of the Community Party today?
Mr. McGRATII. I decline to answer on the grounds previously given and incorporate my reasons.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions.
Mr. JACKSON. Is there any reason why the witness should not be excused?
Mr. WHEELER. NO. 864 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. JACKSUN. You are excused.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Wheeler, will you call the next witness?
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Matilda Lewis.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mrs. LEWIS. I do. TESTIMONY OF MATILDA LEWIS, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT W. KENNY
Mr. WHEELER. Will you please state your name ?
Mrs. LEWIs. Matilda Lewis.
Mr. IWHEELER.Where were you born?
Mrs. LEWIS. In Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. Where do you presently reside ?
Mrs. LEWIS. In Laguna Beach.
Mr. WHEELER. Your present occupation?
Mrs. LEWIs. As principal.
Mr. WHEELER. Of what school?
Mrs. LEris. Park Avenue School.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you briefly relate your educational background ?
Mrs. LEWIS. Yes: I went through the schools of Los Angeles, public schools, and went to UCLA and USC, Columbia University, and San Diego State College.
Mr. WHEELER. What year did you graduate from the San Diego State College?
Mrs. LEWIs. I didn't graduate from there. I worked; taking work at the present time off and on.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you graduateMrs. LEWIS. I graduated from Columbia University.
Mr. WHEELER. In what year?
Mrs. LEWIS. I think it was '35. I can't tell you exactly, but-no, '36. I think it was '36, the summer of '36.
Mr. WHEELER. How have you been employed since 1936?
Mrs. LEWIS. As a teacher.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you relate in which schools you taught?
Mrs. LEWIS. I taughtMr. WHEELER. Giving the approximate dates. Mi s. LEWis. I have done all my teaching in the Inglewood schools, except for the last 4 years.
Mr. WHEILER. Mrs. Lewis, are you acquainted with Leroy Herndon?
Mrs. LEWIs. I will not answer any questions pertaining to my former husband or pertaining to the time I was married to him. I therefore refuse to answer any question for the reasons previously stated. I have taken the Levering Act oath required of every teacher in this State. and if anyone has the courage to come forward in open couit to charge and prove I committed perjury, I am ready to defend myself before a jury of my fellow citizens. That is the American way. In the meantime I am entitled to the right of the presumption of innocence and not be compelled to give evidence against myself. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 865 All your pertinent questions, outside of the period of 1935-40, will be answered by me.
Mr. WHEELER. From what period of time?
Mrs. LEWIs. 1935-40.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you repeat the sentence in regard to the word "perjury," that contains the word "perjury"? 
Mrs. LEWIS. The sentence starts, "I have taken the Levering Act oath required of every teacher in this State, and if anyone has the courage to come forward in open court to charge and prove I committed perjury, I am ready to defend myself before a jury of my fellow citizens. That is the American way."
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Herndon testified under oath before this committee, during the recent hearings, he was a member of the Communist Party and a member of a teachers' unit in Los Angeles County. During the course of his testimony he stated that Matilda Lewis was also a member of this group. Is Mr. Herndon's testimony correct? (At this point Mrs. Lewis conferred with Mr. Kenny.)
Mrs. LEWIs. I decline to answer for the reasons already stated.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you acquainted with Anne Kinney, also known as Jane Howe?
Mrs. LEWIs. I refuse on the same reasons.
Mr. WHEELER. She testified in an executive statement on December 22, 1952, that she was also a member of the Communist Party and also assigned to the teachers' unit, the same group as Mr. Herndon, and she has testified under oath you were also a member of that group. Is that correct?
Mrs. LEWIS. I decline for the same reasons as stated before.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of local 430 of the American Federation of Teachers in Los Angeles ?
Mrs. LEWIS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. During what period of time?
Mrs. LEWIS. About 1936 or '37, I don't recall which, and up toI paid dues, I can't recall the exact date, but as close as I can remember, about 19-I don't know whether it was '47 or '48. I don't recall. I don't know, because I wasn't attending meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. What offices did you hold in this union?
Mrs. LEWIS. I was vice president for 1 year.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what year?
Mrs. LEWIS. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. I have an article from the Santa Ana Register dated July 14, 1948, with the heading "County Parties Are Organized." In this article it states that you were elected secretary of the Independent Progressive Party of Orange County. Are you the same Matilda Lewis referred to?
Mrs. LEWIS. Yes, I was interested in the Progressive Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1940?
Mrs. LEWIS. I said that I decline to answer between those years for the same reasons given.
Mr. WHEELER. Between what years, again ?
Mrs. LEWIs. 1935 to 1940.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1941? (At this point Mrs. Lewis conferred with Mr. Kenny.) 866 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs LEWIS. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party from 1941 to the present date?
Mrs. Lmvis. No.
Mr. JACKSON. During the period of time, Mrs. Lewis, that you were an officer in the American Federation of Teachers, did you have any personal knowledge of any efforts by the Communist Party to influence in any way the actions or the policy of the organization ? Ml s LEWIs. No; I didn't.
Mr WHEELER. I have no further questions.
Mr. JACKSON. Is there any reason why the witness should not be excused'
Mr. WnHEELER. None at all.

EXECUTIVE STATEMENT' An executive statement given at 1: 30 p. m. December 22, 1952, at room 1118, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. TESTIMONY OF ANNE KINNEY 2 
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state your full name 
Miss KINNEY. Anne Kinney. 1Mr. WHEELER. Where were you born ?
Miss KINNEY. Chicago. 
Mr. WHEELER. What has been your educational background?
Miss KINNEY. Well, I am a graduate of Chicago Normal College; now Chicago Teachers' College.
Mr. WHEELER. What has been your employment background?
Miss KINNEY. I taught for a year after I graduated from college. Later most of my employment was in clerical capacities. I worked as an inspector during the war.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you employed during the war ? 
Miss KINNEY. From 1942 to 1944 I worked for Studebaker Corp. in Chicago.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been employed since that time ?
Miss KINNEY. From the fall of 1944 until December of 1946, I worked for the United Office and Professional Workers. Since then I have had temporary jobs of maybe 2 to 4 weeks' duration, 3 or 4 of those.
Mr. WHEELER. Where do you presently reside?
Miss KINNEY. Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; I was.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you join the Communist Party ?
Mr. KINNEY. August 1933.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been known by any other name ?
Miss KINNEY. I was Jane Howe. 2SReleased by the committee Anne Kinney was sworn in as a witness by the court reporter. 868 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Was this a Commulnist Party name?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr WHEELER. For what purpose did you use the name Jane Howe?
Miss KINNEY. Principally as a means of protecting the person with whom I was living at the time I joined. It was common practice for people to use a different name in the party.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the reasons for your becoming a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Like many people, I was appalled by what happened during the depression, by the conditions under which people were forced to live. Being both idealistic and without any knowledge of political science or economics, I was easily convinced that Marxism was the answer. When the Socialist Party seemed to be doing nothing that was effective, I began to wonder if perhaps the Communist Party was where I would find more immediate activity. I did some reading in the public library which led me to believe that they and not the Socialists were following Marxist principles. Therefore, in August 1933, I applied for membership by going to the county office and asking to join.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you recruited by any specific person ?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. After becoming a member of the Communist Party, to what branches were you assigned?
Miss KINNEY. First to a neighborhood branch.
Mr. WHEELER. You correct me if I am wrong about this. I understand that from October 1933 to February 1934 there was a special group within the Socialist Party.
Miss KINNEY. I had forgotten about that.
Mr. WHEELER. February 1934 to May 1934, Hollywood street group. May 1934 to September 1934, a Burbank street group. From September 1934 to the fall of 1935, a member at large.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. The fall of 1935 to December 1938, a teachers' unit. December 1938 to August 1939, 56th assembly district, which is in the 13th Congressional District.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. From August 1939 to the fall of 1940, section organizer, 15th Congressional District. The fall of 1940 to May 1942, working on the county membership commission, organizer of the 65th assembly district, and for a short period of time county membership director.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. From May 1942 to the summer or fall of 1944, a Studebaker plant unit in Chicago.
Miss KINNEY. Just a minute. There is actually a gap of a few months there, while I was in transit, so to speak.
Mr. WHEELER. We will explain that when we cover each group.
Miss KINNEY. I was going from here to there.
Mr. WHEELER. Transferred. That can be clarified.
Miss KINNEY. That covers almost 6 months.
Mr. WHEELER. From the fall of 1944 to the fall of 1945, the Hyde Park branch in Chicago, a street unit. Is that correct?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 869 
Mr. WHEELER. Have you reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation what knowledge you have of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; I have.
Mr. WHEELER. When and to what office did you give your infor- mation ?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was March 1951, in Phoenix.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the members of the Communist Party assigned to the Socialist branch?
Miss KINNEY. I remember Harold and Mildred Ashe, John Spears, Marjorie Hay.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you describe a little more fully each individual?
Miss KINNEY. Harold Ashe was at that time State secretary of the Socialist Party. John Spears was unemployed. Marjorie Hay was teaching in the Los Angeles city schools. All were members of the Socialist Party at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you given any instructions by any member of the Communist Party as to your activity within the Socialist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you explain your answer more fully?
Miss KINnEY. Well, I don't remember now too well, except we were supposed to build up this rank and file group, which was sort of an opposition group to the State leadership.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the members of this Communist Party unit within the Socialist Party have anything to do to disrupt the normal proceedings of the Socialist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Well, I think the group tried.
Mr. WHEELER. Did they have any success? 
Miss KINNEY. To a certain extent, yes. There were perhaps 3 locals of the Socialist Party that withdrew. Two of them, I think, turned into unemployed organizations, and I think the third one may have become a branch of the American League Against War and Fascism.
Mr. WHEELER. How was this accomplished? 
Miss KINNEY. At this point I really couldn't tell you.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you identify the members of the Hollywood street branch to which you were assigned ?
Miss KINNEY. I think the only one I remember is Dr. Tashjian.1
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals comprised the Hollywood branch?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were about 10.
Mr. WHEELER. Then you recall no additional individuals at this time ?
Miss KIN-EY. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. You testified that you were a member of a street branch in Burbank from approximately September 1934 to the fall of 1943. Can you identify the members of the Burbank group?
Miss KINNEY. Bill and Nina Ingham, Albert Lockett. That is all I can remember now.
Mr. WIEELER. How many individuals comprised this group?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were just about 7 or 8. 
Mr. WHEELER. From September 1934 to the fall of 1935, you stated you were a member at large. What is meant by the term "member at large?" SDr Vaughan A K Tashjian 870 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. You are not attached to any branch of any sort.
Mr. WHEELER. For what reason ?
Miss KINNEY. Because I was given a special assignment.
Mr. WHEELER. In your opinion, would you say that you were a member at large and not assigned to any group because of security reasons of the party ?
Miss KINNEY. I presume so.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to any particular person?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, to Harrison George.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you further identify Mr. Harrison George?
Miss KINNEY. Harrison George was apparently carrying out some special assignment which had to do with publishing what I think ,-as a trade-union paper that was sent to Japan. I knew very little about it, because all I was supposed to do was pick up mail for him that was sent to various addresses and take it to him.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall from whom you picked up the mail?
Miss KINNEY. NO, I don't. I never made the arrangements for the use of the addresses. I simply went and got the envelopes and took them to George.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the addresses where you picked up the envelopes?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at any time acquire any knowledge as to what the envelopes contained'
Miss KINNEY. No, I didn't, nor did I ever know where they came from. 
Mr. WHEELER. When assigned to Harrison George, did you at any time have any knowledge of a branch of the party known as the Philippine committee?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. IWIIEELER. According to your testimony, you were assigned to a teachers' unit from the fall of 1935 to December 1938. Who were the members of this group ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember when they came in, with rare exceptions. 
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the members of this group during the time you were a member?
Miss KINNEY. Marjorie Hay, who was teaching in the Los Angeles schools. Harry Shepro. I think you should assume that, unless I mention anything to the contrary, all of them were in the city schools.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Mis KIN-NEY. Sam Wixman. I think his wife was a member. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her first name?
Miss KINNEY. No. Norman Byrne.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall a member of this unit by the name of Honor Moxley Carey ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall whether or not you recruited this individual?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I did. She subsequently dropped out, I think, probably about 1937, but I am not sure exactly when. I do know she did drop out. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 871 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how long she was a member of this group?
Miss KINNEYI. No, I am not sure. There was Beulah Wales, who was a member only for the first few months.
Mr. WIHEELER. Was Rose Posell a member of this unit?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr WHEELER. WaS she still a member when you left the teachers' group?
Miss KINNEY. So far as I can recall. There were two teachers from Glendale, Dick Lewis and LeRoy Herndon.
Mr. WHEELER. Dick Lewis, would that be Richard B. Lewis.
Miss KINNEY. It is Richard; I don't know his middle initial.
Mr. WHEELER. How long was Mr. Lewis in this group, do you recall
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember exactly when he joined. He still was a member at the time I left.
Mr. TWHEELER. Was Mr. Herndon also a member at the time you left the teachers' unit?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WIHEELER. Do you recall Abe Minkus? 
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he a member of this group ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; he was.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Zara Becker?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Ruth Stoddard Ryan?
Miss KINNEY. Ruth Ryan was a member. She was not in the city schools. I am not sure whether she was teaching in the nursery school at that time or whether she had in the past. Becky Goodman was also a member. She was a nursery school teacher. I am not sure she was teaching then.
Mr. WHIEELER. Was Angelina Riskin a member of the Communist Party'
Miss KINNEY. Yes. /
Mr. WTHEELER. Was Brodia Most a member of this teachers' unit
Miss KINNEY. I think so.
Mr. W HEELER. Were you acquainted with Davida Franchia?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; but she wasn't a member of the teachers' unit.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what group she was a member of?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. However, you did meet her as a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER. member ?
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER. you were in ? Yes. WaS Al Lewis a member of the teachers' unit? Yes. Do you recall if his wife, Matilda Lewis, was a Yes; she was. Are you acquainted with Frank Oppenheimer? Yes. Was he a member of the Communist Party ? Yes; in Pasadena.
Mr. Oppenheimer was not a member of the group 872 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the occasion you met him as a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. It was at some meeting in connection with the professional section.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that meeting be termed as a fraction meeting ? Mis KINNEY. No; it was not a section meeting. It may have been a meeting of branch organizers in that section, something of that sort.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever have the occasion to meet any other teachers who were members of the Communist Party from the Pasadena section
Miss KINNEY., I don't think there were any teachers. Oppenheimer, as I recall, was a research assistant, or something like that, at Caltech.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals were members of this group, the total amount of people going in and being transferred and quitting ? What would your estimate be? Niss KIXXNEY I would imagine there would have been maybe 25. That is allowing for a few I undoubtedly have forgotten about.
Mr. WHEELER. When I interviewed you the first time, you mentioned a teacher whose first name was Claire. Do you recall the last name?
Miss KINsEY. No.
Mr. WTHEELEE. Were you a nember of local 430, American Federation of Teachers?
Miss KIN-NE . Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When was local 430 organized?
Miss KINNEY. Fall of 1935.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at any time hold an office in local 430?
Miss KIxNEY. Yes; I was recording secretary for a year, almost a year.
Mr. WEELER. Do you recall what year?
Miss KI-NET. I think the fall of 1938.
Mr WHEELER. Did any of the individuals you mentioned, members of the Communist Party, hold any office in local 430 ?
Miss KINNETY. At one time or another Harry Shepro and Marjorie Hay, and I think Sam Wixman, held office. I am not sure whether any of the others did or not.
Mr. WHEELER. In your opinion, did the Communist Party control local 430?
Miss KIXNEX-. I would say it exerted considerable influence. Mi. WHEELER. What was the party's main objective in bringing teachers to the Communist Party?
Miss KIXNEr. It may have been the intention of higher party authorities to exert influence on the teachers and thereby on the material they taught, and the way in which they repeated it to the children. In practice. I don't think it worked out to any great extent. At least, during the time I was in the teachers' branch, there never was any discussion of what doctrines we taught and what we did with it.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you employed as a teacher ?
Miss KINNEY. No; I wasn't.
Mr. WIEELER. Did member teachers have meetings prior to regular meetings in local,430 to discuss what course of action was to be taken by the Communist fraction in real meetings ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 873 
Miss KINNEY. Subjects of that nature were discussed in them.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any specific problems that were discussed prior to union meetings?
Miss KINNEY. Largely the question of building up the union membership. The teachers would hold meetings prior to regular meetings and at times-one problem was to keep some of the non-Communist teachers, union members, from being busier "saving the world" than they were on the problems facing the teachers in Los Angeles. The Communists were anxious to build up the union as a stronger force among the teachers in Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the approximate membership of local 430 ?
Miss KINNEY. I have forgotten.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you say 100
Miss KIxNEY. No: it was over that. I don't remember whether it was close to 200 or just what it was.
Mr. WHEELER. Were all the teachers you mentioned as members of the Communist Party also members of local 430?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. On what percentage of votes could the Communist Party depend on, on any given subject, which reflected the Communist Party line?
Miss KINNEY. There were, as I recall, no issues on which there was any sharp fight. The situation in the thirties was different than it is now, and as a rule there was no particular opposition to any proposals which Communists in the hearings might have made.
Mr. WHEELER. Was a Communist teacher given any particular instructions regarding indoctrination of students?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Would a Communist teacher in class discussion ever take an anti-Soviet attitude ?
Miss KINNEY. I doubt that they would.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you believe a Communist teacher is a suitable person to educate the students of this country?
Miss KINNEY. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. Why?
Miss KINNEY. Because I don't think their first loyalty is to the welfare of this country.
Mr. WHEELER. To what country would you say they owe their allegiance?
Miss KINNEY. To Russia.
Mr. WHEELER. On what do you base this answer?
Miss KINNEY. The fact that all during the time I was in the party it was considered the Soviet Union could do no wrong.
Mr. WHEELER. During the time you were a member of the Communist Party, did you place your allegiance to the Soviet Union above that of the United States?
Miss KINNEY. I wouldn't say that I did, because I felt that there wasn't a contradiction. I, of course, no longer feel that way.
Mr. WHEELER. How many branches of the American Federation of Teachers were there in California ?
Miss KINNEY. I think six.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were these locals located? 31747-53-pt. 5-3 874 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY1.I can remember there were locals in Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, and Los Angeles. I am not sure about Sacramento.
Mr. WHEELER. Were there any members of the Communist Party in the locals which you have mentioned?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were in San Diego, in Oakland.
Mr. W-HEELER. Did you ever attend a Communist fraction meeting comprised of representatives of the various locals? Nlis. KINNEY. Yes. It didn't include people from all the locals. 1 left one out, incidentally. There was one in Palo Alto.
Mr. Win l.LER. Where was this fraction meeting held? 
Miss Kixx.. Somewhere in Palo Alto, previous to a State convention of the American Federation of Teachers.
Mr. WVHEELER. Do you remember how many individuals attended this meeting?
Miss KINNEY. NO. I got very ill in the middle of that convention and I spent a lot of the time in bed, in the hotel, and I don't remember.
Mr. VWHIEELER. Well, do you recall any of the teachers who attended this Communist fraction meeting
Miss KINNEY. There were two teachers from Oakland whose names I don't remember. Dr. Holland Robert, in Palo Alto. I think Harry Steinmetz, from San Diego. 
Mr. WIIEELER. Did you ever meet Harry Steinmetz on any other occasion? 
Miss KINNEY. I think he came to our house one time. I know he calme to our house at one time. 
Mr. WhIEELER. You are certain lie was a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, he was; he was at that fraction meeting. Pre- sumably he was or lie wouldn't have been at the meeting.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who attended the meeting ?
Miss KINNEY. No; I don't even remember who else from Los Angeles was there.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what was discussed?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. You have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any other teachers than the ones previously identified ?
Miss KINNEY. I was told there was a teacher in San Francisco, but I don't remember the name, if I ever knew it.
Mr. WHEELER. You don't recall anyone else at this time?
Miss KINNEY No. 
Mr. WIIEELER. Do you have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any present or former member of the Los Angeles City Board of Education?
Miss KINNEY. The board of education?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Miss KINNEY Oh, no. iMr. 7TIIEELER. What is your answer regarding the Los Angeles county y Board of Education?
Miss KINXNY. I don't think I have ever even known who was on the county board of education.
Mr. WIEELER. Do you have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any present or former member of the State board of education ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 875 
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Were any members or employees of the city, county, or State boards of education considered to be friends or individuals who would be trusted by the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Not so far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any present or former employee of the city, county, or State boards of education? I don't mean the teachers. I mean the actual people employed by the city and county and State boards to actually help the board members
Miss KINNEY. I don't know that I remember anything about it.
Mr. WHEELER. Were yol ever a member of the disciplinary colmmittee of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I have been a member of a committee that acted as a disciplinary committee. It was a committee appointed by the 13th congressional section. As for the county disciplinary committee, I never was a member of it.
Mr. ~VIIEELER. For what purpose was this committee set up?
Miss KINNEY. You mean the one in the 13th congressional district?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. Well, there were two members of a branch, whose names I don't recall, who had done something, I don't recall what, and it was felt they should be called in and questioned. Who they were, I don't know, or about what. Nor do I remember what final action the committee took.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you recall the members of this committee?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at any time prefer charges against any member of the Communist Party which resulted in a hearing before a disciplinary committee ?
Miss KINNEY. Well, the teachers' branch acted, as a whole, as a disciplinary committee, so far as Sam Wixman was concerned.
Mr. WHEILER. Did you prefer the charges against Sam Wlxman?
Miss KINNEY. Well, in the sense the charges were preferred; yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the nature of the charges, do you recall?
Miss KINNEY. In general, disruption, but I don't remember anything specific.
Mr. WHEELER. Where was the meeting held ? 
Miss KINNEY. It was a regular teachers' branch meeting. I mean, we met at various teachers' homes, and I don't remember at what particular homes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was present at this meeting?
Miss KINNEY. Harry Shepro, Marjorle Hay, Honor6 Moxley Carey, Mildred' Wixman.
Mr. WHEELER. Would her name be Myrtle ?
Miss KINNEY. Myrtle, yes.
Mr. WHIEELER. You recall her name as Myrtle? 
Miss KINxlN-. Yes, it is Myrtle. I don't remember who all was there. The whole branch membership was there, whoever the members at that time were. But I don't recall exactly.
Mr. YWHEELER. Do you recall who the witnesses were?
Miss KINNEY. It wasn't conducted in such a formal manner, as to have witnesses. We discussed Wixman's actions at great length.
Mr. WHEELER. tWas WXlxman present to defend himself? SName corrected to be Myrtle 876 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES ARhA 
Miss KINNEY. We had two meetings on this. He was present at the first one. As I recall, he refused to come to the second.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what his position was at the first meeting?
Miss KINNEY. Well, he of course maintained he hadn't been disrupting. He maintained that position at considerable length, but I couldn't give any details.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the approximate date of this disciplinary hearing?
Miss KINNEY. I would guess it was about January 1937.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the result ?
Miss KINNEY. The branch voted that he be expelled.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Wixman so notified?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I think so.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Wixman ever permitted to rejoin the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Not that I know of.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall when Wixman lost his teaching position in June 1940 ?
Miss KINNEY. I heard that he had.
Mr. WHEELER. Did not the Communist Party attempt to assist Wixman in regaining his employment?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the Classroom Teachers' Federation?
Miss KINNEY. I knew there was such an organization, which had been in existence a long time.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know the background of the organization, a little information as to when it was started and what the purpose was?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know when it was started. The people that started the Classroom Teachers' Federation felt the teachers' organizations were not doing enough to look after the interests of the classroom teachers and were to a great extent influenced by the principles.
Mr. WHEELER. Were the teachers you have identified as members of the Communist Party also members of the Classroom Teachers' Federation?
Miss KINNEY. I think some of them were.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Teachers' Federation support Wixman in his difficulty with the board of education?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. From December 1938 to August 1939, you have testified that you were a member of the 56th-assembly-district branch of the 13th Congressional District, is that correct?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any official position ?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember any of the members of this group ? 
Miss KINNEY. The chairman of the branch was called Ann. Lew Scott was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you further identify Lew Scott?
Miss KINNEY. I can't. I don't know what he did.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you transferred to the 56th assembly branch for any specific reason? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 877 
Miss KINNEY. Lew Scott was causing some difficulty in the branch and I was assigned there, shall we say, to keep him from becoming too influential, because it was felt by many people he was perhaps, as we called it an unreliable element.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of this unit ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't; no.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified that from August 1939 to the fall of 1940 you were a section organizer of the 15th Congressional District. What were your duties?
Miss KINNEY. Well, in general, I was held responsible for the proper functioning and activity of the branches making up the 15th Congressional District section.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you estimate the approximate membership of the 15th Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were about 150 members.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the publication Two Decades of Progress?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. I will ask you if that document was an official publication of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was supposed to be.
Mr. WHEELER. For identification, the cover reads: "Two Decades of Progress, Communist Party, L. A. County, 1919-39." The back cover discloses the document was printed by the Dependable Printers, 2510 Brooklyn Avenue. I will ask you to look at page 30 of the document, or, the book, rather, and state whether or not the photograph appearing on that page is yours.
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Will you read the entire page into the record?
Miss KINNEY (reading) : Fifteenth Congressional District, room 213, 3950 West Sixth Street, FA. 9552. Jane Howe, Organizer. From Hollywood Boulevard to Slauson, from Fairfax to Hoover Street, the 15th Congressional District is typical of Los Angeles. The workers in the closeto-billion-dollar motion-picture industry, fighting for honest, democratic trade unionism; the unemployed, fighting for jobs and adequate relief, the smallbusiness men, struggling to keep from being squeezed out; these are the people who, along with the Negro and Japanese people who live in the district, have begun to come together in a movement for progressive government. The election of four progressive councilmen-Nelson, Benett, Briggs, and Rasmussen-is an indication of the possibility of ousting the present Tory Democrat, Congressman Costello, in 1940. Since 1934, with the first fight for free speech in Hollywood, the Communist Party has been an important factor in every struggle of the people. The studio strikers of 1937, the Hollywood Citizen-News pickets of 1938, the Workers' Alliance, Labor's Nonpartisan League, Ham and Eggers have all seen the party in action, helping in every progressive movement Their appreciation was shown in the large vote given Emil Freed, Communist candidate for Congress in 1938. 57th assembly district: East branch, Emil Freed. president, 1505 North Western Avenue West branch, Jack Ginsberg, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Day branch, J. Caroway, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Hans Eisler branch, M. Morris, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Hollywood Studio, Milton Henry, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Newspaper branch, Peter Steel, president, 3950 West Sixth Street 878 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 58th assembly district Wilshire branch, Libby Jacobson, president, 3084 San Marino Street Japanese branch, John Matsuto, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Lawyers' branch, Lawrence West, president, 3950 West Sixth Street 63d assembly district: 63d assembly-district branch, Sara Kusnitz, president, 2180 West Twentyninth Street Culver City Studio, Frank Oats, president, 3950 West Sixth Street 65th assembly district: Anya Lieberson, president, 1240 West Fortieth Place
Mr. WHEELER. Do yOU recall writing what you have just read? 
Miss KINNEY. I don't know whether I wrote it or Emil Freed wrote it.
Mr. WHEELER. In your position as organizer, would you have approved it?
Miss KIXNEY. I would have approved it.
Mr. WHIEELER. Were any of the councilmen mentioned on this page members of the Communist Party?
Miss KIXNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. What part did you, as organizer of the 15th Congressional District, or the Communist Party have in the "first fight for free speech in Hollywood"?
Miss KI NEY. I don't know what they mean by the "'irstfight for free speech in Hollywood" in 1939. I have no recollection of it.
Mr. WHIEELER. To quote from this page: The studio strikers of 1937, the Hollywood Citizen-News pickets of 1938, the Workers' Alliance, Labor's Nonpartisan League, Ham and Eggers have all seen the party in action. What part did the Communist Party take in the studio strike of 193 ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you take any part in it?
Miss KINNEY. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. What part did the party take in the Workers' Alliance?
Miss KINNEY. I presume that some party members were members of the Workers' Alliance and probably helped to establish branches of the Workers' Alliance. I don't know. At the time that this publication appeared, I had only been section organizer for about 3 weeks in this section.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Workers' Alliance?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever employed by the Workers' Alliance?
Miss KINNEY. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you consider the Workers' Alliance a front for the Communist Party? 
Miss KINNEY. To a certain extent, I think it was. To a certain extent, I think it was a legitimate organization that probably was able to do something for the unemployed; what they would not have been able to do without an organization.
Mr. WHEELER. You have mentioned in your testimony that the Communist Party may have been insti mental in assisting in setting up branches of the Workers' Alliance, isn't that correct?
Miss KINNET. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 879 
Mr. WHEELER. The Communist Party certainly wouldn't lend their assistance to organizations unless the organizations were in sympathy with the objectives of the party, would they ? The Communist Party wouldn't assist in setting up a branch of the German-American Bund?
Miss KINNE. No. What I mean by my previous answer is this: The party may have had definite ideas about what it hoped to accomplish for the Workers' Alliance, but I think that at the same time some good things were accomplished for the unemployed. Do you understand the distinction I am trying to make?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. I don't feel that you can condemn the Workers' Alliance outright and say everything they did was bad. I think they did a lot of things that were better left undone.
Mr. WHEELER. I don't think you can say that the Communist Party is all bad. I think there is some agreement in some of their objectives that perhaps most American citizens do agree with.
Miss KINNET. The objectives on top, the public objectives are perhaps some things with which yon can agree.
Mr. WIIEEL:R. I think we all agree with slum clearance.
Miss KINNEY. The party, I think, has always followed a practice of trying to pick , public objective that many people are in agreement with.
Mr. WHEELER. Getting back to page 30 again, what part did the party take in the Labor's Non-Partisan League?
Miss KINNEY. I think some party members were members of the Labor's Non-Partisan League.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say that the Labor's Non-Partisan League was in the same category as Workers' Alliance, so far as your description of Workers' Alliance goes?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was probably lessMr. WHELLER. Infiltrated?
Miss KIN-NEY. Influenced by the party. I think that the Labor's Non-Partisan League was less influenced by the party.
Mr. WHELLER. According to page 30 of this document, a number of Communist Party branches were in your district. The first listed is the east branch of the 57th Assembly District. Emil Freed is listed as president. Do you know Emil Freed as a Communist and president of the East Branch?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall any other members in that branch?
Miss KINNEY. His wife was a member.
Mr . WHELLER. Do you recall her given name? 
Miss KINNEY. Tassia.
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall anyone else?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't
Mr. WHELLER. What type of branch was the East Branch? 
Miss KINNEY. A street branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Who maintained the membership records for the 15th 'Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. It would be the section membership director, and I -don't remember who it was.
Mr. WHELLER. Who was section treasurer?
Miss KINNEY. Tassia Freed. 880 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall the approximate amount of moneys collected per month as dues?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall what percentage of the money taken in as dues was retained by the section and what part went to the Los Angeles County organization?
Miss KINNEY. I used to know all those things. I think the section kept 10 percent. How much the branches kept and how much went to the county, I don't remember.
Mr. WHELLER. Who appointed you section organizer?
Miss KINNLI. I was elected by the section committee on the proposal of the-proposed to them, I believe, by the county committee or by the county organizer.
Mr. WHELLER. The county organizer at that time was Max Silver?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember whether it was Max Silver or Paul Cline.
Mr. WHELLER. The second branch listed in the document "2 Decades of Progress" is the West Branch. What can you tell us about this unit?
Miss KINNEY. It was also a street branch. Aside from Jack Ginsberg, who is listed as president, his wife Margaret was a member. I believe Fanya Friedman was a member. I don't remember anybody else.
Mr. WHELLER. The next branch listed is a day branch, 57th Assembly District, with J. Caroway listed as president. What do you remember about this branch?
Miss KINNEY. Not a thing.
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall J. Caroway ? 
Miss KINNEY. No. I am not sure whether it was supposed to be housewives or whether it was people who worked at night.
Mr. WHEELER. The next branch listed in the document is the Hans Eisler Branch, 75th Assembly District What type of branch was the Eisler Branch?
Miss KINNEY. The branch listed as the Eisler Branch, was a branch of musicians.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the head of this branch was?
Miss KINNEY. Miriam Brooks.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the members?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. How do branches acquire the names?
Miss KINNEY. The branch chooses the name. If it chooses the name of a person dead or alive, it is somebody whom they feel may not necessarily have been or be a Communist, but represents principles which the Communists support. I know of one branch named Thomas Masaryk, who I believe was the first president of Czechoslovakia. What I am trying to say is that because a branch is named for a person doesn't necessarily mean that person is or was a Communist.
Mr. WHEELER. It doesn't mean he is anti-Communist, does it?
Miss KINNEY. Certainly wouldn't be anti-Communist. That is, if it were someone who is alive. Someone dead, you can assume the party may assume he might have been pro-Communist; other people may have had their doubts. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 881 
Mr. WIIEELER. We had testimony in 1945 in regard to this matter we are discussing. The witness said that they would never name a branch of the Communist Party after a live Communist because of the fact that he may be driven out of the party and turn against them. I am somewhat surprised a Hans Eisler branch appears, which is named after a man who is currently alive.
Miss KINNEY. I think there have been instances when branches have been named for live Communists, and I believe there have been embarrassing consequences sometimes, too.
Mr. WHEELER. This procedure probably started after Eisler's branch was set up. The next branch entered in the document "2 Decades of Progress" is a Hollywood branch. What knowledge do you have concerning this branch ?
Miss KINNEY. The members were workers in the studios, in the crafts, that is, carpenters, painters, electricians, and so on.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the head of this branch?
Miss KINNEY. It says here Milton Henry, which doesn't mean a thing. John Bevins Was the head of that branch, so far as I remember.
Mr. WHEELER. How was Mr. Bevins employed?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember what John was doing at that time. I don't know whether lie was working in the studios then or not. I know he had in the past, one time.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall that John Bevins was his true name or a party name?
Miss KINNEY. John Bevins was the name I knew him by. It may have been a party name.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall whether or not he was also known as Jacob Levine ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet a Jacob Levine in the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. No, not that I recall.
Mr. nTTIEELER. The next branch listed is the newspaper branch. It tells who was head of the newspaper branch.
Miss KINNEY. I ani not sure who was head of the newspaper branch. I know that Sid Burke was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Peter Steel is listed in the document as president. Do you recall Peter Steel?
Miss KINNEY. Not by that name.
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, Peter Steel is a party name and is actually Charles Judson, who testified as a cooperative witness in Washington last year. Did you know Charles Judson?
Miss KINNEY. I think so.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else were members?
Miss KINNEY I think Tom Cullen was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else do you remember?
Miss KINNEY. Ed Robbins,'Herb Klein, Brick Garrigues; I don't remember Brick's real first name. I know him as Brick. I know that at one time Jay Moss and Dolph Winebrenner and Urcel Daniel were members, but I don't remember whether it was at this particular time or not. 1 According to information received by the committee, the full name of this individual is Charles H. Garnrgues 882 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Were all these individuals connected with the newspaper business
Miss KINNEY. So far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, Urcel Daniel testified as a cooperative witness in Washington in 1952. Do you recall if George Shaffer was a member of this group?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Minna Klein a member of this group, also? 
Miss KINNEY. I don't know. I know she was a member of the party.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if William E. Oliver was a member of this group ?
Miss KINNEY. I am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Mr. Oliver as a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I think I have heard the name, but I don't recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Lillian Jones?
Miss KINNEY. Lillian Jones
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if Lillian Jones was a member of the newspaper branch?
Miss KINNEY. Not so far as I know. She, I think, was a member of that branch in Hollywood that I was in, in 1934.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know her occupation?
Miss KINNEY. She was secretary of the workers' school at the time I knew her, I believe.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she employed in the film industry ?
Miss KINNEY. Not as far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. "2 Decades of Progress," page 30, also discloses that the 58th Assembly District was in the 15th Congressional District. According to this document the 58th Assembly District contained three Communist Party branches, the first being the Wilshire branch. What type of branch was the Wilshire branch'
Miss KINNEY. That was a street branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anything about the Wilshire branch?
Miss KINNEY. Libby Jacobson was the chairman of the branch. Emily and Julian Gordon were members of it.
Mr. WHEELER. The second group listed within the 58th Assembly District is a Japanese group. What knowledge do yo have regarding this group?
Miss KINNEY. There was a small group of Japanese and it was my impression they were all Japanese gardeners; none of them spoke English. The president of the branch I knew only as George. I don't know his last name. He spoke very little English.
Mr. WHEELER. The third branch listed within the 58th Assembly District is a lawyers branch. What can you tell us about this branch?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember this Lawrence West, who is listed as president. I believe Jack Franko was a member of that branch. I must have known other members at the time, but I don't remember now.
Mr. WHEELER. I would like to refer to volume III of executive hearings of July 17, 18, 19, 22, 26; August 5, 6, 16, 17, 19 and 20, 1940, of hearings before Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 76th Congress. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 883 On page 1239 of this document, I read the following: Carey McWilliams, state housing commissioner Jane Howe, former professional section membership director, gave me his name as the one to contact to make arrangements for my appearance at the Communist Party's lawyers' unit. The Communist Party unit is synonymous with the lawyers guild faction. This is the testimony of a person, a former member of the Communist Party, who appeared before the committee in 1940, and testified to what I have just read.
Miss KINNEY. That I told them to contact Carey McWilliams?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. I never would have, because to my knowledge Carey McWilliams was never a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Carey McWilhams?
Miss KINNEY I met him once.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the occasion?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. It was at a time when he and a group of others, whom I do not remember, were planning a conference in connection with the foreign born, and I think it was alien registration. I went to his office. I think he was State housing commissioner at that time. I went to his office in my capacity as section organizer for the 15th Congressional District, to offer him the help of our section in organizing this group.
Mr.WIEELER. You identified yourself to him as an organizer of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. What was his reaction ?
Miss KINNEY. He was very polite and noncommittal. He said he would be glad to have help from anybody that was concerned about these things but did not make any specific suggestions as to what our section of the Communist Party could do.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you sent there by someone else in the party?
Miss KINNEY. Our section committee decided this would be a good idea. Nothing came of it. I mean we didn't really do anything to help the conference.
Mr. WHEELER. Did your section committee consider Carey McWilliams as sympathetic to the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Not particularly. Carey McWilliams, I think they considered him as a progressive member of Governor Olsen's administration. This was a case of the party trying to horn in on something.
Mr. WHEELER. "Two Decades of Progress" reflects that the 63d assembly district was also in the 15th Congressional District. Two branches of the Communist Party, according to this document, were in this assembly district, the 63d Assembly District Branch and the Culver City Studio Branch. What can you tell the committee of the first branch
Miss KINNEY. Sara Kusnetz was a chairman of the branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the members of the branch? What type of branch was that?
Miss KINNEY. It was a street branch, and so far as this Culver City Studio Branch is concerned, I have absolutely no recollection of the existence of such a branch.
Mr. WHEELER. The last branch was in the 15th Congressional District, as recorded in "Two Decades of Progress" and was the 65th assembly district. Will you describe this branch 884 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. This was a small street branch. Anya Lieberson was president. Her husband, Eddie Fisher, was a member of that branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you further identify Eddie Fisher ?
Miss KINNEY. No. I think he worked as a salesman. I don't know what he sold.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of the 15th Congressional District? Do you recall if Joseph Zadow was a member?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, he was in the 58th assembly.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall his occupation?
Miss Kinney. He was a tailor.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Sanders Sheff?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know whether he belonged to the 63d or the 65th assembly district. He is an engineer; I don't know what kind of engineer.

Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who he married ?

Miss KINNEY. Yes. I previously mentioned her as a member of the west branch of the 56th assembly district.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if Ernest Dawson was a member of the Communist Party in the 15th Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. Not that I know of.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any person by the name of Dawson that owned a bookstore ?
Miss KINNEY. I know a person in Los Angeles by the name of Ernest Dawson that owned a bookstore, but he was not a member of the Communist Party, so far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else in the 15th Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you acquainted with the unit in the Communist Party comprised of social workers?
Miss KINNEY. I knew some social workers. There were, I think, two units of social workers in the professional section.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any of these people ? The other day in our interview you mentioned you knew Betty Selden as a member of the Communist Party.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Ruth Ober as a member of the Communist Party?

Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he a member of the Communist Party?

Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you a member ?
Miss KINNEY. Here in Los Angeles, in the fall of 1940, until the fall of 1941; I never attended a meeting.

Mr. WHEELER. IS Bert Stone male or female ?
Miss KINNEY. Female.
Mr. WHEELER. You previously testified that you were employed by the United Office and Professional Workers of America in Chicago. Were you active at all as a Communist in that organization? Mliss KINNEY. Well, I was still a Communist at the time I started working for them. I had dropped out of the party before I stopped working for them.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know anyone in Chicago connected with the United Office and Professional Workers of America to be a Communist?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, there were some members of the union whom I knew to be Communists.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this knowledge based upon party meetings?
Miss KINNEY. In the case of one, yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was that one?
Miss KINNEY. Joan Place.
Mr. WHEELER. What do you base your knowledge on, the other individuals whom you know to be members of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Evelyn Keller said she was.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she employed by the UOWPA ?
Miss KINNEY. Evelyn Keller was clerical worker in the union office in Chicago.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there anyone connected with the UOWPA in Chicago a Communist?
Miss KINNEY. There were, I think, several members whom I assumed were Communists, although I didn't necessarily see them at meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, we will not go into that. How did you obtain your job with United Office and Professional Workers of America?
Miss KINNEY. I heard that they were looking for someone to work in the office who knew something about editing a paper, and I had been editing-I had been editor of the union paper at Studebaker and 888 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I wanted to change jobs because the job at Studebaker was very hard on me physically. So I applied for this job with United Office and Professional Workers. They were at that time, that is, the regional office at that time was publishing a monthly paper for the insurance divisionMr. WHEELER. Would you say being a member of the Communist Party was a good recommendation for employment N ith the United Office and Professional Workers of America?
Miss KINNEY. So far as I know it had nothing to do with it. So far as I know, Morris Yanoff, who was the regional director, didn't know I was a Communist when he hired me.
Mr. WHEELER. You testified from the fall of 1940 until May 1942 you were working on the county membership committee, organizer for the 65th assembly district and also for a short period of time county membership director. What were your duties while working on the county membership committee?
Miss KINNEY. I think principally it was a matter of working out methods for keeping closer check on dues payments and transfers from one branch to another.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have anything to do with individuals being transferred out of the Los Angeles district and individuals being transferred in from other areas?
Miss KINNEY. As county membership director, I sent transfers out to San Francisco, the district office, if they were transferring somewhere out of the county.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any individuals that you transferred out of Los Angeles?
Miss KINNEY. No; I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any of the individuals who may have been transferred into Los Angeles?
Miss KINNEY. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals comprised the membership, the county membership commission
Miss KINNEY. I can only remember three of us, but it seems to me there was a fourth person. I don't remember who it was. The three I remember was myself, Helen Gardner, and Max Silver.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how long you were organizer for the 65th assembly district?
Miss KINNEY. I think only about 2 months.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone in the 65th assembly district as members of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Only the ones I mentioned previously, Anya Lieberson and Eddie Fisher were the two I mentioned before.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a membership director of the Los Angeles County
Miss KINNEY. I would say 4, possibly 5 months; not any longer.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the total membership of Los Angeles County during the time you were membership director in 1942?
Miss KINNEY. The figure, I think, was 3,000. It isn't necessarily correct, though.
Mr. WHEELER. What were your duties?
Miss KINNEY. To collect dues from the section membership directors, to handle transfers from one section to another within the county, COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 889 assign people being transferred into Los Angles County from outside, to send to the district office in San Francisco those transfers of people who were leaving the county.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of the individuals that you received dues from on the sectional level?
Miss KIKNEY. Well, as often as not it might be the section organizer who turned it over to me, rather than the section membership director. I remember some of the section organizers better than I do the membership directors.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you name the individuals?
Miss KINNEY. George Sandy.
Mr. WIIEELER. If you recall the district for which he was an organizer, will you please mention that?
Miss KINNEY. I think he was from the 12th Congressional District. Jean Mayer was section orgamzer in the 13th Congressional District.
Mr. WHEELER. How do you spell her last name?
Miss KINNEY. M-a-y-e-r, I guess. Frank Beye, from San Fernando Valley. Betty Martin, from the harbor. Miriam Brooks.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the organizer or the treasurer was of the northwest section, which comprised Hollywood?
Miss KINNEY. Elizabeth. I don't remember her last name.
Mr. WHEELER. Leech?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. How much money would you estimate that you received from these individuals a month?
Miss KINNEY. In the Hollywood section?
Mr. WHEELER. No, the whole Los Angeles County.
Miss KINNEY. I have no recollection.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you say $1,000?
Miss KINNEY. Honestly, I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how much money you received from the Hollywood section or the northwest section?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, because all that I received was the equivalent of unemployed dues, which were 10 cents a month. The rest of the dues which they paid were turned in direct to, I presume, the county organizer. The records only showed unemployed dues for Hollywood.
Mr. WHEELER. Did they turn them in to the county organizer or would these dues they collected from Hollywood go direct to the national?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know. I knew that I got only the unemployed amount, and that there was a larger amount which I never got.
Mr. WHEELER. Wouldn't this be considered unusual procedure?
Miss KINNEY. It was not like any other section.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever hear discussed how much money came out of Hollywood a month?
Miss KINNEY. Not that I recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you list all the Communist Party officials in Los Angeles County that you have met?
Miss KINNEY. Paul Cline. You want their titles?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. County organizer.
Mr. WHEELER. And approximate time he was county organizer, which went back to '38 or '39? 31747-53-pt 5--- 890 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. I think from '37 to sometime around-I don't know whether it was '-I0 or '41; I am not sure. Max Silver took his place. Pettis Perry, county chairman. Matt Pellman, as educational director for a while. Part of the time Al Ryan was educational director. Lou Baron, I think, was trade-union director at one time. Helen Gardner was membership director. I don't recall anybody else. 1 think in 1937, just before Paul Cline came, Betty Gannett was county organizer for a brief time. Carl Winter was county organizer in 1942. He came just a few months before I left Los Angeles. I can't think of anybody else.
Mr. WHEELER. Who of the Communist Party have you met that was on the national level of the party structure?
Miss KINNEY. At one time or another there were national committee members who spoke here at public meetings. I didn't meet them personally.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the political commission of the Communist Party
Miss KINNEY. I have a vague recollection there was some sort of committee set up at one time.
Mr. WHEELER. I have here a photostat of a card which I will hand you and ask you if it is your handwriting.
Miss KINNEY. The writing on one side is; the writing on the other side isn't.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you read into the record the portion of the handwriting that is yours?
Miss KINNEY. The portion that is mine is the side listing the names of three people. It states they are transferring into the political unit.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you read the names ?
Miss KINNEY. And signed Jane Howe.
Mr. WHEELER. Read the names and also party names.
Miss KINNEY. Dennis Dane. That is Leo Bigelman. Alice Starr, who was Rose Segure. And Margaret-it looks like P-e-t-o-s, who was Elnore Bogigian.
Mr. WHEELER. Was that Mrs. Murray Abowitz ?
Miss KINNEY. Was it?
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, it is Mrs. Murray Abowitz.
Miss KINNEY. I don't know whose writing this is on the other side.
Mr. WHEELER. I will introduce that as Kinney Exhibit No. 1. You have previously testified that in 1942 you became a member of the Studebaker branch of the Communist Party in Chicago, Ill. Will you give us the approximate date you moved to Chicago?
Miss KINNEY. I moved to Chicago in July of 1942. I didn't become a member of the Studebaker branch until, I think, December; transfers sometimes take a long time.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you transferred by the direction of the Communist Party
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have any discussion with any member of the Communist Party concerning your transfer? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 891 
Miss KINNEY. I decided on my own I wanted to go back to Chicago, and when I mentioned it to Carl Winter, who was the county organizer, he said, "Well, I don't know whether we will let you." I didn't like that. I intended to go anyway. But before I left he sent word to me, I think, by Max Silver, that it was all right for me to go.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he disturbed because you didn't advise him prior to the making of your decision to move to Chicago?
Miss KINNEY. I don't think Carl Winter ever liked anyone to make a decision that lie didn't approve of. It hadn't occurred to me that there would be any question or objection.
Mr. WHEELER. How many members comprised the Studebaker branch in Chicago?
Miss KINNEY. I think between 15 and 20, but I am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Were these individuals all employed with the Studebaker plant?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the United Auto Workers of America?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were any officials of the United Auto Workers of America members of the Communist Party, to your knowledge?
Miss KINNEY. You mean in our local union ?
Mr. WHEELER. In your local union.
Miss KINNEY. Yes, Carl Swanson, Gertrude Selig, and Evelyn Fargo were members of the Studebaker branch, and part of the time officers of the local union.
Mr. WHEELER. What number was the union?
Miss KINNEY. 998.
Mr. WHEELER. To your knowledge is it still m existence?
Miss KINNEY. I am sure it isn't because the plant was closed in, I think, June of 1945, and never reopened by Studebaker.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any other members of the Studebaker branch?
Miss KINNEY. Reva Handle, Wally, whose last name I can't remember. Evelyn Fargo was the other one. Jane March.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else?
Miss KINNEY. No, those were the only ones.
Mr. WHEELER. While a member of the Communist Party, and while assigned to the Studebaker branch, did you have any specific function with the union
Miss KINNEY. I was appointed to the staff of the union paper in June of 1943, and elected editor of the paper by the staff.
Mr. WHEELER. Did this paper reflect in any way the Communist Party line? Were you under any orders from the Communist Party to slant this publication in any way?
Miss KINNEY. I had some disagreements with some of the members 'of the branch, particularly Carl Swanson and Gertrude Selig, about whether or not the paper would be a miniature Daily Worker. I refused to turn it into that and maintained that it was a union paper and it should follow CIO policy. It did follow CIO policy.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at that time consider yourself in more agreement with CIO policy than the Communist Party directives? 892 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA In other words, did you place the CIO above the Communist Party while editor of this paper?
Miss KINNEY. It wasn't that clear-cut, but it seemed to me a union paper is a union paper, and that you don't turn a union paper into a Communist paper. I felt I was responsible to the entire union membership for putting out a paper that reflected the policies of the union.
Mr. WHEELER. Yes, but you still were removing yourself from Communist Party discipline, were you not ?
Miss KINNEY. Well, my disagreements didn't make me too popular in the branch. At that time there wasn't too much difference in the immediate policies of the Communist Party and the CIO. If there had been greater divergence, I think it might have created considerably more difficulties than it did.
Mr. WHEELER. You have previously testified that you were a member of the Hyde Park branch in Chicago from the fall of 1944 to the fall of 1945. What was the reason for your transfer from the Studebaker group to the Hyde Park group?
Miss KINNEY. The shop branch was disbanded. All shop branches were disbanded in the summer of 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this because of security reasons?
Miss KINNEY. No, this was during the period of the Communist Political Association.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members of the Hyde Park branch were ?
Miss KINNEY. Joan Place was the chairman of the branch. Lucy Arnold was a member. Sue Cohen, Morton Nadler. I told you he worked at Dodge. I was mistaken. It was Meyer Wineberg that worked at Dodge.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know where Morton Nadler worked?
Miss KINNEY. No. Jens and Sarah Simonsgard were members.
Mr. WHEELER. Are those all the individuals that you recall from this group ?.
Miss INNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. How big a group was this?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was supposed to have about 50 members. The attendance at meetings was perhaps about 20, at best.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you regular in your attendance ?
Miss KINNEY. I was not very regular in my attendance. I became less and less regular.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this the last group that you were in while a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. And when did you cease to attend this group ?
Miss KIN.iY. In the fall of 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Communist Party at any time give you any special training to assist you in furthering its program?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; here in Los Angeles, in 1937, I went to 2 weeks' county training school.
Mr. WHEELER. Where was this held?
Miss KINNEY. In Ocean Park, I believe, or Venice; I am not sure which.
Mr. WHEELER. How were you selected to attend this school? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 893 
Miss KINNEY. By the county committee.
Mr. WHEELER. Did they select individuals that they thought would make good workers for the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Presumably you had leadership possibilities.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who attended this meeting?
Miss KINNEY. You mean who were students at the school?
Mr. WIIEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. Helen Gardner was a student and LaRue McCormick, Betty Martin, Bob Cole.
Mr. WHEELER. IS Bob Cole or Robert Cole, the son of Rabbi Cohn?
Miss KINNEY. I think so. lMr.WIIEELER. How many people attended the school?
Miss KINNEY. Offlland, I would say 16 or maybe as many as 20; I am not sure
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructors were?
Miss KINNEY. Jules Carson was the director of the school. Paul Cline, I think, taught one session. Pettis Perry taught one session. J believe Lou Baron taught one session, but 1 am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the subjects that were taught to the students? 
Miss KINNEY. Perry was teaching Negro problems. Lou Baron taught trade-union problems. Paul Cline, I think, taught organization. I imagine that part of the time must have been spent on political economy.
Mr. WHEELER. Was anything of a revolutionary nature taught at this school?
Miss KINNEY. By that you mean-Mr. \WEELER. Anything that you could construe in your mind asMiss KINNEY. The question of the use of force and violence, you mean ?
Mr. WHEELEE. Well, yes. Force and violence.
Miss KINKEY. That is a question that they usually get around, and the party usually gets around that by stating that, of course, the party would like to see the working class take power peacefully, but that they would never be allowed to do it in a democratic way because the capitalist class would always use violence against the working class taking power. The assumption is that then the working class would have to defend itself.
Mr. WIIEELER. Did you in your own mind think that the Communist Party was a revolutionary party that would resort to force and violence here in the United States?
Miss KINNEY. I believed at that time what they told me; that is, what I have just explained. And the answer, if you raised a question about the use of force in the Russian revolution, was that the situation there was different than it might be here. and that there was no blueprint for how a revolution worked.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend any other training school?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; 1 went to a State training school in the fall of 1938 in San Francisco at the party's headquarters there, which I think were on Haight Street. 894 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you selected the same way for this training?'
Miss KINNEY. Yes; I was.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who were present as students?
Miss KINNEY. Dorothy Zadow, Jean Richardson, Donald Healey.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state what part of the State they were from, if you know ?
Miss KIxNEY. Dorothy Zadow was from Oakland. Jean Richardson was from San Diego.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that be Baibara Richardson?
Miss KINNEY. No; Jean.
Mr. WHEELER. Male or female?
Miss KINNEY. Female. Allen Yates, a seaman from San Francisco. John Bevins, Emil Freed from Los Angeles. Margaret Wilson, a blind girl from San Francisco. Arcus Reddock, from Arizona; but he didn't go back to Arizona.
Mr. VWHEELER. How about Honolulu, was anyone there from Honolulu?
Miss KINNEY. I am not sure. I don't think so.
Mr. WHEELER. We had some previous testimony about that period of time; a person named Robert McElrath, a seaman, originally from Seattle, attended school.
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember him.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructors were?
Miss KINNEY. There was a George McLean, a longshoreman flomn San Pedro there.
Mr. WHEELER. As a student?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. This school was under the direction of Louise Todd, and she taught some of the ehhsions. Betty Gainett taught most of the first 2 weeks. Oleta O'Connor, Jules Carson, Walter Lambert also taught. Most of them just 1 day.
Mr. WHEELER. Does that cover it?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember, there may have been 1 or 2 others, but I don't recall them.
Mr. WHEELER. Getting back for a moment to when you were county membership director, you stated that you received the dues collected by the secretary-treasurers or organizers. What did you do with this money? Did you place it in the bank account for the Communist Party in Los Angeles or did you turn it over to a superior?
Miss KINNEY. I turned over the county's percentage to Max Silver, I believe, but I am not sure whether it was to Max or somebody else. I recall it as being Max.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what the county percentage was?
Miss KINNEY. No. And I sent the rest to San Francisco.
Mr. WHEELER. To whom in San Francisco ?
Miss KINNEY. Leo Baroway.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where the Communist Party kept its bank account at that time ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know that they had one.
Mr. WHEELER. Getting back to the time when you were a member at large and working for Harrison George, I would like to read the following from executive testimony of the committee hearings which have been previously identified: COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 895 In the early part ot 1935, also. I think, I was called in to Di. Tashjian's' office to meet Harrison George, who is at present editor in chief of the People's World in San Francisco He informed me at that time that lie was working out here, had charge of a committee known as the Communist Party Phililpine Committee, which was charged with the duty of rendering assistance to the 'ommunist Party in the Philippine Islands. And on the occasion ot this meeting he asked that I C membersof the party in Los Angeles turn over to him immediately a hst of all who were either Japanese or Flhpinos, that they were to le organized into a separate group over which he would have jurisdiction. At a late meeting, under silllar conditions, they not only discussed phases of the Los Angeles County activity and gave us suggestions as to improving the tempo of our Communist n ork, but he asked me if I could find him a thoroughly trustworthy comrade who could bring some packages from San Pedro to Los Angeles for him He indicated to me he was receiving packages or mail from some of the ships in San Pedro and wanted a messenger to bring them from San Pedro to Los Angeles. Does that mean anything to you at all?
Miss KINNEY NO; I didn't know anything about any packages or anything about any Philippine committee
Mr. WEELER. It was during this period of time that you were acting as a messenger for Harrison George?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. And I thought that maybe you might have been the "thoroughly trustworthy comrade" selected.
Miss KINNEY. No; I wasn't.
Mr. TIIEELER. What was your reaction to the Stalin-Hitler Pact?
Miss KINNEY. I accepted the party's explanation.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the party's explanation given to you?
Miss KINNEY. As I recall, it was that this didn't mean that Russia condoned fascism with Germany, but because of the inability to reach an agreement with the IUnted States and England and France, it took this means of giving Russia longer to prepare for an inevitable attack. That is the way I remember it.
Mr. WHEELER. That was agreeable to you at that period of time?
Miss KINNEY. I accepted it.
Mr. WTHEELER. What was the Duclos letter?
Miss KINNEY. That was a letter written by the head of the French Communist Party, to whom I don't recall, but severely criticizing the Communist Party in the United States for its activity in the previous several years, and particularly for changing itself in 1944 from Communist Party to Communist Political Association, and ostensibly giving up any revolutionary aims for an indefinite period.
Mr. WHEELER. What effect did the Duclos letter have on the Communist Party in the United States?
Miss KINNEY. TO put it colloquially, it threw everybody into a panic and occasioned a great deal of discussion and a great deal of commotion.
Mr. WHEELER. Why? 
Miss KINNEY. Because it was extremely critical and because, apparently, Communists in other countries felt that the party here wasn't acting as it should and thereby, as they put it, betraying the interests of the working class.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you think that the defeat of Germany, Italy, and Japan had anything to do with the issuance of the Duclos letter ?
Miss KINNEY. I think it is quite possible. I had never thought about it. Di Vaughan A K Tashlian 896 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. During the war years that the Communist Party line was in accord with the Government of the United States?
Miss KINNEY. Winning the war was the primary consideration during the war years.
Mr. WHEELER. And actually the Communist Party line never deviated from the Government's position here. There wasn't any great deviation?
Miss KINNEY. No, no great deviation.
Mr. WHEELER. There was 100 percent war effort which the Communist Party backed.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Duclos letter change this cooperative attitude?
Miss KINNEY. Very definitely it did. I recall the idea was that the Communist Party here should forget about supporting the Government as it had during the war.
Mr. WHEELER. During the war years Browder put forth the coexistence policy that capitalism and communism could exist in this world; is that right?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What did the Duclos letter do? 
Miss KINNEY. The Duclos letter, as I recall, said, "You can't have any such equilibrium. Inevitably there is a clash between the two." And the idea, I think, was the sooner the better.
Mr. WHEELER. And Earl Browder was removed as the Communist PartyMiss KINNEY. The effect of the letter was that Browder was removed, but aside from minor shifting of positions, the rest of the leadership remained in leadership, but presumably following now a totally different line from the line that presumably they had all agreed to up until the day the Duclos letter appeared. It was as if somebody had said to a marching column, "About-face," and the column about-faced and started marching in the completely opposite direction.
Mr. WITEELER. It wouldn't be hard to find many such instances in the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNET. That, I think, is the most pronounced. I think that certainly one of the important effects of the Duclos letter, so far as I was concerned, was the hypocrisy and dishonesty that came to the surface at that time. People who had said one thing one day were now saying that this was all wrong and hadn't ought to be and that we should never have done it; we must do something else.
Mr. WHEELER. Well now, did you know John Leech to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. He has county organizer at one time.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know James Thorme to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KTNNEY. Yes. I think he was county, a county official at the time Leech was county organizer.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Morrie Smolan to be a Communist? To be a member of the Communist Party?

Miss KINNEY. Yes. She was in a professional branch, but I don't remember which one.

Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Zema Matlin to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know her occupation ?
Miss KINNEY. She was, at the time I knew her, executive secretary of the American League Against War and Fascism. That was in 1934.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Fred Franchia? 898 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. That is the husband of Davida Franchia. I don't recall seeing him in a meeting, but I somehow knew or thought he was a party member.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Howland Chamberlin to be a member of the Communist Partyi
Miss KINNEY. Yes. He was at one time in the theater-project branch and later, for a brief tune, on the 15th congressional section committee.

Miss KINNEY. Yes, but not the dance band leader. He was, I think, in the theater project branch, too.
Mr. WHEELER. vDid you know Leo Selfrid to be a member of the Communist Party

Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where he worked?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Miriam Holtz to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, she is a stenographer.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know her as a member of the Communist Party ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 899 
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr WHEELER. You previously stated in your testimony that the organizer for the 56th assembly district was known to you only as Anna: that you didn't recall her last name. 1 might ask you if you recognize this picture
Miss KINNlY.
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER. That might be a picture of her. It might be Ye-. Would you know her last name if I mentioned it to you?
Miss KINNEY. I might.
Mr. WHEELER. Galkin; G-a-1-k-i-n. 
Miss KINNEY. I think perhaps that is it.
Mr. WHEELER. What periods of time was she organizer for the 56th assembly district?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know. She was organizer when I was assigned to that branch, and she still was when I left it.
Mr. WHEELER. When was that?
Miss KINNEY. That was, I think, December of 1938 to August of 1939. 
Mr. WEELER. Now, can you recall at this time any other individual that you have met as a member of the Communist Party any place in the United States while you were a member?
Miss KINNEY. Ethel Holmstock. I didn't think of her before.
Mr. WHEELER. Who is she 
Miss KINNEY. She at one time was secretary of the China Aid Council.
Mr. WIIEELER. Now, the next question is, why did you leave the Communist Party after approximately 12 years of membership?
Miss KINNEY. That is a difficult question to answer, because disillusionment is a gradual process that begins with personal dissatisfaction-sometimes very vague in character-and progresses to more and more basic questions. It is a process that begins long before one leaves the party and continues for a long time afterward. When I left Los Angeles to go to Chicago in 1912, I had a sense of personal dissatisfaction, that there seemed to be no particular place for me in the pal ty. In Chicago, in the branch at Studebaker, some of this dissatisfaction disappeared temporarily. I was elected by the staff of the union paper to le editor, although the party branch had wanted a nonparty person in that position (with me to guide them). During the year I was editor I had some disagreements with the branch leaders because I insisted the paper not be turned into a miniature Daily Worker but use CIO policy as a guide. When the shop branch was disbanded, I was assigned to a neighborhood branch in 1Hyde Park. My attendance at meetings became less and less regular, and I participated in no activity. I was, like most people, greatly shocked and disturbed by the Duclos letter. It soon became evident that Browder was to be the scapegoat, but that the rest of the leaders would continue in their positions, but presumably along a completely different line. The hypocrisy and dishonesty that had always been under the surface came into full view. Since in Chicago I had never formed per- 900 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA sonal attachments, I could look at the whole thing more objectively and I drifted out without appearing to take any definite position. This was not difficult to do, since there was considerable reorganization going on. The process of disillusionment continues, until today I believe that Marxist theory is based on false premises and conditions which no longer are as true as they may have been a hundred years ago when Marx was developing his theories. I also believe that many things are done by the "inner circle" of the Communist Party of which the average member or minor functionary is completely unaware, and which he would strongly oppose. Democracy, as we know it in the United States, may bring about changes slowly. It may make mistakes and then correct them. It may not seem to have a clear blueprint for the future, but progress is made and the average individual has more freedom and more opportunity to lead his own life in his own way.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have any records that you may have retained while you were a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Your statement will be most interesting to the committee, Miss Kinney. Thank you very much. (Whereupon the statement of Miss Kinney was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Hollywood, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT' An executive statement, given at 4:15 o'clock p. m., February 17, 1953, at 6400 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. INTERROGATION OF MILDRED BENOFF
Mr. WHEELER. Will the witness state her full name, please ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Mildred Benoff. Do you want my maiden name?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes, please.
Mrs. BENOFF. Stern.
Mr. WHEELER. Where do you presently reside?
Mrs. BENOFF. 160 South Vista Street, Los Angeles 36.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you born?
Mrs. BENOFF. May 30, 1920.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently under subpena to appear before the Committee on Un-American Activities on March 23, 1953?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes, I am.
Mr. WHEELER. You are, however, appearing voluntarily today to answer any questions propounded by me?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. You know I am an investigator of the House Committee on Un-American Activities?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. You further realize by giving me this statement it does not in any way cancel your subpena, and it is up to the committee's discretion whether to call you or not.
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Benoff, have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes, I have.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first become a member ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Sometime in '44. I am sorry, I am very vague on dates. It was in '44, but I can't remember what month.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say it might have been 1943?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. SReleased by the committee Mildred Benoff wis sworn as a witness by the court reporter 902 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHIELER. The records of the committee show you joined the Communist Party in September 1943. I was wondering if it might be correct.
Mrs. IBEXOFF. No. I may have started going to meetings then, but I did not go in then.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the designation of the branch to which you were assigned?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Mr. WIIEELER. Was It a branch comprised only of women?
Mrs. BENOFF. Just a few women. There was this one mlan, Mischa, with his wife. I didn't have anything to do with Hollywood. This man seemed to have the hands of a working man.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you relate the events that led to your joining the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. When I came out here I started working for Russian War Relief.
Mr. WHIEELER. Will you state the time you came out?
Mrs. BENOFF. We came out in July '43. I joined the Russian War Relief, which was an open and very pleasant organization to belong to at the time. There I met Elena Beck, and she and I became close friends at the time. She was having a good deal of difficulty with her husband. I wi having my trouble adjusting from . very different kind of life in New York City to the life here. I was interested in proving myself as an individual in my own right. Elena seemed to be the one To help me this way very much. She told me that part of my growth, part of my groin g up would be to develop politically. She did her best. She took me to several meetings over a period of time. My resistance to joining the party was that it was secretive, and knowing Max', great resistance to itM1. WHIEELER. By Max you are referring to your husband?
Mrs. BEiNOFF. Yes-and I didn't want to join that. When I did join it was with the understanding it would be an open organization and would no longer be the Communist Party, but was on the way of being the Communist Political Association.
Mr. WIEELER. You mentioned your husband's name, Max Benoff. You brought his name into the testimony, and I might ask in what ways he showed resistance to the Commumiit Party.
Mrs. BENOFF. General discussion.
Mr. WHEELER. You had previously discussed the Communmit Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. Well. when you live with a person over a number of years, even if you didn't nevertheless, you do have views and your views will he discussed.
Mr. WHEELER. Did I break the continuity of your thought!
Mrs. BENOFF. I will try to recall t at atpoint I left off. I was assured by Elena and the others that this would be an open organization, that eventually everyone would be openly known, that there would be nothing secretive about it. I guess I was just right for joining, and this I did. As I told my attorney Mr. Gang, when I did, it was with my full naiii, with the hopes that eventually it was going to be a really and truly open thing. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 903 
Mr. WhIIEELER. Elena Beck was actually responsible for recruiting you into this movement?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes. Actually, when I finally was a member and had gone to these several meetings it seemed to me that nothing really had changed and it wasn't on the n ay to being an open organization. It was just as secretive as before. At this time I was quite pregnant and my husband was facing induction. I was 3,000 miles from home and without a very good help situation, and another child, and my problem was somehow to keep Max with me until I give birth to imy child and could get some family out with me.
Mr. WII:IELFR. Now, do you recall in whose home these meetings were held ?
Mrs. BEX.NFI. 'lThe ones I can recall, meetings in Pauline Townsend's homeAlr. WHEELER. Are those the Townsends wlho live lip in Laurel / (anyon
Mrs. BENOFF. No I was taken by Elena Beck. She would pick me up. I couldn't find my way to these homes again. And Tama Tuttle.
Mr. WHEELER. How about your own home?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Are those the only two places you remember going to meetings?
Mrs. BENOFF. That I can say I remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else were members of this group?
Mrs. BENOFF. Pauline Townsend, Tania Tuttle, Elena Beck, Marie Rinaldo, and this Miscla. If I knew his second name I don't recall it. AIr. WHIEELER. Do vou recall anyone else? AMrs. BiE'FF. His wife.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her name?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mrs. BEXOFF. Mischa is also i nickname in Russia, you know. I don't know if that is any help.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else? 
Mrs. BENOFF. It was a very small group. No.
Mr. WHEELER. How many members would you say comprised this?
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know. A half a dozen all told, I would say.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you only in one group during the time of your membership
Mrs. BENOFF. That is all.
Mr. WHEELER. Or two? 
Mrs. BENOFF. NO, just one group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Ruth Burrows a member of this group'
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Ruth Burrows as a member of I le Communist Party'
Mrs. BENOFF. No I know Ruth Burrows. I didn't meet her as a member of the Communist Party, to my knowledge.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Ruth Kanin ?
Mrs. BEXOFr. Yes. I think she is Michael Kanin's sister, from meeting her at the Kanin home. 904 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet her as a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Anna Lask?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. You don't know her at all? 
Mrs. BENOFF. No, not at all.
Mr. WHEELER. How about Bea Buchman ?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Dalton Trumbo?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if anyone came in to instruct your group on the theory of Marxism or anything?
Mrs. BENOFF. I think one man. I can't say I recall him. I just vaguely remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay dues to the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes. I told Mr. Gang I assumed I did. I don't remember giving anyone dues, or who I gave it to; I just can't remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the leaders of the group, if you recall?
Mrs. BENOFF. It seems to me this man Mischa knew more politically; that is about all. Just general discussion.
Mr. WHEELER. How long would you say you were a member of this group'
Mrs. BENOFF. Several months.
Mr. WHEELER. Five, four?
Mrs. BENOPF. Something like that, I would say; the best I can say.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your estimate of the number of meetings you attended?
Mrs. BENOFF. Oh, I don't know. I would say a dozen. It is hard to say.
Mr. WHEELER. What would be your best guess?
Mrs. BENOFF. I just would assume a dozen. I would say a dozen. That is the best I can do.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party while in New York City ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, not at all.
Mr. WHEELER. After your cleavage with the Communist Party, did anyone attempt to re-recruit you!
Mrs. BENOFF. Elena did, just for a while, when I was still pregnant and hadn't given birth to my baby. She asked if I wouldn't come. By this time I was growing up. I was much more concerned with my immediate problems and didn't have time for that.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Benoff at any time accompany you to any of the meetings?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, never.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Benoff know of your membership in the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. lHedidn't know until I think you yourself told him, and Mr. Gang told him.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have any knowledge of your husband's membership in the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, I did not. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 905 
Mr. WHEELER. Would it have been possible for him to have been a member of the Communist Party without your knowing it?
Mrs. BENOFF. To the best of my knowledge, knowing Max, I would Max is just not that type, he is not say he was never a Communist. 1 a joiner of any kind.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you like to elaborate at all as to the reason why you left the party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. It just seemed to me kind of not grownup at all, contrary to what they say. But, actually, kind of an evaluation of the realities of life, which is bringing up children and facing your difficulties with your husband and adjusting yourself to the society you are living in. And the meetings were really very dull.
Mr. WHEELE. What is your present attitude concerning the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would say the same. I think it is not realistic. If it was, all this couldn't have happened.
Mr. WHEELER. All of what?
Mrs. BENOFF. War, and the things they told you that the Communist Party was doing when they were trying to get you to join, that they were fighting Hitler. I do feel very strongly about that. I am a strong Jew. And to this day that is how I feel about that.
Mr. WHEELER. When you were in it, what did you find out?
Mrs. BENOFF. This wasn't really the issue. They weren't doing any better job than anyone else, and I really found it dull, and it was a waste of a good evening after a while. It just didn't seem adult.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there any discussion about subversion or anything illegal?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. Honestly, if anything, what you might classify as a study group and a very dull one.
Mr. WHEELER. What did you study
Mrs. BENOFF. As I recall now, it was the encouragement to read Marxism. At best I am not a student. And I was very anxious not to bring any material home with me. For a while it was really quite exciting, exciting being with what I thought were very forward-thinking people. When that wore off it was nothing.
Mr. WHEELER. During this time when you were a member of the Communist Party, were you and your husband living together?
Mrs. BENOFF. Oh, yes, we lived together all the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there any discussion between you and your husband as to where you were spending your evenings?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. I didn't question him and he didn't question me.
Mr. WHEELER. What do you think of the Communist Party as it has been operating the last few years?
Mrs. BENOFF. Well, I no longer think it is a thing to belong to. I think they are mistaken. I think their attitude has caused a lot of distress. And as a Jew, it isn't my answer.
Mr. WHEELER. Let's clarify that.
Mrs. BENOFF. Not the answer to my problems. It is not the answer to my problems. . Testimony of Max Nathan Benoff March 24, 195, is printed in "Investigation of Communist Activities in the Los Angeles Area-Part i," beginning with p. 355. 31747-53-pt. 5--5 906 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you join the Communist Party purely on a racial basis?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would say yes and no. I was very disturbed by Hitler and very frightened by him.
Mr. WHEELER. What events fix the time when you severed connections with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. My second child was going to be born at the end of November.
Mr. WHEELER. Of what year?
Mrs. BENOFF. Of 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. How long prior to that time did you cease going to meetings?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would say quite a bit before.
Mr. WHEELER. You say quite a bit?
Mrs. BENOFF. Two or three months, really.
Mr. WHEELER. If you joined sometime in December of 1943, you left sometime in the fall of 1944?
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know if it was necessarily the summer of 1944. It might have been the spring of '44.
Mr. WHEELER. As I previously stated, our records show it was September 1943.
Mrs. BENOFF. I was going to ask you. Elena first started taking me to meetings around that time. I did not join at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. These meetings she started to take you to prior to your membership, in what classification do you put this type of meeting?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would assume them to be Communist Party meetings or study groups.
Mr. WHEELER. Indoctrination course on Marxism?
Mrs. BENOFF. These meetings didn't change from when I was in the party. No one said, "This is a party meeting." The same people were there. They were very charming, very cordial, very friendly people. There was no difference. In other words, you weren't told, "This is an indoctrination meeting for when you will go into the party."
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings of this nature did you attend before becoming an actual member of the party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know. Several, half a dozen or more, possibly. I just don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. The personnel of the meetings did not change at all, in other words.
Mrs. BENOFF. No, not to my knowledge or recollection.
Mr. W rEE.IREa. You have identified every person you met?
Mrs. BENOFF. That I can remember.
Mr. WHEELER. To be a member of the Communist Party.
Mrs. BENOF. That I can remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you think you may have forgotten any?
Mrs. BENOFF. Time passes. I have suppressed this a long time. My husband didn't know. I really suppressed this. I know that Elena was my friend and did bring me to these meetings, and this was it. It didn't change in character then, so therefore I can assume it was Communist Party meetings she was taking me to. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. You didn't answer my question. 907 I asked you if there is a possibility you may have forgotten some individuals who may have attended these meetings.
Mrs. BENOFF. I may have forgotten possibly before I joined. But when I joined those were the ones I remember. These I haven't forgotten because it was a very small group.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals attended the so-called indoc- trination ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Again it was just a small group. Could it have been more than the actual people you
Mr. VWHFE1.ER. previously mentioned?
Mrs. BENOFF. I can't say that. I can't recall. Possibly there was another person. I just can't recall, to say they made a special impression on me, because they didn't. 
Mr. WHEELER. You, however, are positive you never met Ruth Burrows as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, but I do know this woman.
Mr. WHEELER. Or Ruth Kanin ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Or Anna Lask? 
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know her at all. Ruth Kanin I met through her brother Mike.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you seen any of the people socially or otherwise in the last 7 years ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. I saw Ruth Kanin at her brother's home. She came out to visit. That was about all; we had very little in common.
Mr. WHEELER. You said you didn't know her in the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. I am talking about the ladies in your group in the Communist Party. Have you ever seen any of them in the last 7 years?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO, except, as I told you, if I met them on the street or at nursery school, or something like that.
Mr. WHEELER. You have never had any social contact with them?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, or phone calls or any kind of contact.
Mr. WHEELER. From the time you broke with the group you have never rejoined?
Mrs. BENOFF. I severed all relation; that is right.
Mr. WHEELER. Is there anything you would like to add before we conclude your testimony? 
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Thank you, Mrs. Benoff. (Whereupon the interrogation of Mrs. Benoff was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT An executive statement given at 10 a. m., March 12, 1953, at room 1109, Statler Hotel, Los Angeles, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. TESTIMONY OF STANLEY RUBIN2
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state your full name ? 
Mr. RUmN. My name is Stanley Rubin; R-u-b-i-n.
Mr. WHEELER. When and where were you born? 
Mr. RuiTN. I was born in New York City October 8, 1917.
Mr. WHEELER. Give us your educational background. 
Mr. RuBIN. I went to public schools in New York City, to junior high school in New York City, and to DeWitt Clinton High School. I finished high school in January of 1933. In September of 1933 I came out to California to go to the University of California in Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you graduate from UCLA? 
Mr. RUBIN. No; I did not get a degree from UCLA. I went 4 years. At the end of my fourth year I was still short a few units, but I had to go to work.
Mr. WTHEELER. What year did you cease to be a student?
Mr. RuIN. June 1937.
Mr. WHEELER. How have you been employed since June 1937? 
Mr. RuBIN. I worked for a short while as a cub reporter and general flunky for the Beverly Hills Citizen News, and then became mail boy or messenger room worker at Paramount Studios. I worked as a cub reporter and flunky for the Beverly Hills Citizen News, roughly, through the balance of 1937 and possibly into 1938. I then went to work at Paramount in the mailroom as a messenger boy. I worked in the mailroom for Paramount a little less than a year. During this time I was writing fiction-I should say I was trying to write fiction. I finally sold a magazine article on my mailroom experience to the Grover Jones magazine. This was a west coast publication put out by a screen writer named Grover Jones. Released by the committee. Stanley Rubin was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 910 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA Through this story and through Mr. Jones' help I came to the attention of the Paramount story department and when they offered me work as an outside reader I left the mailroom department. That was sometime in late 1938. S S Do you want me to go on?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes; up to the present time.
Mr. RUBI. I then started work as an outside reader, working mostly for Paramount Studios, but recommended by them I also did some outside reading for Samuel Goldwyn Studios and for RKO. I then was called in to an interview at Universal Studios for a possible job in the story department. The story editor was a man named Marshall Grant. I got the job. I worked as a reader and an assistant to Mr. Grant probably for a little less than a year, at which time Mr. Grant was promoted from story editor to a producer. When Mr. Grant became a producer he offered me a job of working as a writer for him. This was my first entrance into screen writing. I wrote a good number of pictures for Umversal, working not only for
Mr. Grant but also for several other producers whose names I have given you in a statement previously, and I would be willing to discuss if you so desire.
Mr. WHEELER. That won't be necessary. Late in 1940 I was offered a higher paying writing
Mr. RuBI. job at Twentieth Century-Fox, and went to work there as a free-lance writer. From that time on I was in the freelance writers' market, taking jobs by the assignment. In 1941 I worked mostly for Columbia Pictures. In the fall of 1941, being unemployed, or, rather, being without a studio on assignment, I collaborated with a radio writer named Jerome Lawrence on a speculative piece of original material,.which we sold to Columbia Broadcasting System for a Christmas show. Since the show was to be done out of New York, I went East to work on it. And I came back to California shortly after the New Year and sought employment again, and finally found it back at Columbia Pictures. When I completed my work at Columbia Pictures I enlisted in the Army Air Forces. That was September 10, 1942. I enlisted as a private in the Air Forces. I got out of the Army as a first heutenant early in 1946.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your present status with the Army?
Mr. RUIN. I am a first lieutenant in the Army Air Forces Reserves.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, while in the Army, what type of assignments did you have?
Mr. RUBIN. I was assigned by the Air Force to its motion-picture unit, and my general work consisted of doing orientation, training, and combat films. I worked at many airfields around the country. For example, Randolph Field, in Texas, Langley Field, in Virginia, and Scott Field, in Missouri, Mitchel Field, in Long Island.
Mr. WHEELER. While in the Army did you have access to classified or confidential information?
Mr. RuIN. Yes, I did. At one point I volunteered for an overseas assignment which was classified. That consisted of an aerial COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA, 911 mapping of Alaska and North Pacific flight routes. For completing this assignment successfully I was given . personal commendation by the Air Transport Command. Subsequently I also volunteered for a highly secret mission in which I was transferred to the first B-29 group training in the United States. My job to move in with these men, live with them, train with them, fly with them. And finally I went to Saipan with them to participated in their strikes at Truk, and Iwo Jima, and their first B-29 strike at Tokyo. All of this I recorded on film for the Air Forces. Finally, upon my return to the States, I edited this film into one unified picture. The Air Force was pleased with this picture, which was titled "Target Tokyo," and released it to theaters throughout the Nation. Again I was personally commended by Headquarters, Army Air Forces. To clear me for this mission, I was investigated by the local FBI, ONI, Service Command Intelligence, and home-town police. I assume the results were satisfactory, as I continued in confidential work.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, after your release from the United States Army, did you continue your employment in the motion-picture industry ?
Mr. RUBIN. Yes, I did. I was offered a job again at Universal Pictures by the same man I had worked for there originally, Marshall Grant. I went to work for him as a writer-associate producer, and worked there roughly 9 or 10 months, at which time Universal Pictures were taken over by International Studios. When I left Universal I was back in the free-lance market. I started speculative writing again, doing radio scripts with a radio writer I had met in the Army named Joe Malone, and doing pictures with a screen writer named Louis Lantz, whom I had met at Columbia [Pictures] just before the war. Malone and I sold many radio scripts to the Whistler, Theater of Romance, Hollywood Theatre of the Air. Lantz and I worked for Monogram Pictures and then for Columbia Pictures. Sometime late in 1947 or early in 1948 1 had an idea for a film service for television, which was then just beginning to take very rapid strides forward. Lantz collaborated with me on this television idea and we turned it into a pilot script. I then went back to Marshall Grant, who in the meantime had formed his own independent picture company called Sheg, Inc., for production advice. Grant introduced me to a short-subject director named Sobey Martin, and to a man of finance named Norman Elzer. Then Martin, Lantz, Elzer, and myself incorporated our own company, Realm Television Productions, Inc. We made our first film. It was shown to the American Tobacco Co., which liked it enough to offer us a contract to make the first 26 half-hour films on television, to be sponsored by a national company. It took us a year and a half to make these 26 pictures for the American Tobacco Co. That takes me to the summer of 1949, at which time, seeking employment, I was hired again as a writer by Mr. Sid Rogell, head of production at RKO. After one script for Mr. Rogell, he offered me a job there as a producer, which I accepted. 912 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I worked as a producer for RKO for a little under a year, at which time Wald & Krasna came in and asked me to join their unit. I worked in the Wald & Krasna unit as an associate producer for approximately a year. Then Twentieth Century-Fox offered me a better contract as a full producer, and in June of 1951 I moved over to Twentieth CenturyFOx.
Mr. WHEELER. What screen credits do you have, Mr. Rubn?
Mr. RUBIN. Shall I start at the beginning and go right through?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes, start at the beginning.
Mr. RUBIN. My pictures include both in solo work and in collaboration. South To Katanga, Flying Cadets, Mister Dynamite, Bombay Clipper, Six Lessons From Madam Lazonga, Where Did You Get That Girl, Lucky Legs, Two Senoritas From Macao. Do you want producer credits, too, separately?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Mr. RsBIN. Macao, and my producer credits include Little Miss Big, Slightly Scandalous, The Narrow Margin, Behave Yourself, My Pal Gus, and Destination Gobi.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Rubin, who is your agent?
Mr. RUBIN. My agent is Famous Artists.
Mr. WHEELER. How long have you been associated with Famous Artists ?
Mr. RUBIN. I have been associated with Famous Artists, I would say, a little more than 3 years, but the man in Famous Artists who represents me, named Ray Stark, was my agent even before I was with Famous Artists. He was in partnership with a company called Levee-Stark. When he moved from that company to Famous, I went with him.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you had any other agents besides Mr. Stark?
Mr. RuBIN. Yes. As I called it, my first agent in town was Ned Brown; at that time he was an independent agent. I was also subsequently represented by the Sam Jaffee office, and by the Allen Berg office.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Rubin, information has come to the attention of the committee that you were in attendance at meetings of the Communist Party. Is that true?
Mr. RUBIN. No; it is not true. I did attend what were described to me as classes; another term for which I have now heard is a study group. That was supposed to inform me on the Communist Party and on Marxism and Soviet Russia.
Mr. WHEELER. When did this occur?
Mr. RUaIN. This occurred in the spring-no, I am sorry. I was first told or asked about them in the spring of 1942, but to the best of my recollection I started attending either late in the spring of 1942 or early in the summer of 1942.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you explain fully how you became associated with this group ?
Mr. RUBIN. In 1941 I was working at Columbia Pictures and I met the writer in the office next to me.
Mr. WHEELER. What was his name?
Mr. RuBIN. His name was Louis Lantz. We weren't working together; we just shared adjoining offices and became friendly. This COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 913 acquaintance developed into friendship through the course of discussing story problems and through social evenings. Sometime in the spring of 1942, after I had become friends with Mr. Lantz, he surprised me one evening by bringing up the subject of the Communist Party. Mr. Lantz expressed the belief that communism was the answer for any man of liberal views, and he asked me if I was interested in it. I told him that I had never thought about it, that I knew nothing about it, that I really knew nothing about it, and that besides, despite my liberal instincts, I was not political. The matter rested there for a week or two and then on another evening Mr. Lantz brought it up again. This time he asked me, since I admitted total ignorance about communism, would I be interested in attending a series of discussions or classes which would inform me on the Communist Party, Marxism, and Soviet Russia. I thought it over and finally said that I would be interested. There were many reasons behind my accepting this idea of attending classes on the various aspects of communism. These reasons being both emotional and growing out of the lopsided attitude and atmosphere of the times. In the first place, at that time Soviet Russia was our war ally, accepted from the White House down. I was interested in what had been going on in that country and I was curious about what had been going on in that country. In the second place, my earlier revulsion at the Soviet-Nazi Pact had been replaced by an admiration for the courageous stand of the Russian soldiers which they were making against the Nazi armies. As a Jew, my sympathies naturally went out to everyone and anyone fighting Hitlerism. Finally, I was interested in educating myself on the subject which was part of the world I was living in. The Communist Party was a so-called legal party, about which I knew nothing. I was 24 years old at the time, highly idealistic and intellectually curious. I was eager to hear and debate new ideas, and I decided there was nothing to fear. If I didn't like the classes I would cease to attend. As things turned out, I was disgusted and disillusioned after only 3 or 4 sessions of the class, and I never went back.
Mr. WHEELER. What caused your disillusionment
Mr. RuBIN. The general conduct of the classes. I had been told that this was to be a discussion group in which we would discuss various aspects of the subjects named. Instead of discussion, however, I heard diatribes. Instead of open debate I got closed edicts. I had gone, ready to discuss anything, but before very long I learned the discussion group was not ready to discuss anything. The best example I can remember was when the leader of the discussion group, a screen writer named Mitchell Wilson, brought up the subject of Trotskyism.
Mr. Wilson painted the followers of Trotsky as liars, assassins, and villains incarnate. Anyone trying to get a grasp of true communism,
Mr. Wilson stated, had better make sure that he had no Trotskyites among his friends or acquaintances. Now, I knew practically nothing about Mr. Trotsky and I certainly held no brief for him, but the idea that a supposedly American politi- 914 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA cal party would try to dictate with whom I was to associate and to whom I was to talk was totally reprehensible and inacceptable to me.
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings of this study group would you say you attended?
Mr. RUBIN. Roughly 3 or 4.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where they were held ?
Mr. RUBIN. Yes. They were held at the home of a screen writer named Mitchell Gordon.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mitchell Gordon at any of these discussions?
Mr. RUBIN. To the best of my knowledge he was not.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mr. Lou Lantz present? 
Mr. RuBIN. No. Mr. Lantz was not present.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was present ? 
Mr. RUBIN. The only one I definitely recall was the leader of the group, Mitchell Wilson. The others I hadn't known before and I have never seen since. And after a lapse of 11 or more years I just don't remember any of them.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Meta Reis? 
Mr. RuBIN. Yes, I know Meta Reis.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall whether or not she was present?
Mr. RUBIN. To the best of my knowledge, Meta Reis was not present.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Oscar Saul?
Mr. RBIN. I know Oscar Saul.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Oscar Saul present?
Mr. RuBIN. No, Oscar Saul was not present.
Mr. WHEELER. You are stating that categorically.
Mr. RUBIN. Perhaps I had better say to the best of my knowledge. I stated categorically, feeling that if Oscar Saul had been present-I have known him as a screen writer, or I have seen him at Guild meetings or at parties, social affairs since.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Ed Rolfe?
Mr. RUBIN. I met Ed Rolfe at the home of Lou Lantz, either at a social evening or dinner.
Mr. WHEELER. Do yOU know Bess Taffel?
Mr. RUBIN. The same applies to her. I met her at the home of Louis Lantz.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals would you say attended this study group?
Mr. RuBsi. My best recollection is roughly 5, 6, or 7 at the most.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified that Mr. Lantz was instrumental in getting you to attend these study group meetings.
Mr. RuBIN. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you discuss your leaving the discussion group meetings with Mr. Lantz?
Mr. RUBIN. Yes, I did.
Mr. WHEELER. You did?
Mr. RuBIN. Yes, I did. After the meeting which particularly annoyed and disillusioned me, when I decided I wasn't going back to another class, I told Mr. Lantz my reactions to the kind of totalitarian viewpoint and discussion that had been going on, citing the reference to Trotsky that I mentioned above, and told him I was not going back to another class. Never subsequently did Mr. Lantz himself ever try to persuade me to go back to the classes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 915 
Mr. WHEELER. What was Mr. Lantz' reaction?
Mr. RUBIN. Mr. Lantz just accepted it.
Mr. WHEELER. What did he say?
Mr. RUBIN. Mr. Lantz actually tried to discuss it with me. He tried to point out that this was not totalitarianism, but merely, in his opinion, an effort at organization or at organizational discipline. I told him I couldn't accept this argument, that it wouldn't change my mind.
Mr. Lantz then accepted my argument, and as I have stated, made no further attempt to persuade me to return to the classes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Lantz ever directly ask you to become a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. RuIN. No, he did not.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you reach any conclusion in your own mind regarding Mr. Lantz' political affiliation?
Mr. RUBIN. Well, as I have said before, I attended no meetings to compare, and therefore never saw Mr. Lantz at any meeting of the Communist Party. I have no direct knowledge of Mr. Lantz being a Communist or of Mr. Lantz having been a Communist. The only thing I can say to you, if you want it, is that I assumed in my own mind, since Lantz said to me it was his belief that communism was the best answer for a man of liberal viewpoints, that at that time he either was a Communist or was sympathetic to the Communist viewpoint.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Rubin, I would like to repeat a sentence you just testified to. "He tried to point out that this was not totalitarianism, but merely, in his opinion, an effort at organization or at organizational discipline." What conclusion did you reach when Mr. Lantz stated to you that this was just a matter of accepting organizational discipline?
Mr. RunN. Let me make this clearer. I believe, or I should say I think I can make this clearer. Mr. Lantz did not say to me that I was to accept organizational discipline. He was explaining, I assumed, a theory or his viewpoint of communism and the Communist Party, and this viewpoint was that to understand communism you had to accept certain channels, certain precepts of Marxism.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Lantz then had accepted the discipline ?
Mr. RUBIN. I don't know. I will answer that, to the best of my ability.
Mr. WHEELER. He was espousing the theory that discipline should be accepted by Marxists or Communists?
Mr. RuBIN. Yes, he was.
Mr. WHEELER. You don't recall anyone else who was in attendance at these meetings?
Mr. RuIN. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you attended any meetings of the progressive caucus of the Screen Writers' Guild, and if so, where were these meetings held?
Mr. RUBIN. I can't honestly say. I attended meetings-the only specific meetings I recall of the progressive caucus-and there may have been others-that I attended were held usually just before the Screen Writers' Guild regular meeting; either at the hotel where the meeting was to take place or in the very room, or outside the very room the meeting was to take place. 916 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. What was the purpose of these meetings of the progressive caucus?
Mr. RuIN. The purpose of the meetings of the progressive caucus was to discuss the agenda that was coming up at the subsequent Screen Writers' Guild meeting and to try to organize everyone who attended the progressive caucus meeting into a single viewpoint on the subjects that were to come up.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the leaders in the progressive caucus? Explain what was the progressive caucus, please.
Mr. RuBIN. The progressive caucus to me was just what its name said. I took it to be a group of writers within the Screen Writers' Guild, whose viewpoints on union activities were liberal, and who would work for these viewpoints.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the leaders!
Mr. Runen. I can't answer that. I don't know who the leaders of the progressive caucus were.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals were members of the progressive caucus?
Mr. RurB. That is a very difficult question to answer, because when I went to a meeting of the progressive caucus, on the various occasions when they asked me to come, the attendance varied enormously.
Mr. WHEELER. From what to what?
Mr. REBIN. From, let's say, 15 people up to as high as, let's sayI don't know-40, 50 people.
Mr. WHEELER. Who is "they"? Who asked you to go to these meetings?
Mr. RuEns. I have to think back on that. I cannot say definitely who asked me to go to these meetings. I will try to recall to the best of my ability how some of these things came about. In one instance it might have been a phone call. In another instance I may have received a mimeographed letter or sheet which stated what the progressive caucus was going to discuss at its meeting before the next guild meeting, and asking me to come. Now, these mimeographed sheets occasionally were signed by members of the Screen Writers' Guild, but I honestly don't remember who signed them.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember any specific subject which was discussed?
Mr. RumI. It was always the current working business of the guild that was discussed. And I was by no means a regular attender of the progressive caucus. As I have explained or tried to explain in a statement I have submitted, when they would inform me by phone or by mimeographed letter of a subject in which I agreed with their viewpoint, which was also expressed in that phone call, I would attend the meeting and try to help them on that point in the subsequent Screen Writers' Guild meeting discussion or vote. When I disagreed with the point involved, I did not attend the progressive caucus. I know for a fact that the negative was far more frequent than the positive, but, nevertheless, I did attend several progressive caucus meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. How closely have you followed the investigation here in Hollywood, being conducted by the committee?
Mr. RuBIN. Average closely. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 917 
Mr. WHEELER. You are familiar then with the great number of writers who have been identified as members of the Communist Party?
Mr. RuBIN. I am familiar, I should say, with the ones whose names have appeared in the newspaper, in the main, or with people I have been acquainted with who have.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say the percentage of people in attendance at the progressive caucus meeting was largely made up of subsequently identified members of the Communist Party
Mr. RuBIN. I would say that many of the people named were present at progressive caucus meetings; that is, at that time they had not been named. But subsequently, when I discovered their names, they had been present at the progressive caucus meetings. But I would not say, for example, that they were preponderant, necessarily preponderant at those meetings. For example, the only way I can state it is if there were 40 members present at a meeting, to discuss a subject that was coming up, my guess now would be, say, 25 or 30 percent of the people there were subsequently named.
Mr. WHEEILE. You testified you left this study group in 1942.
Mr. RuBIN. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Since leaving this group, have you been approached by anyone to resume your association with them
Mr. RUBIN. Yes, I was. This happened after I was released from the Army Air Forces in 1946 and had gone back to work at Universal Pictures. One day, to the best of my knowledge, in mid-spring of 1946, I received a phone call. It was from a woman whose name I had never heard before, and if she gave it to me over the phone or to my secretary-because I had never heard it-I paid no particular attention to it, and I do not remember it now. However, this woman over the phone asked me if I would consider joining a new evening study group. I told her emphatically I would not, and hung up the phone.
Mr. WHEELER. In recent years have you had any close association with Mr. Lantz ?
Mr. RUBIN. Yes, I have. Again-and this does not attempt to undermine the friendship-the association has been sporadic, but, nevertheless, it has been a fairly close friendship.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever discussed the Communist Party in recent years?
Mr. RUBIN. Yes, I have. Mr. Lantz, as I recall it, got out of the Army sometime in the spring of 1946. When I saw him after that I told him about this phone call I had received. I told him also that I had flatly turned the woman down, and I remember discussing the incident with him. I was particularly pleased at that time to find that Mr. Lantz agreed with what I had said to this woman and with what I had done. And to the best of my recollection the gist of Mr. Lantz' conversation to me at that time was that he was no longer in sympathy with communism or the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. This was in 1946 ?
Mr. RUBIr. That is correct.
Mr. WrHEELER. Subsequent to 1946, have you and Mr. Lantz had any discussions? 918 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. ERUIN. From the time of that conversation in 1946 until a few days ago Mr. Lantz and I had no discussions about the Communist Party at all.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have a discussion a few days ago?
Mr. RUBI. Yes, we did.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the nature of this discussion?
Mr. Rwran. Well, when the. studio informed me of certain items that had been listed against me, including one which stated that I was known to have been a Communist Party member, and asked me to answer these charges, I went about the business of answering them. In preparing an answer to the items given me by my employer, I went into my files and records, and talked to people, to refresh my recollection, so that I could prepare a statement under oath, which 1 did do, which I have delivered to my employer and a copy of which I have given to you, Mr. Wheeler. In that connection I went to see Mr. Lantz. I felt that I had done nothing whatsoever that was wrong, and I went to see Mr. Lantz to tell him that I was going to make a full statement of the study group classes I had attended and that this would necessarily involve my telling who had asked me to these classes. I wanted Mr. Lantz to understand what I was doing, and I also wanted him either to come with me or on his own to cooperate with the House Committee on un-American Activities. Again, at this conversation, Mr. Lantz reiterated that he had long been out of sympathy with Communism and the Communist Party, but that he felt he could not cooperate with the House Committee on un-American Activities because it would involve what he called informing. I disputed the use of the word "informing." I said to Mr. Lantz that while testifying was certainly not a joyous task, I felt that when loyalties clashed, the higher loyalty had to take precedence; and in this case I felt that loyalty to friends had to give way to loyalty to our country and its urgent needs for security. This I felt involved cooperating with the House Committee on un-American Activities. SMr. Lantz simply did not agree with this, and the conversation ended.
Mr. WHEEER. Mr. Rubin, have you ever been connected with the Writers' Congress?
Mr. RUBIN. To the best of my knowledge, no. Now, I know that in the list of items that the studio gave me, as charged against me, there was one which stated that I was part of a panel on training films, sponsored by the Communist Party front, the Writers' Congress, in 1943. My first reaction to this was that I had no recollection of it whatsoever. I then proceeded to check the item. I called Professor McGowan's office at UCLA, when I learned that that was where the congress was held, and I was informed by that office that as my name did not appear on the list of speakers, apparently I did not participate. I then checked it even further, and I discovered that I could not have participated in this congress because at the time it was held I was at Army Air Forces Cadet School in Miami, Fla. Therefore, the item is wrong.
Mr. WHEELER. A directory issued by the People's Educational Center for the winter term of 1947 lists you as an instructor. Is that correct? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. RuBIN. Yes; that is correct. 919 I did instruct for one semester at the People's Educational Center.
Mr. WHEELER. Who asked you Give the story. 
Mr. RUBIN. I was asked to instruct on the craft of writing screen plays by a screen writer named Robert Lees. This invitation came by a phone call, in which I asked Mr. Lees what the People's Educational Center, of which I had never heard, was. He told me that it was essentially a night school for adults who could not afford regular professional school tuition, and asked if I would donate my services in teaching screen writing. I agreed to do this. Never at any time in the conversation with Mr. Lees or subsequently at the school itself was the subject of the Communist Party mentioned or brought up, or was any discussion of communism itself ever conducted in my presence. I don't know what the other instructors or other classes talked about. I do very definitely know that in my classroom we talked simply about the craft of writing motion picture screen plays. I had no knowledge at the time that the People's Educational Center was in any way connected with the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know that it was known as the Los Angeles Labor School prior to the time it became the People's Educational Center?
Mr. REuBI. No; I did not. I have never heard that name before.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you quit? 
Mr. RUBIN. When the sponsorship of the People's Educational Center came into question, and when I saw for the first time that it was linked with the Communist Party, then I left the school and refused to teach there another semester. I have never had any conversation or association with anybody connected with it since.
Mr. WHEELER. According to the People's World, page 5, May 12, 1949, it lists you as a speaker before the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions. Is it true that you spoke at this meeting ?
Mr. RuBIN. I had no recollection of speaking at this meeting. But since I checked at the UCLA library, the People's World edition that reported this incident, and since I find they have words put in my mouth, I must assume that I did speak there. This was when?
Mr. WHEELER. May 12, 1949, as reported in the People's World.
Mr. RumIN. At that time I was a producer of the very first nationally sponsored TV film show, and TV itself was the hottest subject in show business. I recall being asked all the time to appear, for example, at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences meeting, to tell to other people interested in this growing industry my experiences as a socalled pioneer in TV. I accepted several of these invitations, because I was anxious to publicize my own work and my American Tobacco Co. show. In checking the People's World at the UCLA library, I noticed that according to them what I said at this meeting was to argue in favor of the importance of sponsorship and network backing in the making of television shows. 920 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. In other words, private enterprise?
Mr. RUBIN. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever a member of this organization? 
Mr. RUBIN. I didn't know, and my attorney, Mr. Gang, asked me to check my records on this. I went over them very thoroughly. I could find no evidence of having belonged to this organization nor could I find any evidence of having belonged to organizations which I now know were either stemmed out of this group or were affiliated with it, namely, the Progressive Citizens of America and the Independent Progressive Party.
Mr. WHEELER. You have submitted to the committee the list of your donations from 1946 through 1952. I notice in 1948 a contribution of $3 to the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of Arts, Sciences, and Professions. Would this be a contribution or perhaps could it be a payment of dues for membership ?
Mr. RUBIN. I can't answer that. I made every effort to check this particular list of donations, including the effort of tracking down and talking to the current office of the above organization. The only answer they would give me was that all records had been destroyed and they could give me no information. I am at a loss to specifically identify that $3 donation.
Mr. WHEELER. According to our information, Mr. Rubin, you signed the amicus curiae brief on behalf of John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo. Is that correct?
Mr. RUBIN. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who listed your signature?
Mr. RUBIN. No; I do not. Petitions of that nature were circulated at luncheon tables in the commissary or passed from office to office at the studio.
Mr. WHEELER. During that time, what was your position in regard to the indictment and conviction of Lawson and Trumbo following their contempt citations before the House Committee on Un-American Activities ?
Mr. RUBIN. I did not agree in any way whatsoever with the political viewpoint of these men under indictment for contempt. But I signed the amicus curiae brief because it was my understanding that signing it did not mean you had to be in sympathy with the political views of the men involved. To me, signing it was simply an American act of signing a document concerned with getting these men as complete and thorough a hearing as possible.
Mr. WHEELE. Do you recall signing the nominating petition on behalf of Albert Maltz for the executive board of the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. RUBIN. I do not recall signing this petition. But because it was listed again among the items charged against me, I contacted the Screen Writers' Guild and I was told by the guild that my name does appear on the Maltz' petition, dated October 1949.
Mr. WHEELER. This, I believe, was after the conviction of Albert Maltz for contempt of Congress. It was quite evident that during that period of time in 1949 that Mr. Maltz had been a member of the Communist Party. Were you in accord with having a member of the Communist Party on the executive board of the Screen Writers' Guild? COM1VIUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 921 
Mr. RuIN. . No; I was not. But I was in accord with the idea that the guild itself ought to vote on this, and that the best way for the guild to vote on it was by putting Mr. Maltz' name up. I felt this was something that should come up on the guild floor and be discussed and recognized.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your present-day attitude regarding the Communist Party ?
Mr. RuBIN. The same as it was when I left the study group in 1942. I started attending the study group because I was totally ignorant of the Communist Party. In very short order I learned enough about it to disagree and to disapprove of it thoroughly. My learning on the subject since, my knowledge through the newspapers of Soviet Russia's conduct in world affairs since, its aggressive nature and the ludicrous switches of American Communists, as identified in the newspapers, as they swing to and fro with the thoughts and activities of Soviet Russia, all of these things have only further substantiated the judgment I made in 1942.
Mr. WHEELER. We have just discussed what might be termed as a front record. Do you believe that this front record of yours indicates sympathy with the Communist movement?
Mr. R BIN. No, I do not. I believe-and in my own mind I know-that these items have grown out of a natural liberal instinct inside myself, an instinct which always sought fair play and equality of opportunity. I never knowingly participated in any group which was Communist or Communist front. But I must assume, from things which I have learned about things I signed or groups I occasionally worked with, that my very liberal instincts made me usable to these groups. And these groups I now know are Communists.
Mr. WHEELER. I would like for the record to show that Mr. Rubin has made available to the committee his contributions or donations from 1946 through 1952. This list discloses 68 separate contributions to various organizations and only one organization cited is a Communist front. This organization we have previously discussed, which is the Hollywood Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions.
Mr. Rubin, do you have anything else you would like to say for the record?
Mr. REBIN. Mr. Wheeler, I have given a copy of my sworn statement to you and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to my employer. I can only state to you, as I advised my employer and the FBI, that I am not now and never have been a member of the Communist Party, and that I am ready to answer any questions at all times. Any time you desire my cooperation, I will make myself available.
Mr. WHEELER. All right, Mr. Rubin. The committee will be most interested in what you have said here today. (Whereupon the interrogation of Stanley Rubin was concluded.) 31747-53-pt. 5-- INVESTIGATION OF-COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT 1 An executive statement given at 11:45 a. m., March 12, 1953, at room 1109, Statler Hotel, Los Angeles, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. TESTIMONY OF SOL SHORT
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state your full name?
Mr. SHOR. Sol Shor.
Mr. WHEELER. VWhen and where were you born?
Mr. Siron. In New York City, July 16, 1913.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your educational background?
Mr. SHOR. I was educated in the public schools in New York and went to the College of the City of New York at night for about two and a half years and then went to New York University, from which school I graduated in 1937.
Mr. WHIEELER. What is your present occupation?
Mr. SHOR. I am a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. How have you been employed since your graduation from New York University?
Mr. SHOR. I moved from New York to California with my family in 1937. First I got a job on the back lot at Republic Pictures and later became a writer, and since then have been working as a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. What are your screen credits ?
Mr. SHOR. Mainly at Republic Pictures and Columbia Pictures. The titles are mainly serial titles, like Dick Tracy, the Lone Ranger, Zoro.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently employed ?
Mr. SHOR. No; I am working on a free-lance basis now.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I have.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first join the Communist Party ?
Mr. SHOR. I believe that it was sometime in 1938. a Released by the committee. SSol Shor was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 924 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. What were the events leading up to your member- ship?
Mr. SHOR. I believe that I became interested in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League during that period, and somehow through my attendance at meetings there I was induced to attend a group in current events. I don't remember whether this was a pay group or not. From there I went to a group that was to prepare for recruiting into the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Who solicited your membership into the Communist Party, do you recall?
Mr. SHOR. Well, as I recall, there was one person I knew at that time by the name of Michael Alexander, and I think he was the one that got me to take this current events class.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was Michael Alexander?
Mr. SnoR. He was working either as a cutter or assistant cutter or in the messenger department at Republic Pictures at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, was he known to you as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. No.
Mr. WHEELER. But he did suggest that you attend theMr. SHOR. Current events from which the recruitments were made for this other group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Alexander attend the current events group or the study group ?
Mr. SHOR. No, he didn't.
Mr. WHEELER. However, he did make arrangements for you to attend?
Mr. SHOR. No, he just suggested this current events group, since I was apparently interested in world affairs, through my interest in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.
Mr. WHEELER. But still he would be the individual who made arrangements for you to attend, isn't that correct?
Mr. SHoR. Actually, I am trying to recall now what procedure took place for the enrollment, whether he was actually the one that enrolled me or whether he just suggested this group that met, this current events group.
Mr. WHEELER. He would have to suggest you see somebody in this group to get you started ?
Mr. SHOR. That is right, in this current events group.
Mr. WHEELER. Therefore, he would be instrumental in getting you into the group.
Mr. SHOR. Yes. Actually, as I say, I don't know whether he was an official in this current events or group or not at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Now, how many meetings did you attend of this current events group? Approximately.
Mr. SHOR. I should imagine it was about a dozen meetings. It was a complete course, sort of, that went over a period of about 3 months. As well as I can recall, we used to meet one evening a week.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where the meetings were held?
Mr. SHOR. They were held at various people's houses, but right now I don't think I can recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the individuals who attended these discussion groups? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 925 
Mr. SHOR. This is really very vague in my mind.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party while you attended this discussion group ?
Mr. SHOE. No. This was kind of a preliminary paving of the way, apparently, for indoctrination into the second group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructor was of this group?
Mr. SHOR. I remember the instructor of the second group was a Sam Silver. But this first groupMr. WHEELER. How long after you became a member of the discussion group were you asked to become a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOn. Then I went into this preliminary group that made possible my entrance into the Communist Party. And I attended meetings at this group which Sam Silver was an instructor of for about 12 weeks.
Mr. WHEELER. What I am trying to get at is when you joined the party.
Mr. SHOR. This was at the end of the second group.
Mr. WHEELER. At the end of the second group ?
Mr. SHOR. That is right. That also lasted about 10 or 12 meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Sam Silver as being the discussion leader in the second group?
Mr. SHOE. In the second group.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, how many individuals comprised the second group?
Mr. SHOR. I imagine there must have been between 8 and 10 in that second group.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party when you attended the second group ?
Mr. SHORT. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the individuals who attended this second group with you?
Mr.SHoR. I remember it was held at the house of Blanche Cole. I believe she is a sister of Lester Cole.
Mr. WHEELER. Lester Cole?
Mr. SHOR. Lester Cole.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Lester Cole present?
Mr. SHORT. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was present ?
Mr. SHOR. It is sort of a blank right there, because I don't remember any of these people being in any group I went into later on.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Now, you have stated at the conclusion of your attendance of the second discussion group you became a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. SHOR. Yes, at the last meeting the pitch was made, asking those who wanted to join to join up.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was instrumental in soliciting your membership in the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Well, it came as a result of this Sam Silver, who was the instructor. Actually, he was the one who made the pitch at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. At this time you signed up as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. That is right, at the end of this second discussion group. 926 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall anyone else who signed up as a member of the Communist Party at the same time you did.
Mr. SHOE. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you subsequently assigned to a group of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this first group ?
Mr. SHOR. Well, this first group, I remember I attended one big meeting where there were a lot of people whom I didn't know, since this was brand new to me, and immediately after this first meeting I was moved into a very small group, consisting of about 5 or 6 people.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the first group ?
Mr. SHOR. That must have been about maybe a year.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, do you recall the names of the individuals who were members of this first group ?
Mr. SHOR. There were the two people. Lillian-he is a business manager now.
Mr. WHEELER. IS it Lillian and Bernard Skadron?
Mr. SHOR. That is right. There was a girl of Finnish descent in the group, whose name I do not know. Harold Salemson.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of this group?
Mr. SHOE. No, I don't think I can. I don't think I can call the sixth person. But these 4 I remember definitely as part of the group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was the head of this group, the chairman?
Mr. SHOR. I think it was Lillian, either Lillian or Bernie Skadron.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay dues?
Mr. SHOR. At that time I did, yes; I did pay dues.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. SHOE. I may have paid them to Bernie Skadron.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this group classified as a motion-picture industry group, a talent group, or more or less a neighborhood group?
Mr. SHOR. I don't know whether they classified it at that time, because I was the only writer in the group. Mrs. Skadron, I think, was a housewife at the time, Lillian Skadron. Bernie Skadron was an accountant, I believe. Harold Salemson was a representative of magazines, as far as I could remember, publicity or a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. On how many occasions would you say you saw
Mr. Salemson present at these Communist Party meetings?
Mr. SHOR. He wasn't too regular an attendant. We used to meet sometimes once every week and sometimes once every second week, and I imagine he would be there, oh, about 50 percent of the time.
Mr. WHEELER. He was, however, a dues-paying member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I imagine he was.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, were you subsequently transferred to a second group?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I was.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you give us the approximate date?
Mr. SHOR. Let's see, I joined sometime in 1938. This lasted through 1939, and it must have been possibly sometime in 1939 that COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 927 I was transferred to a second group. This I believe was considered more of a talent group.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the second group?
Mr. SHOR. I believe I was a member of the second group for about 6 months and then went into a third group before I went into the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. On what date did you enter the United States Army?
Mr. SnHO. Pearl Harbor was December 1941. I was inducted in February of 1941. About 10 months before Pearl Harbor.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were members of the second group?
Mr. SHOR. The second group-there was, I think, Salemson was a part of this second group also. There was Edward Eliscu. I am trying to separate the second and the third groups. I think Mickey Uris was in this group. There may have been Morton Grant in this group at that time. I remember the third group more clearly because that was closest to my entrance in the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. How many members would you say were in the second group ?
Mr. SHOR. I imagine about 10 that I saw at various times.
Mr. WHEELER. Were they all writers in the motion-picture industry?
Mr. SHOR. I should imagine that all of them were writers, that this 'was purely a writers' group at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall who was the chairman of this group ?
Mr. SHOR. No, I don't think I could.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. SHOR. I know it wasn't Eliscu. My memory on that is not too clear.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, prior to your entrance in the Army, you say you were in a third group?
Mr. SHOR. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members of the third group were? 
Mr. SHOR. Yes. In the third group there was Lester Koenig. There was a Nicholas Bela. I believe Eliscu was also a member of this group. A fellow by the name of Rivers, I believe-he didn't work in pictures. I think he was a novelist.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that be W. L. Rivers, or Les Rivers?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, Les Rivers. I believe Mortimer Offner was a member of this group.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the total number of individuals in this group?
Mr. SHOR. I think that was about the biggest group I attended. I think there were about 12, I would imagine. Now, there was one I ran across, a Trivers, Paul Trivers. I recall the name. A tall, darkhaired fellow. I don't remember whether he was in the third group or the second one.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the chairman was of the third group?
Mr. SHOR. The chairman of the third group I believe was this Nicholas Bela.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues? 928 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SHOR. It may have been his wife, who was also a member of that group. She was a housewife or she may have been a writer, I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her given name
Mr. SHOR. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Were the wives of any of the other individuals you mentioned in the groups?
Mr. SHOR. No, just this Nicholas Bela's wife. Maybe it is because we used to meet at his house occasionally-not occasionally. I think most of the time this group met at his house in Westwood some place.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified you entered the Army in February of 1941.
Mr. SHOR. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you discharged from the Army?
Mr. SHOR. The end of October in 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you receive an honorable discharge?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, I did.
Mr. WHEELER. What branch of service were you in?
Mr. SHOR. I was in the Signal Corps, United States Army.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you stationed?
Mr. SHOR. When I was first inducted as a private I was stationed at Fort Francis E. Warren in Cheyenne, Wyo., with the Quartermaster Corps, where I was assistant to the public relations director of the pst. Then on orders from Washington I was transferred to Fort Monmouth Motion Picture Division. I remained with the motion picture division after it had moved to Astoria, Long Island.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your rank at the time of discharge?
Mr. SHOR. I was a first lieutenant. I went to the Signal Corps Officer Cadet School at Fort Monmouth, where I secured my commission.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you still retain a commission with the United States Army ?
Mr. SHOR. No, I am on the Inactive Reserves.
Mr. WHEELER. But you still have your commission?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, that remains with me.
Mr. WHEELER. After you were released from the Army, did you return to Hollywood?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I returned to Hollywood in November of 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. While you were in the United States Army, did you participate in any Communist activities?
Mr. SHOR. No, I didn't.
Mr. WHEELER. After your return to Hollywood, did you renew your affiliation with the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes. It was in around 1946, I believe, when I rejoined the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the mechanics involved in your reaffiliation with the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Let's see, it was through OffnerMr. WHEELER. Mortimer Offner?
Mr. SHOR. Yes that I was again reintroduced or sort of reattached to a group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Offner contact you personally?
Mr. SHOR. I think it was a kind of a mutual thing.
Mr. WHEELER. However, through Mr. Offner you were reassigned to another group in the Communist Party? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 929 
Mr. SHOR. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. This would be the fourth group ?
Mr. SHOR. That is correct. 
Mr. WHEELER. Whas this a group comprised of so-called talent group in Hollywood?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, this was again mainly writers.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the fourth group?
Mr. SHOR. I was a member of the fourth group until I moved to the valley, where I purchased a home.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you give us the approximate date?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, this was through the year of '46, and I moved to my new home in February of '47.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were members of this fourth group ?
Mr. SHOR. In the fourth group there was Michael Wilson, Herbert Biberman, I believe Carl Foreman, a fellow by the name of White.
Mr. WHEELER. Could that be Irving White'? 
Mr. SHOR. Irving White. Ray Spencer. That reminds me, Ray Spencer was somebody whom I had known as a member of one of the groups previously.
Mr. WHEELER. What is Mr. Spencer's occupation?
Mr. SHOR. I believe he was a writer. I believe Mickey Uris was a member of this group, and Bernard Vorhaus. Paul Trivers may have been in this group, also.
Mr. WHEELER. You did know Paul Trivers as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Prior to my entrance into the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the total number of members in this group?
Mr. SHoR. The most I saw at any one meeting were about, I think, between 9 and 10.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was the head of this group, the chairman?
Mr. SHOR. The chairman of this group I think shifted between Biberman and Mike Wilson.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. SHOR. It may have been Irving White.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, you have testified that in February 1947 you changed your residence.
Mr. SHOR. That is correct. 
Mr. WHEELER. And because of this change of residence you were assigned to another group.
Mr. SHOR. In the valley.
Mr. WHEELER. In the San Fernando Valley ? 
Mr. SHOR. Yes, that is right. In North Hollywood, that is.
Mr. WHEELER. This would be a different group of which you were a member?
Mr. SHOR. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you remain a member of the fifth group?
Mr. SHOR. I remained a member of it until my disassociation from the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. When was your disassociation? 930 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SHOE. Well, I could say that spiritually my disassociation started somewhere in 1948. And either toward the end of '48 or early '49 I physically separated myself from the party. To explain this a little more fully, I began to attend fewer and fewer meetings during the period of '48, because I had begun to have this fight within myself with regard to my attachment.
Mr. WHEELER. We will go into that in just a minute. Do you recall who the members of the fifth group were?
Mr. SHOR. Yes. The fifth group I believe was about the largest group I was a member of, and it later split up into 2 groups. It was still apparently the same group. In the fifth group there were Lester Cole, John Howard Lawson, I remember at the first few meetings of this large group, a fellow by the name of ManoffMr. WHEELER. Arnold Manoff?
Mr. SHOR. Arnie Manoff, that sounds right. Morton Grant, Al Levitt, Carl Foreman, and Mortimer Offner. Sanford-Mr. WHEELER. John Sanford?
Mr. SHOR. John Sanford. Betty Wilson, Melvin Levy.
Mr. WHEELER. John Weber?
Mr. SHOR. No. If I recall in our last interview I believe I said John Weber, but it was his wife that belonged to this group. John Weber was not part of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall John Weber's wife's given name?
Mr. SHOE. Ruth, I believe. George Beck was a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mrs. Beck a member of that group?
Mr. SHOE. I don't recall having seen her at any meetings. I believe we met at his house once or twice very early in that time, that I was transferred to that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Leopold Atlas a member of this group?
Mr. SHoR. Leopold Atlas I remember seeing at either 1 or 2 meetings very early in my attachment to that group. After those 1 or 2 meetings I never saw him again. Anne Froelich was a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall anyone else?
Mr. SHOR. Tom Chapman was a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Tom Chapman's occupation?
Mr. SHOE. I believe he was a reader. Just going back, this goes, way back. There was a director Tuttle, Frank Tuttle. This was back in, I believe, the second group that I was a member of. I remember Henry Meyers, a writer, as a member of the Communist Party, who was in one of the groups prior to my entrance in the Army. Ring Lardner, Jr. That was prior to my entrance in the Army. Hugo Butler was in one of the groups after I came out of the Army, in that first group. Maurice Rapf was before I went into the Army. I remember him in one of the groups prior to my entrance in the Army. Waldo Salt, that was prior to my entrance in the Army. There is a name I recall, Madelaine Ruthven, not as a member of the Communist Party but as either an assistant or one who was directly responsible for my signing the card initially from that second discussion group. I recall Jessie Burns as being in one of the discussion groups just prior to my entrance in the Communist Party. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 931 Clarice Chapman was in the last group, which I have called the Valley group.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you further identify Clarice Chapman?
Mr. SHOR. I believe she is the wife of Tom Chapman.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she employed in the motion-picture industry or was she typified as a housewife?
Mr. SHOE. I don't believe she was employed in pictures at the time. There is a name that rings a bell and I think this is part of the first group that I ever attended. There was a George, I believe it was George Hellgren, and I think he went back to Sweden or something.
Mr. WHEELER. George Hellgren was in one of your earlier groups? 
Mr. SHOR. The first one. early meetings. He was only there for a couple of the 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Mr. Hellgren's occupation? 
Mr. SHOR. It wasn't in motion pictures, I don't believe. 
Mr. WHEELER. I believe Mr. Hellgren was credit manager at Fox Studios. Does that refresh your memory?
Mr. SHOE. He may have been in some kind of business end of it.
Mr. WHEELER. His wife's name is Nora Hellgren. 
Mr. SHOR. There is a Nora Hellgren listed right under here. Are they Swedish?
Mr. WHEELER. I don't know. 
Mr. SHOE. Somehow I vaguely recall they went back to live in Sweden.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Nora Hellgren a member of this group?
Mr. SHOR. No; it was just George. That may have been the other person in that first group. Josef Mischel was a member, I believe, of the group I was in after I came back from the Army. Here is a name I recall. Dorothy Comingore, but not as a member of the Communist Party, but a member of the first study group I was in. It may have been at that time Dick Collins was also a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Dorothy Comingore was known to you as Dick Col- lins' wife ?
Mr. SHOR. I don't know whether they were married at that time or not.
Mr. WHEELER. They were subsequently married ? 
Mr. SHOE. Yes. In the last group there was a David Robison. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Mr. Robison's occupation? 
Mr. SHOE. I don't recall whether he was a reader at the time or a writer. Maurice Clark is one of the names I recall as being in the group I went into after I came out of the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. The first group you went into after you got out of the Army?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Shor, would you advise the committee the rea- sons why you severed your relationship with the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOE. Well, when I came out of the Army, and probably the thing that brought me back into it was perhaps the still idealistic interest and hope that maybe this was the right answer to the things that I though were politically and socially inequitable in the country at the time. 932 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA However, after a year in which I found that I was ordered to adhere to certain things, that is, if I disagreed, my disagreement meant nothing-in other words, you had to succumb to the general trend of thought and policy of the Communist Party as dictated from somewhere up above, and that to me absolutely ran against the grain. I felt that all the things that were being said about the Communist Party were more and more true, that it was more the tail of a kite that was flown somewhere in Moscow and this was just another appendage of it. It wasn't American in any sense of the term. It wasn't a truly free third party in the tradition of American third parties. My feeling was that since-such an overwhelming majority of the people, including many leading, honorable citizens of the country, felt this party was not for the best interests of the American people, that these doubts that began to assail me finally crystallized, that this S party was inequitable to the best interest of the American people and was inequitable to the democratic tradition of the American people, and it was something I didn't want to be associated with any longer and I felt any of my associations in the past had been a grave error, a mistake in thinking, probably thinking in which I was led by the nose by others without trying to think things out for myself.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall in 1939 Stalin and Hitler entered into a pact, a nonaggression pact?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I do.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe from your previous testimony you stated one of the reasons you joined the Communist Party was because of your interest in fighting nazism.
Mr. SHOR. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you accept the Stalin-Hitler pact?
Mr. SHOR. As best I can recall, this was a great shock to me, but as I say, at that time my thinking was dominated by others. And even though I remember at the time trying to argue against this feeling that it wasn't right, that making an alliance with nazism at the time was merely aiding nazism. However, the thinking of the other people in the group that I was associated with and the thoughts which dominated were that this was the best interest for peace, and so on and so forth. I finally succumbed and fell into line and accepted this, even though my better judgment said to me that this couldn't be so at the time, that this wasn't right.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you in the Army at the time Browder was expelled from the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. I believe I was. It was the period of the disclosure or the writing of the letter by Duclos, which made world history at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, were you ready to accept the Duclos letter?
Mr. SI-IR. Perhaps this is one of the things, even though when I returned from the Army and I reentered the Communist Party, I think this is one of the things that subconsciously remained with me more than anything else. It showed that the Communist Party was not acting as an American entity. It wasn't acting as a third party in the democratic tradition of the United States. It was merely acting as part of a world Communist group and merely accepting orders and dictates of people who are higher up in the, I should say, COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE ,LOS ANGELES AREA 933 hierarchy of the Communist Party; that is, the world Communist Party, if such a thing exists.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party when Albert Maltz wrote his article for New Masses, wherein he appealed for freer expression among writers?
Mr. SInn. I remember there was a great stir about this. Truthfully, this was a little above my level of understanding, the ramifications of what was good Marxist writing and what wasn't good Marxist writing. I recall that there was some discussion about this, but truthfully I could not fathom exactly what this was. Again, I think this is something that gave me the feeling that the man, if he was a member of the Communist Party, couldn't express himself in his own way, but had to follow a line that -was dictated from somewhere above and that if he failed to follow this line he wasn't writing the way a good Communist should be writing.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, during the time you were a member of the Communist Party, did you ever make an attempt to introduce into scripts any Communist Party line or doctrine ?
Mr. SHOR. Well, I think from the kind of material I wrote, mainly blood and thunder thrillers, there was very little opportunity, even if I had wanted to, to introduce any Communist ideology. I don't think I was well enough versed in it myself to be able to introduce any, and my feeling was to do as good a job on a picture as I possibly could and that was it. Additionally, I would like to add this; that those first years that I worked at Republic Studios I worked in a group with 2 or 3 other writers, and anything that I worked on was a collaborating effort, and certainly I didn't use any story ideas to try to influence these other writers.
Mr. WHEELER. Who have your agents been since you have been a writer in the motion-picture industry ?
Mr. SHOR. At the present time my agent is the Jaffee Agency. Before then it was Mitchell Gertz Agency. And those were the only two.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you feel that your membership in the Communist Party assisted you in any way in your writing profession? I mean, in regard to securing employment in the studios.
Mr. SHOR. No, it didn't, as far as I know, because my first job I secured at Republic Studios after working on the back lot. There was this opening, and I had been around pestering the producers, and finally secured a job on the serial staff of writers, and I worked on the serial staff until I was inducted into the Army. After I came out of the Army I went back to work at Republic Studios again and I never secured any help of any of these people that I knew in the Communist Party in any way whatsoever to help me secure employment.
Mr. WHEELER. IS there anything else, Mr. Shor, you would like to add to the record?
Mr. SHOR. Well, I would like to add this: Since my disassociation from the Communist Party I feel much freer, as though a burden were taken off of my mind, because as I said, for some time the struggle had been going on within me, whether I was doing the right thing by still being attached to something that was so definitely opposed to American democratic tradition, and that having severed all connec- 934 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA tions and bonds with the Communist Party, I can think and conduct myself, I believe, more in the American tradition. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever have an occasion to meet Danny Dare, either as a member of the Communist Party or in study groups? 
Mr. SHOE. I believe Danny Dare was a man that I met in the second study group I was a part of, before I became a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, do you recall if he became a member of the Communist Party
Mr. SHOR. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know whether he became a member of the Communist Party. I never was in any group with him.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you acquainted with Harold Hecht?
Mr. SHOR. At present? I haven't seen him in many years.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, did you ever have an occasion to meet Harold Hecht as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, in the second group that I was in.
Mr. WHEELER. Again, what are the approximate dates of your membership in the second group?
Mr. SHOR. In the second group it was around 1939, the greater part of that.
Mr. WHEELER. How long a period of time did you say you were in the second group ?
Mr. SHOR. It must have been about a year, because then I was in the third group before I went into the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. On how many occasions would you say you saw Harold Hecht in attendance at these meetings?
Mr. SHOR. I imagine I saw him about 2 or 3 times at these meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. These were closed meetings of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, at the time, they were.
Mr. WHEELER. Everybody who attended these meetings were duespaying members?
Mr. SHOn. I imagine they were.
Mr. WHEELER. You were a dues-paying member ? 
Mr. SHOR. Yes, at that time, certainly.
Mr. WHEELER. You would reach the conclusion that the other individuals in attendance were dues-paying members ?
Mr. SHOE. Certainly.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions, Mr. Shor. If you have anything in addition you would like to add to the record, anything you can think of, you have the opportunity now of saying whatever you so desire.
Mr. SHOR. I believe I have covered it all. As I say, in regard to people and events, I have gone over the past to the best of my recollection, and as to my feelings now and in the future, I think I have expressed those as fully as I can.
Mr. WHEELER. I want to take this opportunity now of thanking you for your cooperation.
Mr. SHOR- Thank vou. Mr. Wheeler. (Whereupon the interrogation of Sol Shor was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT An executive statement given at 1: 45 p. m., March 12,1953, at room 1109, Statler Hotel, Los Angeles, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. TESTIMONY OF LEOPOLD LAWRENCE ATLAS 2 
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state your full name?
Mr. ATLAS. My full name is Leopold Lawrence Atlas.
Mr. WHEELER. When and where were you born?
Mr. ATLAS. October 19, 1907, in Brooklyn, N. Y.
Mr. WHEELER. Your present occupation.
Mr. ATLAS. Writer.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your educational background?
Mr. ATLAS. Public schools of Brooklyn, Boys High School of Brooklyn, Yale University School of Fine Arts. That was a graduate school. They gave me a special dispensation. We were supposed to have a college degree. I had written a play Professor Baker liked so much that they gave me a scholarship.
Mr. WHEELER. How have you been employed since leaving the university ?
Mr. ATLAS. I worked for the Brooklyn Eagle and shortly thereafter I sold a play, and after that I worked as a playwright independently, until I came out to Hollywood in 1942, I believe. In other words, I worked on my own completely at all times.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been employed in the motion-picture inindustry ?
Mr. ATLAS. Have I ever been employed?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Mr. ATLAS. Yes; I was employed in the motion-picture industry shortly after my first play was produced on Broadway. That was, I believe, in 1935. I remained in Hollywood for about 8 months and then returned east and received a Guggenheim Fellowship, and sat down and wrote another play which the Theater Guild purchased and produced. aa Released by the committee. Leopold Lawrence Atlas was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 936 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 'Since that time I have worked independently again, until the time I came out to Hollywood, once more, in 1942.
Mr. WHEELER. What screen credits do you have, Mr. Atlas?
Mr. ATLAS. Do you want them all the way down?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Mr. ATLAS. Well, Mystery of Edwin Drew in 1935. A Notorious Gentleman, Wednesday's Child, Story of G. I. Joe, Tomorrow the World, Her Kind of Man, Raw Deal. The name escapes me, but it was a screen play based on Carriage Entrance. Ava Gardner was in it, and Robert Mitchum.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Political Association?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. When did you become a member of this organization
Mr. ATLAS. It must have been-I am not very accurate on date, I must admit-in the latter part of 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. What led up to your membership in the Communist Political Association?
Mr. ATLAS. I was approached by 2 people on 2 occasions. One, George Willner, who was my agent then. The other, Lester Fuller, who was an old, old friend, also, way back from college. Do you want me to tell how I came to this town and the offers of friendship and all that ?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Mr. ATLAS. I came to Hollywood in 1942 and signed up with the Goldstone Agency, when they offered me a sum of money to work on an original story for them.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you sent to the Goldstone Agency by a particular individual or was the agency of your own choice?
Mr. ATLAS. There was a correspondence while I was back east between myself and Harold Hecht, in which he encouraged me to come out to Hollywood, that there probably would be opportunity for employment for me. Then he offered me a sum of money, I think it was something like $50 a week, through the Goldstone Agency, to write an original story. I was pretty bad off financially at the time and I accepted this and came out and became associated with the Goldstone Agency.
Mr. WHEELER. You previously knew Harold Hecht in New York?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes; I did. Harold Hecht I knew in 1935, when I came out here, and I think he was a dance director at that time, or something. When my play But For The Grace of God was produced, it was produced by the Theater Guild in conjunction with Sidney Harmon, we had our own stage manager. Then a curious situation arose. Benno Schneider was the director of the play, and attached to Benno Schneider was Harold Hecht, who claimed that he was Benno Schneider's stage manager. The truth of the matter is that our stage manager did all the work. What Harold did I don't know. And after the play closed I had no more relationship with Mr. Hecht in any way whatsoever, until this 1942 period.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mr. Hecht with the Willner Agency then?
Mr. ATLAS. At the time I came out? Yes. As a matter of fact, George Willner was Harold Hecht's assistant. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 937 
Mr. WHEELER. It was due to your prior relationship or acquaintance with Hecht that you became attached to the Willper Agency?
Mr. ATLAS. I would say in general that would be true; yes. Harold knew I had written plays, and all the rest of that, and knew my ability. In 1942 I was handled by Harold Hecht for a very short time and then by George Willner, whom I had never met or known before my arrival in Hollywood. I worked for a short period at Columbia and Republic Studios. Shortly thereafter, I think it was in 1943, I was rejected by the Army because of my physical condition. Feeling very strongly about the war, and wanting to aid in any possible way I could, I personally requested a Signal Corps assignment to make training films for the Army. These were made in Astoria, Long Island. Upon entering the Signal Corps I took the pledge of loyalty, and I am prepared to take a similar pledge now. My children pledge their allegiance every day in school, as I did when I was a child. I see no contradiction in taking an oath at any time in what I truly believe. Never for an instant have I swerved from my loyalty to my country. I returned to Hollywood after my assignment with the Signal Corns. There I met several people whom I had known back in my college and theater days. One of these friends offered to help me find a house. As you may recall, there was a great shortage at this time. This friend was Lester Fuller, who had gone to Yale with me, and at one time wanted to produce a play of mine, House We Live In. Let me state here I never knew of Lester Fuller's political convictions. In fact, I would have been astonished if he had any at all. He found a sublet for us from Lester Cole, who I had never met before or known before or ever heard of, nor did I know anything of his political convictions. The Coles were going to Oregon for about 4 months and sublet their house to us for $50 a month, which was half of what they were paying. Being busted, I naturally appreciated this. Shortly after, Mr. Fuller, who was a director at Paramount, recommended me for an assignment at that studio. I got the assignment. I naturally was grateful. Upon the Coles' return from Oregon, my wife, who was then pregnant with our first child, and I moved into a small apartment on Fountain Avenue. This was, I believe, early in 1944. One day while riding with my agent George Willner-who, I want to reiterate, I had never met before or known, or even heard of before I came to Hollywood-to an interview for an assignment, he broached me about joining a discussion group called the Communist Political Association. This request utterly astonished me. One, that George Willner was a Communist. Second, that I would even have been asked to join, in view of my very outspoken criticism of the party at various times. It is of prime significance to point out to the committee that I had been in Hollywood for 2 years before anyone approached me on the subject. It was only now that the Communist Party had evidently changed its spots, that they thought I would even listen to them. As a matter of fact, at a small gathering several days before, I had said openly that in my opinion Mr. Browder .was nothing more than a grocery clerk. When I mentioned this statement again, Mr. Willner 31747-53-pt. 5-- 938 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA smiled and said it had been reported back to him but that it didn't matter. The Communist Party, he told me, had completely dissolved itself. It was now completely nonpolitical and was now merely going to be a discussion rooup.
Mr. WHEELER. 15o you recall anything additional in your conversation with Mr. Willner, at this time?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes. I recall saying to Mr. Willner that I didn't see eye to eye with his group on many issues. Again he reassured me that it didn't matter, that on the major premises of winning the war and working within the two-party system we were agreed.
Mr. WHEELER. What issues did you disagree on?
Mr. ATLAS. I told him that I could under no circumstances join any organization unless I had assurances on three premises.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what these three premises were?
Mr. ATLAS. These premises were: 1. That this organization no longer had any connection with the Communist Party whatsoever; 2. That it had no link with any foreign country; 3. That I refused at any time and all times to subject myself to disciplinary action of any kind, mental or physical or spiritual.
Mr. WHEELER. Did he give you any assurances?
Mr. ATLAs. He gave me these assurances, but I was not entirely satisfied. I was still skeptical and wary. I requested that I receive the same assurances from as high an official in the association as possible.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you subsequently contact a high functionary in the party, in regard to the assurances you requested?
Mr. ATLAS. I did, or, rather, they did in the following manner: I was then asked to come to a social gathering at Ben Barzman's house, where John Howard Lawson was to talk. Lester Fuller also invited me to this gathering.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what Mr. Lawson said that particular evening?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes. I went to the gathering. John Howard Lawson gave a talk which concerned itself with the necessity of all elements in our country to unite in a win-the-war effort. This I devoutly and ferverently believed in.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you subsequently asked to join the Communist Political Association ?
Mr. ATLAs. At the close of his talk I was invited by Lawson to join the Communist Political Association. Not a political party, mind you, but a discussion group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you discuss with Mr. Lawson the conditions on which you would join the Communist Party?
Mr. ATLAs. Yes. I again demanded the three conditions I have already mentioned, and I was once more assured. As a matter of fact, another thing turned up in our talk in which I said I thought it would be a good thing for the poltitical association to study American history instead of constantly boring back into Russian history. And I was assured by Lawson that they were going to do that.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you have prior knowledge that Russian history was discussed by the Communist Political Association?
Mr. ATLAs. By hearsay. I had been around, I had gotten into arguments with them on any number of occasions. The discussions always referred back to Russian thought. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 939 May I add this: Having personally received these vital assurances from the top men in the association, I saw no harm in joining this discussion group or any other group following these principles. In fact, it was a bit of gratification to me that the Communist Party had been dissolved. I hoped the association, in its place, might now enter into the broad stream of American life and thought, which to my mind they had never done before. It was a further matter of gratification to me that they had departed from their position; not I to theirs. In other words, they had ostensibly come over to my way of liberal thinking. I also privately, and perhaps naively, in view of what took place later, hoped that I might inject my own liberal thought into the association and educate them at the same time that they were trying to educate me. I fully accepted John Howard Lawson's statement about the severance of the Communist Political Association from contact with any other foreign government. Many years later, after I was out of the Communist Political Association, during the period when the committee was conducting one of its investigations, I expected that at some time I might be contacted or identified, and I wondered how I could prove that these important assurances, which I demanded at the very beginning, were the only conditions under which I would join the association. I knew there were only three other people who knew about this. One was John Howard Lawson, one was George Willner, and the other was my wife. I was pretty certain that neither Lawson nor Willner would come and verify this statement, and I racked my brains for some verification of the early position I had taken, and suddenly it occurred to me-and I think this was sometime in 1950 or around there-to check in the Encyclopedia Britannica. In the yearbook of 1945, in their article on communism, page 203, there is the following revelatory statement: S* * in the United States the Communist Party became, on May 22, 1944, a Communist Political Association, with Earl Browder as its first president, who, in addressing the convention, used "ladies and gentlemen" instead of the former official greeting "comrades " The resolutions adopted deprecated class war and stressed national unity. I was all for that. All strikes in wartime we e violently opposed. I was in favor of that. During the elections the Communists in the United States supported Roosevelt. I was in favor of that. They affirmed their willingness to work within the traditional American system of two parties and of free enterprise. * * * On all of these accounts I was certainly in favor of all of these things. And here further was printed proof of the position I had taken at that time, and it gave me some gratification to have it reaffirmed.
Mr. WHEELER. From your testimony, Mr. Atlas, I believe the responsible people for getting you into the association were Lester Fuller, George Willner, and John Howard Lawson ?
Mr. ATLAs. Yes. As a matter of fact, Lester Fuller and George Willner had a big hassle about who was to get credit for getting me in. 940 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. It was actually a threefold effort?
Mr. ATLAs. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall signing a membership card for the Communist Political Association?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you explain where this took place and the circumstances involved ?
Mr. ATLAs. This took place at Mr. Barzman's house, in the den off the living room. I was asked to sign a card. I balked at this when I saw the card had the "Communist Party of America" on it. It was explained to me that they were still using the stationery of the party which bore the same initials as the association, as an economy measure. This sounded logical, and at that time I had no reason to doubt it. At the same time my wife joined the Communist Political Association, on the same conditions and terms as myself. She also, I believe, signed a card at the same time, and thereafter at all times we were members of the same groups and when we got out we got out together. Her position at this time is identical with mine.
Mr. WHEELER. After becoming a member of the Communist Political Association were you assigned to a group ?
Mr. ATLAs. Yes. I was assigned to a small neighborhood group in Hollywood and I was, frankly, more than a little contemptuous of many of the discussions and papers that were read there.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members of this group were?
Mr. ATLAS. I can only recall three members.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you identify them, please, for the record?
Mr. ATLAS. One was Vic Shapiro, who was the leader of that group, evidently.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Mr. Shapiro's occupation?
Mr. ATLAS. I believe he was in public relations. The others whom I recall were Gertrude Fuller, the wife of Lester Fuller, Bess Taffel, and Ann Morgan was in that group, too.
Mr. WHEELER. Is that Ann Roth Morgan?
Mr. ATLAs. Ann Roth Morgan.
Mr. VHEELER. She was secretary of the Screen Writers' Guild? 
Mr. ATLAS. Of the Screen Writers' Guild at the time; yes.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this first unit ?
Mr. ATLAs. Not very long. I would say no more than a month at the outside, I don't think, when the entire thing was reorganized.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the chairman of this group was, the first group ?
Mr. ATLAs. To the best of my knowledge, Vic Shapiro.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. ATLAS. No. In the first group, no. I don't know whether I paid dues.
Mr. WHEELER. You were subsequently transferred to a second group?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes, which was to be a craft group, a Hollywood craft group.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you in the second group ?
Mr. ATLAS. I can't be exact about this. I would say about 3 or 4wait a minute. I can be exact. It couldn't have been more than a month or two at the outside. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 941 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember how many individuals were in this group?
Mr. ATLAS. I only recall three of the Hollywood craft. Lester Cole, Albert Maltz, and Gordon Kahn.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the leaders of this second group were?
Mr. ATLAS. No; but an ironic situation occurred at that time. They wanted to elect me leader of the group and I said I didn't know enough about what was going on to be a leader yet. Who the leader was, I don't recall. I recall who the treasurer was: Albert Maltz.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, you were subsequently transferred to a third group, is that correct?
Mr. ATLAS. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you remain in the third group ?
Mr. ATLAS. Now, the third group took a long time organizing itself, first of all. Exactly when it did become organized, I don't recall. But when it did become organized, I became a member of that third group, and I left them in 1947, to the best of my recollection.
Mr. WHEELER. Well now, who were the members of the third group ?
Mr. ATLAS. John Howard Lawson, Lester Cole, Johnny Cole, Arnold Manoff, Alfred Levitt, John Sanford, Maggie Roberts, who was the wife of John Sanford. May I say she came to the meetings very, very infrequently. Anne Green, Howard Koch's wife, Betty Wilson, Lewis Allen for a short period. Arthur Strawn for a short period. Alvah Bessie,
Mrs. Bessie, Tom Chapman, Mrs. Chapman.
Mr. WHEELER. IS her name Clarise?
Mr. ATLAs. Something like that. She is a stout dark woman. Yes, I would say Clarise is his wife. Mel Levy, Morton Grant, Betty Grant, and Anne Froelich.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the officers of the valley group?
Mr. ATLAS. There were various officers at various times. At one time John Howard Lawson, I believe, was one of the officers. Lester Cole was one of the officers. Arnold Manoff was one of the officers. Alfred Levitt was one of the officers.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you identify what office they held ?
Mr. ATLAS. No, I can't. I am terribly sorry. One was with 1 committee and 1 was with an educational committee; 1 went to the central committee, or something of that sort. My last recollection of the person who ran the meeting, or sort of officered the meeting, was Morton Grant. Also myself, I guess, as treasurer.
Mr. WHEELER. What office did you hold, Mr. Atlas.
Mr. ATLAS. I held the office of treasurer.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you collect dues from all the individuals you have identified?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. How much were the dues of this group, if you recall?
Mr. ATLAS. When I first joined the association the dues were, to the best of my recollection-and I must admit here that it is a bit hazy, it having been so long ago-a nominal $1 a month, if you were. employed, and 20 cents a month if unemployed. I was originally told also that I need not pay this if I were unable to do so or chose not to. Later-how much later I cannot recall-the entire organization 942 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA voted to assess itself voluntary contributions, based on a percentage of their earnings. Exactly what percentage this was, I do not now recall, but I do recall that it varied at times, that is, new systems at arriving at percentages were worked out. At one point it was, I believe, 4 percent of the net earnings. Several times this changed. This voluntary contribution was in addition to the so-called basic dues. On two occasions I was elected treasurer of the valley group, that is, I was elected once for a 6-months' term and then reelected to succeed myself. It was purely a functionary job. The only qualification was personal honesty and integrity. Evidently the valley group, despite what else they might have thought of me, knew I possessed these. Dues were collected once a month and in the following manner: To facilitate the business of the meetings, the treasurer early in the meetings retired to a separate room to make his collection. This was necessary, since almost every member had an individual dues problem which frequently required discussion and explanations, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, there was the working out of percentages, often rather complicated. And, secondly, many members frequently asked for a lowering of their voluntary contribution. This required further figuring and explanation. The treasurer had the personal discretionary power of permitting a lowering of the voluntary contribution. Many felt a distinct hardship in meeting their allotted sums. Some had family problems of various sorts, illnesses, new additions to the family, relatives to support, back debts, et cetera. In almost all cases I accepted a lowering u' the voluntary contribution, in view of personal hardships. Further, the entire system of voluntary contributions was based on a sort of tacit honor system, that is, each member stated what he or she earned and I accepted their word. There was no check-back, so. far as I knew, of the correctness of their statements. In return for their basic dues they were given a little gummed stamp, which many simply tore up. No stamp of any kind was given for the so-called voluntary contributions. As treasurer, I would have each member come in individually. Together we would compute his voluntary contribution or arrange for payment of arrears, a condition into which many had fallen. When that member left, he sent another member in to me. At the end of the collection of dues, which took at least an hour, and often longer, I would return to the meeting. Later in the week I would take whatever dues and contributions I had collected, along with an itemized account, and I would deposit those sums in the hands of Naomi Robeson at her home.
Mrs. Robeson was called the section treasurer, I believe. The sums of money varied in amounts according to the employment of the membership. To the best of my present recollection, it usually was several hundred dollars each month. What happened with these sums of money after I delivered them to Mrs. Robeson, I do not know. She, in turn, I believe, was required to turn over the collected sums to the community treasurer or county treasurer. At least I assumed so. My functional part in the transaction was over. At various times several of the members requested to know how the money was dis- COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 943 tributed. Notably Lester Cole, I recall. I made inquiries from Mrs. Robeson, on his behalf, but was always told that some day a report would be made. This report was given to me only on one occasion. It was a highly complex report, and to the best of my recollection it, in essence, indicated that moneys were divided percentagewise between the community, county, state, and national organizations. In what proportion I do not recall, nor do I recall that the specific uses this money was put to was ever stated. I am certain we all presumed it was utilized for organizational and operative expenses. I paid dues and voluntary contributions along with the rest. I felt that I was in honor bound to do so, since I requested the dues from the others. I recall only one general meeting of the treasurers of all the local clubs. This was held at the Robeson house. Its purpose, to the best of my recollection, was to explore more efficient methods of collections of dues and contributions, since many of the members were constantly in arrears. I don't think the meeting solved its problem. Club members were in arrears as long as I can recall. On the many occasions, when I absented myself from regular meetings, dues were collected for me by one of the other members; usually, I think Mrs. Morton Grant.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified that you gave stamps to the members of the club after you received dues from them. Do you recall from where you received the stamps
Mr. ATLAS. Yes; from Naomi Robeson.
Mr. WHEELER. You also testified that you attended a meeting at her home with treasurers of other units.
Mr. ATLAS. That is true. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the treasurers of the other units were that you met with?
Mr. ATLAS. No. There were units from all over, so far as I knew,
Mr. WHEELER. When did your disillusionment begin with the Communist Party?
Mr. ATLAS. After 6 months I knew definitely this was not for me. But how to get out was the question. By now I had insight into their methods of work. Without knowing exactly who the people were, I knew that many of the members were in strategic positions in the motion-picture industry. I had seen instances of it, such as Meta Reis in the Paramount story department, and Tom Chapman at Warner's, Ann Roth Morgan in the Screen Writers' Guild itself, and George Willner as an agent and a person who had been introduced to me as head reader at M. G. M. and whose name I cannot recall. From this I could infer that they were in many other strategic places.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you feel that the Communist Party had a great deal of influence in Hollywood?
Mr. ATLAS. I do. I do feel they were there. Where they were, I don't know. You have the feeling they were, though. I knew that if I had gotten out, these ruthless experts at character assassination would have tried to ruin me with no compunction whatsoever.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know of any example of character assassination of individuals whom the Communist Party was hostile to?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes, I had seen a perfect example of this a week or two after I had joined. A general meeting had been called of all the 944 : S S COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA writers in Hollywood. At this meeting, sqmeone-I believe it was Lawson-advised all members to be careful of a man named Herb Klein, that he was unrealiable, et cetera, et cetera. I waited for someone to defend Herb Kline, for I personally knew that he had recommended and gotten employment for at least three people there, namely, Guy Endore, Phil Stevenson, and Ben Bengal In fact, they were working very closely with Mr. Kline at the time. I was aghast when none of them had the common decency to stand up and say a good word for Mr. Kline; but none did. I was new to all this. I watched and observed and knew that if ever the occasion -occurred when I wanted to walk out that the same vicious, ruthless, underhanded treatment would be accorded me. So I remained. I was struggling to raise my small growing family, and in the final analysis if I were injuring anyone it was only myself. Furthermore, I had faith in my own independent integrity and believed I could maintain it despite all.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have any further instances which you can recall which further caused your disillusionment with the party?
Mr. ATLAs. As a second instance of corrupt and unethical practice that I found occurred on the screen play of GI Joe. Based on Ernie Pyle's books. I am very proud of the work I did on GI Joe. I wrote, I believe, 90 percent of it. The script was nominated for the Academy Award. It lost the Film Critics Award by only 1 vote, after 16 ballots, and I was told it was accepted as the official Infantry film by the United States Army. No one but a loyal American could have written it. Some of you may have seen the picture, and I think you will agree with me it was a fine film. I worked harder on this than I had ever worked in my life. In fact, on its completion I suffered a nervous and physical collapse from exhaustion and had to remain in bed for several days. But it was a splendid subject, one in which a writer could truly put his heart and soul into, and I did, holding back no reserve. When the time for the choice of credits came, however, Guy Endore and Phil Stevenson-two longtime members of the party and association-who had worked on a prior and unsuccessful script, demanded equal share m the accredited authorship of GI Joe. This to me was absurd. Finally the matter went to arbitration, and although it was acceeded that I had written approximately 80 percent of the script and the other 2, as a team, mind you, only 10 percent-the other 10 percent incorporated in the body and nature of the story itself-the arbitration committee, which was composed of Mary McCall, Jr., Richard Collins, and Dorothy Kingsley, decided that, despite the great disparity of contribution, all 3 names should be equally placed on the screen play. I was aghast at this decision, as were many other people connected with GI Joe. Specifically, Bill Wellman, the director, and Alan LeMay, who had worked on a still earlier version of the screen play. Being new to the industry, I demanded to know upon what rules this decision had been based, and was told there was no standardized rules in the matter of such credits. Approximately 4 months later Miss Alice Penneman, who was then executive secretary of the Screen Writers' Guild, unearthed a set of prior rules which indicated that unless a team of writers had done, I COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 945 believe, at least 30 percent of the writing, their names could not be placed on the screen play. Did the others withdraw their names then? No. Did the arbitration committee do anything about rectifying their error? No.
Miss Penneman was the only one who had the common decency to write me a note apologizing for the great injustice done me. I have a copy of that letter if the committee wishes to see it. Later, I understand, Mr. Richard Collins, whom I did not personally know then nor now, admitted to a friend of mine that before I got on the script there was no script at all. Perhaps he will be willing to corroborate that statement now. For any writer to accept credit for something he hadn't written was to me not only abhorent, but also an indication of a breakdown in moral and ethical principles. For this to happen among so-called progressive elements was doubly revelatory and shocking. On another occasion I remember getting into a controversy with John Howard Lawson on the merits of Brooks Atkinson's series of articles on the Russian theater. Mr. Atkinson had returned from Moscow to America and had written, in essence, that the Russian theater was sterile and decadent. Lawson attacked Atkinson as having become corrupt and probably senile. I have known Mr. Atkinson and his writings for a long time. I believe him and do at this moment to be a person of great honesty, understanding and integrity. I ardently stated that if Mr. Atkinson wrote what he did about the Russian theater it was probably true. For this heresy I was smiled upon as the group's pet "confused liberal." Now let's take up the Maltz' New Masses article affair. This was truly a ghastly business. Here one saw the wolfpack in full operation, working on one of their own long-term members. The mere recalling of the incident is abhorrent to me. Let me briefly sketch what took place. Mr. Maltz wrote an article in the New Masses in which he expressed, in essence, the belief that even non-Marxist writers could write truthfully and honestly, simple and short. It was no great shakes of an original thought. Many of us had subscribed to that idea even way back in our adolescence. And I believe the idea was abroad ever since man first began to write, that is, that shades of political thought had nothing to do with a man's ability to write truthfully. The key word here, of course, is "truthfully." But for a Communist, and one of long standing, to make the above concession was quite a step. When I heard of Maltz' article and read it, I was enormously pleased. This was not only a further indication to me that the Communist Political Association had honestly broken with the tenets of the Communist Party, but also that Albert Maltz, after long contemplation, had fought his way clear through to the liberal humanitarian way of thinking and writing. Albert and I worked at Warner's at the time and I recall going over to his office to congratulate him on the independent position he had taken. There was another chap named Arnold Manoff at Warner's at the time. I remember that he too agreed with the basic tenets of Maltz' article. A week later the roof fell in, and that is a very mild way of putting it. By his article, Maltz evidently had been guilty of some great 31747-53-pt 5-- 946 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA heresy, and the execution squad, shipped in from the East, came marching in. Some high muckamucks, whom I had never known, never heard of and whom to this day don't remember, came striding in on giant steps. This was the intellectual goon squad. A general meeting of all the writers was called at Abe Polonsky's house. Knowing that Maltz was in trouble, I was prepared to defend his position, despite the fact that I was sorely aware of my deficiencies as a public speaker. From this point on I can only give you my impressions of that meeting. It was a nightmarish and shameful experience. I remember that Albert tried to explain his thoughts on the article. I remember that almost instantly all sorts of howls went up in protest against it. I remember that I and one or two others made small attempts to speak in favor of Maltz, and we were literally shouted down. I think I remember seeing Leonardo Bercovici trying to defend the article. But the wolves were loose and you should have seen them. It was a spectacle for all time. Manoff, from whom I had expected some statement in defense, in view of his prior attitude, said nothing. From one corner Alvah Bessie, with bitter vituperation and venom, rose up and denounced Maltz. From another corner Herbert Biberman rose and spouted elaborate mouthfuls of nothing, his every accent dripping with hatred. Others from every part of the room jumped in on the kill. Aside from the merits of the article in question, this spectacle was appalling to me, for one simple reason. Maltz, I knew, was an associate of theirs of long standing. He was at that time a person of some literary stature and, as I then believed, a man of considerable personal integrity. The least one might have accorded him, even in disagreement, was some measure of understanding, some measure of consideration. But not they. They worked over him with every verbal fang and claw at their command; every ax and bludgeon, and they had plenty. They evidently were past masters at this sort of intellectual cannibalism. The meeting was finally adjourned, to be reconvened the next week at the same place. I firmly resolved in heart and mind that if at this next meeting Maltz decided to renounce them all and stick by his guns, I would be the first to follow him out. However, at the next meeting they completely broke him. The hyena attack-that is the only way I can describe them-continued with a rising snarl of triumph, and made him crawl and recant. This entire episode is an extremely distasteful thing for me to recall. I remember feeling a deep anguish for him as a human being, that his closest friends for years, or, at least associates, would treat him so shamefully, so uncaritably, so wolfishly. Whatever the cause, his friends had no right, in all decency, to humiliate and break him in this fashion. Or if they did they were not his friends. And whatever they stood for should have been proof eternal to him that they were wrong and evil. Maltz' martyrdom, if that is what it was, was false, sterile, and destructive. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 947 Further in that hour he betrayed not only himself and his justly derived thoughts, but also all those who had entered and remained in the organization, in a large measure, due to him. So long as he was there, one felt some good was there. A sense of justice to which one could always appeal. I say this was a deep sorrow for Albert, because I respected him. Many others, I believe, were as deeply shocked as myself; but none spoke of it. One lasting impression that I took away was that of a certain Nemmy Sparks, evidently a high muckamuck somewhere in the hierarchy. I recall the sneering look of contempt he had for all those present. His clamping, grindstone jaw . The personification of the commissar. Frankly, I could understand his contempt, for I felt it myself for other reasons. After this I knew positively that I had to get out. But how, I frankly didn't know. I believe I have already mentioned that they were placed in strategic positions throughout the industry. That withdrawal from them would have meant professional and economic suicide. I had already seen the utterly ruthless, unprincipled, cutthroat act of character assassination they had performed on Albert Maltz and others. There wasn't the slightest reason to believe they would not perform the same service to me. I had two little babies, one newly born and the other a 2-year-old child. I had to protect them at whatever cost to myself, though, as we will see later, and probably already know, despite all this, I did leave them voluntarily and of my own free will, accepting with certain knowledge retaliatory measures. I could no longer compromise with my principles.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your reaction to the Duclos letter?
Mr. ATLAS. Now let us take up the Duclos affair. It is true I remained in the organization after the Duclos affair. But, believe me, I didn't understand all its implications until much later, very much later; years after I left the organization. It was only then that I tied up the Duclos affair with the specific causes which led to a direct and final break. To me the Duclos affair was just another internecine war. Now, to understand this, you must remember there were internecine wars almost every week. There were, as you have probably learned from other testimony, constant organizing and reorganizing and counterorganizing of clubs. One week we were a neighborhood club and the next a craft club, and the following week something else again. And within these organizations if Lester Cole wasn't constantly trying to tear Lawson apart, Alvah Bessie was morosely clawing away at Cole, or Manoff would join in to work on both, while still a further newcomer from the East, Alfred Levitt, would take on all three. I recall this Levitt at one time demanding the expulsion of Cole, and for what reason I cannot now remember. It was indeed a spectacle to watch. Now, that was only in our "peaceful" group. There was the larger group of all writers which also was constantly in a state of flux and reorganization. At one time it was thought that writers ought to mingle more with "living" people and edicts went out that all groups 948 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA were to be reorganized so that the so-called common man could enter our clubs, that is, bookkeepers, machine workers, office personnel, housewives, et cetera. But this order was countermanded before it could be put into practice, for some unknown reason. Possibly contact with reality might have been too drastic. Further, at the larger meetings of writers, you would get experts from other groups axing away at experts from your clubs. Dalton Trumbo, a brilliant speaker, taking Lester Cole apart, piece by piece. Or Herbert Biberman, a sterile, pedantic speaker, hammering away at someone else. Or Polonsky, the fiery type, going into real oldfashioned Union Square soap box oratory. The only thing the Duclos affair meant to me was that here was another reorganization, probably on a larger scale, and that Earl Browder was out. Now, that was all right with me. You may remember my early opinion of Browder. This just meant that someone else was on top for the time being, and that probably the week after a third person would supersede him. The fourth week Browder would probably b back where he was, and the roundelay would continue over again. Everything else went on the same. The meetings went on the same. Dues were collected the same. Internecine feuds went on the same. Gobbledegook went on the same. It still voted independently at the Screen Writers' Guild. I still openly and avowedly didn't subscribe to the People's World. I still did no recruiting. I still stayed away from meetings whenever it suited me. There was no difference at all in my mind. Very vaguely I recall the evening the Duclos affair was discussed. It was an evening, I recall, when I was collecting dues in a side room. I also recall that about halfway through whatever discussion was taking place somebody, either Lawson or Cole, thought it advisable that I sit in on the meeting and listen to what was being discussed. Whether I ceased dues collecting for the moment or delayed it, I do not recall. But this I do know, so far as I was concerned this was another big hassle with Cole shouting at Lawson and Lawson trying to defend himself. Very frankly, by this time I had developed what is known as a radio ear. You just didn't listen. You sat there, but you just didn't listen. And what was more, didn't care. In all probability the next meeting was attended by my wife and I stayed home with the children. My wife tells me she used to get a lot of knitting done at those meetings. I know for a fact my children had a great many hand-knitted sweaters at the time. So some good, at least, came out of that. In all further probability I was given a copy of the Duclos letter to read at home. With great certainty, I know I threw it into the fireplace. Why I did this and why I did the same with most of the socalled literature handed out to me may be readily apparent. First, it was the dullest and most complex stuff you ever came across. Second, I wasn't going to waste any time on stuff I had long ago discounted. Third and most to the point-I knew that if one exposed himself too much to this kind of pretzel-bent reasoning, one could grow distorted. You might even get to believe it. And here may I throw in an interesting observation. I think there may have even been a calculated method to their madness of continual switches, reversals, and contradictions. A calculated policy to so con- COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 949 fuse the minds of their own members that they could no longer have any integrity. If a person allowed himself to be subjected to this sort of unprincipled thinking for 3 or 4 years he would no longer be capable of individual judgment and decision. He would become a complete intellectual and spiritual zombi.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever threatened with any disciplinary action by the Communist Party ?
Mr. ATLAS. I went to a meeting of the Screen Writers' Guild in which the major business was the matter of the proxy. Wr. WHEELER. What do you mean by "proxy"? 
Mr. ATLAS. The proxy to me had always meant the democratic right of every member in the organization to vote all issues they wished to, whether he were present at the meetings or not present at the meetings. This proxy is used, and I am grateful for it, in the Dramatists' Guild, and to the best of my knowledge had always been in force in the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you continue with your answer ?
Mr. ATLAS. I was aware that the purpose of the "dyed-in-the-wool" was to destroy the proxy for various reasons of their own. This was self-evident from the speeches made on the floor. I was violently opposed to the destruction of the proxy. I believe in the' democratic principles of the proxy, and I believe in it today. As a member of the dramatists' guild, I had on many occasions been grateful for the privilege of the proxy, which allowed me to vote on any issue, no matter where I was at the time. The proxy was a form of democratic principle. So long as a man was a member of an organization he had a right to think on issues and then cast his vote as he saw fit, whether he was present at the meeting or not. To this principle I strenuously and firmly hold. When the vote on the proxy issue came to a head, I openly raised my hand and voted in favor of the retention of the proxy, despite these speeches of the "dyed in the wool." I believe I was the only member of the association who did so. Several had seen me do this. When the meeting was adjourned, two approached me. One was Morton Grant and the other one a chap who I believe had recently come from the East, and whom I had never seen before, heard of before, or known before. It was pointed out to me that I had voted in contradiction to the way the "fraction" had decided. I told them I didn't give a darn which way the "fraction" had decided. I voted in what I believed was democratically just and right. I further avowed that I was unalterably opposed to the elimination of the proxy, that I believed in it and that I was not bound by anyone to vote against the dictates of my own conscience. The chap from the East grew angry and said something about disciplinary action. I grew angry, in turn, and pointed out that never under any circumstances would I subject my thoughts or actions to disciplinary action of the organization. My thoughts and my acts were my own, subject to no control of theirs. Morton, whom I rather liked, hushed up and smoothed over what rapidly was becoming a heated argument. However, the word "discipline" was an alarm bell to me. It awakened me to the fact that perhaps certain changes had taken place, of which I was unaware. 950 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. VWHEELER. Did there ever come an occasion when you came to the conclusion that the Communist Party or the Communist Political Association was again directly connected with the Comintern or the Russian Government?
Mr. ATLAS. It didn't quite come about that way. What occurred was after the disciplinary action was threatened, and which I utterly rejected, I became aware that probably something had changed in the organization since. I had acted independently at all times, but never before had I been threatened with this sort of thing. Shortly thereafter I sought out John Howard Lawson. I asked him a question, which I suppose was quite naive to him, but all important to me. I asked him directly whether our group was linked in any way to any international body or any foreign country. For reply, he merely smiled at me. I needed no further answer than that smile. From that point on my wife and I decided to get out. We were not going to subject any of our acts and thoughts to the discipline of any group, especially one that was even vaguely controlled by some foreign body. That was the line we had drawn from the very first. We knew that in all probability there would be retaliation of some sort. We knew beyond doubt there would be character assassination. We knew that we were risking our professional and economic life, and that of our children, who were merely babies at the time. We had no income whatsoever, other than that produced by my writing, which, as we knew at best, was always a precarious one. We were probably taking our livelihood in our hands, but despite all this, we felt we could no longer continue with an organization of this character, and out we got.
Mr. WHEELER. After you left the Communist Party, were you contacted by any individual to try to reactivate your membership?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes, my wife and I, when we failed to appear at meetings, they phoned us, sent emissaries to us. We told them flatly we weren't coming back. They wanted to know whether anything was disturbing us, that perhaps they could send one of their officials to talk to us. We replied that wasn't going to do any good, we just weren't coming any more. Finally they sent Mrs. John Weber to us. Now, this wasn't just an ordinary emissary, this was an emissary with hidden implications, as you may well see. We had never known or met Mrs. Weber before, or since. She evidently served a special purpose. Mrs. Weber was the wife of John Weber, one of the important writer's agents in Hollywood. A significant word or whisper from him, in the proper places, could mean the end of employment.
Mrs. Weber came to our home and asked us to come back, not once, but twice. On both occasions my wife and I were adamant. We told her the answer was not maybe or perhaps, but a flat no.
Mr. WHEELER. After leaving the Communist Party, did you have difficulty in getting writing assignments with the studios?
Mr. ATLAS. Yes, from that time on I didn't work with but one exception. Suddenly, from being an Academy nominee, a Pulitzer for creative writing, a writer whom Mr. Edward Small once flattered by saying I would go far in the industry, suddenly I received no more assignments with, as I said, one exception. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 951 There was a great deal of shadow boxing along the same line that Martin Berkeley described, though I haven't as concrete evidence as his. Mine was all in the realm of conjecture; could be or could not be. And one thing I wanted to guard myself against was developing a persecution phobia. Nor did I want to grow soured and embittered in myself. Of one occasion I must speak, however. I had still retained George Willner as my agent, as naively perhaps as Berkeley.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any further instances of attempted character assassination by the Communist Party?
Mr. ATLAS. Immediately subsequent to the congressional hearings in Washington, D. C., concerning the motion-picture industry, my wife and I bumped into Ben Barzman on the street. He was deeply exercised over what he called the "betrayal" by Dore Schary. What his reasons were I don't recall, but I do remember he was seriously considering drawing up a petition from all writers in town to demand Dore's resignation from MGM. This I thought was the rankest hypocrisy, and I flatly told him so. I stated that if any of the writers of MGM were dissatisfied with Dore's political views, they could take the initial step by first resigning themselves in protest. This I knew they would never do. I specifically had in mind several of the "dyed in the wool" who were at the very moment working at MGM. I told him this directly, knowing full well that it would get back to the "Cognoscenti" in one form or another. The crowning irony of the whole matter was that shortly thereafter, I believe it was, Mr. Barzman was working at MGM under Dore Schary, his very strenuous views evidently didn't prevent him from accepting paychecks from Dore, although he had been so ready to petition for the man's resignation a short time earlier.
Mr. WHEELER. D you have anything in addition that you would like to state for the record
Mr. ATLAS. There is one point I wish to make distinctly clear. I cannot emphasize it too strongly, because it is the truth. I do notdespite my having belonged to this discussion group-consider myself as having been even a fellow traveler. And here is a sharp distinction. At one point in time they traveled with my liberal point of view. Not I with their. They changed their credo, their standards, their basic tenets. I did not change mine. Nor have I done so to this day This is the literal and spiritual truth, as can be ascertained from the Encyclopaedia Britannica Yearbook article. The factual, ascertainable truth further is that I at all times acted and thought independently of them, even while being right in the midst of their circle. Further factual proof of this is that when I belatedly discovered that they had reverted to their original tenets, I left them as sharply as I could; even, mark you, to the extent that I knew I would be personally injured, economically and professionally; and that that injury would further affect my wife and my children. Nevertheless, I did what I had to, what I was compelled to do by my own conscience and belief. It didn't take a Korean war or any other world event to drive me from them. From the very first I wanted to break from them. When 952 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I discovered that they had gone back to their old stand I left them, sharply and distinctly, and have suffered sorely for having done so. If for a time I was bemused by their blandishments, may I state here that not only I, but many important men, men whose sources of income were vastly astronomically greater than mine, men too of great national responsibility, were also bemused. If we are guilty of anything, it is only of a fervent, idealistic and shining hope that out of the war-torn battered world might come a time of peace and amity everywhere. The slightest, the merest imputation that I might have been, if even for only a split second, disloyal to this great Nation of ours and its democratic principles, is sickening and abhorrent to me. As for my political affiliations, I am not ashamed of them. On the contrary, I am rather proud of them. I have been a registered Democrat all my life.
Mr. WHEELER. All right, Mr. Atlas. Thank you very much for your enlightening answers. (Whereupon the interrogation of Leopold Atlas was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-A3IERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT' An executive statement given at 4:10 o'clock, p. m., March 12, 1953, at room 1109, Statler Hotel, Los Angeles, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. TESTIMONY OF PAUL BENEDICT RADIN 2
Mr. WHEELER. Please state your full name.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Pauline Swanson Townsend.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you born ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Athens, Ohio.
Mr. WHEELER. Your educational background?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I was educated in the public schools in Athens, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio University in 1929.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been employed, or is your occupation that of a housewife?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I have been employed all my hfe, practically.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you state what your occupation is?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I am a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. You are the wife of Leo Townsend
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Townsend, have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state when you first became a member?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. In the spring of 1943.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the events that led up to your membership?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. We had been interested for many years in liberal causes, such as the migratory workers, relief for Spain. In the beginning of the United States' participation in the war we felt it very important to do something about the war. Friends whom we thought were liberals invited us to lecture groups, study groups. At one of these meetings we were invited to join the Communist Party, and did.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was actually responsible for you joining the party ? SReleased by the committee. Pauline Swanson Townsend was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 954 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Actually the responsibility is John Howard Lawson's. We went to a meeting at Waldo Salt's house, which had been represented to us as a discussion of current events. John Howard Lawson made a brilliant analysis of what was going on in the world, and in the meeting we were asked if we would like to join the Communist Party, and in a moment of excitement we did.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Townsend, during your membership in the party you were assigned to some of the same groups which your husband was a member of, is that correct ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, but not all.
Mr. WHEELER. It is those of which your husband was not a member that we are interested in. I would like to ask you what individuals you have met in the Communist Party, other than the ones you and your husband met together.
Mrs. TowNSEND. I will tell you the whole history of my membership in the Communist Party. After the meeting at the Salts we were told that we would hear from an official of the Communist Party. We were called by a girl who called herself Marjorie MacGregor. She said we should go to a meeting at such and such address in Beverly Hills. We went there. It was the home of Harold Buchman. There we met Mr. and Mrs. Buchman, of course, and the Maurice Rapfs, Robert Rossen and his wife Sue Rossen, Nicholas Bela, Fred Rmaldo. There must have been others, but at this point that is all I remember about that meeting. And at that meeting I felt unsatisfied and felt that I didn't understand what was going on and I made some comment to this effect, so I wasn't surprised when I was called and told I was reassigned to another group. I was put into a women's group, in which many of these same women were present. In addition to these women, Louis Solomon was billed as our educational director. He did not appear, but he was supposed to. Madelaine Ruthven was the executive secretary. Mrs. Goldie Bromberg was the chairman. This was a group of writers' wives, for the most part. Soon after this group was organized I had a call from Elizabeth Leech, who was the section organizer, accountable to the county organization of the party, who said that it had been decided I should take over the job of executive secretary of the Los Angeles Council of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship. I had been in the party very briefly and I knew very little about the Soviet Union. I knew even less about political organizations. I protested. My husband protested. I said no. Actually, my friends protested. Susan D'Usseau wrote from New York protesting. The reason for these protests was that I was working at the time in the 4th Fighter Command as a radar plotter. I loved it and I was useful and I felt fine about it. The party said, "This is more important." My friends felt that moving me was a mistake. Elizabeth Leech called back and said, "Jack feels you are the only person to do this job." And of course having met Jack in the original meeting and having felt from the beginning that this was the man who knew all the answers, I took the job over the protests of my husband and my friends. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 955 
Mr. THEELER. Who was the actual head of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship in Los Angeles?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. The Los Angeles Council was headed by a Dr. Thomas L. Harris, who was sent out here to organize this group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Dr. Harris as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did any functionaries of the Communist Party in Los Angeles, Calif., have any voice in the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Indeed they did.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you identify any of those? 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I was introduced to Dr. Thomas Harris by Helen Leonard, who was a Communist, and had been the executive secretary of al earlier group, the American Council on Soviet Relations. I met Dr. Harris at Helen Leonard's house, having been sent there by Elizabeth Leech. Elizabeth Leech was a functionary.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Carl Winter have any voice in the chapter here?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Very soon after I went to work for the council we established offices and brought in equipment. We had to draw up a program of influencing people in the direction of more friendship for the Soviet Union. Tom Harris and I met several times with Carl Winter in the restaurant at the Clark Hotel at Fourth and Hill Streets.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the nature of your discussions with Mr. Winter?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Vaguely, yes. We told Mr. Winter what we had managed to do so far in the way of organization, what people we had been able to enlist as board members and so forth, and we discussed program in the sense that whatever we did in the way of program would need the support and the assistance of the Communist Party "troops," we called them.
Mr. WHEELER. As a member of the Communist Party, do you think the party itself was instrumental in the organization and the success, of the local chapter ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. In restrospect, I think the Communist Party was completely responsible for the organization of the local council.
Mr. WHEELER. In restrospect, would you say the Communist Party was in control of the local chapter ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to any special or particular branch of the Communist Party while you were an employee of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. As a matter of fact, I was. I was assigned during my tenure on the board of the council to a special branch made up of people working in organizations devoted to the interest of American-Soviet friendship.
Mr. WHEELER. Was the emphasis placed on the Soviet friendship or the American friendship ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. The emphasis at this time was on winning the war. We were completely sold on the idea that American-Soviet friendship and American-Soviet collaboration were the most effective means of speeding up victory in the world conflict. I- 956 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the members of this group, Mrs. Townsend?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Arthur Birnkrant, Helen Leonard, Marie Rinaldo, Tania Tuttle, Ernest Dawson, Clara Walden, Mischa Walden's wife.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anybody else who was a member of this group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. There were other people who met with this group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there ever a fraction meeting that you attended that was called specifically to discuss the work of the local chapter of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did individuals who were members of the Communist Party but assigned to other branches of the party attend this fraction meeting?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who these individuals were? 1
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I recall some of them. Dorothy Atlas, Ruth Burrows, Patsy Moore, Mildred Benoff, Elena Beck, Edwina Pomerance.
Mr. WHEELER. You said Ruth Burrows?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. S
Mr. WHEELER. When did you cease to be active in the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. In November 1943, after the Shrine Auditorium meeting.
Mr. WHEELER. Did that have something to do with your ceasing to be active in the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. I, as a really naive operator in this kind of business, had involved all kinds of people in this particular celebration. This, as I recall, was a celebration of an anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The sponsors included the archbishop of the Catholic Church, Rabbi Magnin, Bishop Stevens, who made the invocation. Important American political and cultural figures appeared. From my standpoint it seemed a great success. I realized later, after having been called on the carpet by the county head of the Communist Party, that a communitywide acceptance of the program was not important, but that what was said, the content of what was said from the stage was what was important, and the content had not been satisfactory.
Mr. WHEELER. You were severely criticized for the program?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was the county functionary who criticized you?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Max Silver.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Silver remove you from your position or did you voluntarily make an exit?
Mrs. TowNsENI). Nobody removed me from my position. When I had begun this job, as I said, I had done it under protest. I worked very hard for 9 months, producing, with little understanding of what I was doing, several important events. I realized after this extremely well publicized and well attended meeting that I was working in the dark. I didn't know why or for what I was doing this. SMrs Leopold Atlas See p 935 for testimony of Leopold Atlas COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 957 I met with Tom Harris and said I would not work any longer as a full-time member of the council; that I would do what I could as a friend, but I would not work in the office. Very soon afterward my husband was called into the service and I went with him and dropped all contact with my organizational jobs.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you remain a member of the special party branch, concentrating on activities pertaining to the Soviet Union until you leftMrs. TOWNSEND. Until I left.
Mr. WHEELER. With your husband for New York. 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Until I left.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you leave for New York?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Exactly February 12, 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. While in New York City did you reaffiliate with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I meant to. I had a transfer slip which I was told to take to the New York Communist Party. I made one phone call.
Mr. WHEELER. From whom did you get the transfer slip here in Los Angeles?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Marjorie MacGregor.
Mr. WHEELER. In New York did you present it to any particular individual ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I did.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you recall to whom?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Peter Lyon. 
Mr. WHEELER. Peter Lyon is a radio writer; is that right?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I think so.
Mr. WHEELER. Through Peter Lyon were you assigned to any group or branch?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, I was. I was assigned to a writer's group, meeting at the 13th Street headquarters of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this group in New York City?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Exactly one meeting. 
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall anyone who was present in the meeting you attended?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. The only people I knew there were Howard Fast and-I didn't know them-I only knew them from reputation. There were Howard Fast and Richard O. Boyer.
Mr. WHEELER. When you received your transfer slip from Marjorie MacGregor in Los Angeles, were you instructed to contact Peter Lyon in New York City ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No, I was told somebody would contact me.
Mr. WHEELER. And Mr. Lyon contacted you?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you in New York?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Four and a half months.
Mr. WHEELER. At the end of the 41/ months you returned to Hollywood?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Upon your return to Hollywood did you renew your activities within the Communist Party? 958 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. We hadn't meant to, but we did.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you transfer from New York to Los Angeles?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO. I had no real affiliation with the New York group. I went to one meeting. I had planned actually to o to many more, but at this point my husband's plans were changed. He was not going overseas as he had thought. We had to make arrangements to go back to California. It seemed a very bad mistake to do anything further with the Communist Party, and I didn't go back to any meetings. I made no further contact with the Communist Party in New York.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you reaffiliate after your arrival back in Hollywood?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. We came back feeling that we should break with the Communist Party. However, after we arrived we found ourselves in the same social groups. I am not sure who asked us to a meeting, but we were asked to a meeting and we went to a meeting, and we reaffiliated with the Communist Political Association.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you and your husband assigned to the same group after you returned?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you continue in the same group?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you identify individuals whom you met as members of the Communist Party?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. In the first group?
Mr. WHEELER. In the first group.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Actually, I belonged to three groups after we came back. Leo belonged to two.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you identify the individuals that you met as Communists, in the first group?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Ben and Norma Barzman, Jay and Sondra Gorney, Pauline Lauber Finn, Ring Lardner, Alice Hunter, Bill Pomerance, Meta Reis, Richard Collins, Lewis Allen, Ben Bengal, John Weber.

Mr. WHEELER. What was Alice Hunter's occupation?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. She was the head of the Hollywood Democratic Committee or its successor the Hollywood Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the treasurer of this first group was?
Mrs. TowNSEND. Jay Gorney.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, you were subsequently transferred to a second group, is that correct? 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the second group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. It was a matter of months; I don't know how long. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 959 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any office in the second group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I did for a while. I was literature director.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members were of the second group?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Additional people, you mean ?
Mr. WHEELER. Additional people.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. John Wexley, Mrs. John Wexley.

Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Robert Shaw.
Mr. WHEELER. What is Robert Shaw's position ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I don't know what he is doing now. At that time he was writing on the Screen Writers' Guild magazine. Mary Shaw.
Mr. WHEELER. Is Mary Shaw the wife of Robert Shaw ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. I don't think I remember any more.
Mr. WHEELER. Then you were subsequently transferred to a third group, is that correct?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the third group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Two weeks.
Mr. WHEELER. Two weeks? 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any position in the third group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO. I was offered a position and I turned it down.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members were of the third group
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Andreas Dinam, Catherine Becker, Julian Zimet, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Richards.
Mr. WHEELER. Which Mrs. Richards was that ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Ann Roth Morgan Richards.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Pamela Richards?

Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, I recruited them.
Mr. WHEELER. You recruited them into the party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were they assigned to any group or unit you were a member of ? 960 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have occasion to process their membership application?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No. Their cards were brought into our branch. This is Communist Party technique. The cards were brought into our branch; we recruited them. They were voted on there. No one had any objection and they were sent on to the section, and from that point I have no idea what happened.
Mr. WHEELER. But your group voted on their membership ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Not really voted. The cards are presented. If there is no objection the cards are turned over to the organizational secretary, who takes them to the section organizational meeting. I have no idea to what branch they were assigned.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know of any similar cases to that of the Wooleys?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you testify to that?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. The same evening that the Wooleys' cards were-as a matter of fact, she was not Mrs. Wooley at that time, but Barbara Roberts-and at that same time a card was presented for Reuben Ship.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who presented Reuben Ship's card to your meeting ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Cyril Endfield.
Mr. WHEELER. That would indicate that Mr. Endfield recruited Reuben Ship ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. He had brought in his application card, yes. Since you brought up the name of Reuben Ship, I now remember that Cyril Endfield was a member of this particular branch.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you have any information of Communist Party membership regarding Henrietta Martin?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. The last branch to which I was assigned, meetings of which I attended twice, Henrietta Martin was supposedly a member. She was not present when I was there, but her absence was discussed.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Patsy Moore or Patricia Moore as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I never attended a Communist Party branch meeting with Patricia Moore.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend a fraction meeting with Patricia Moore?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Shortly after I joined the Communist Party I was invited to meet with Communist members of the Committee for the Care of Children in Wartime. We met at Mrs. Moore's house.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else attended this meeting that you recall?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. There must have been 8 or 9 women there. I remember Mrs. Moore, Elizabeth Faragoh, and Louise Moss, who is now Louise Losey, and several women representing union organizations whose names I do not recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you attend any special classes set up by the Communist Party for indoctrination?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, one. Soon after we joined the Communist Party we were assigned to a class in Marxist theory, led by Dr. Leo Bigelman. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 961 
Mr. WHEELER. Where was this class held, do you recall?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. At Dr. Bigelman's house in the valley.
Mr. WHEELER. How many people attended this class?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. From 6 to 12.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did the class last ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Eight weeks, I think.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who else attended this particular class ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. In part, I remember Frank Tarloff, Marguerite Roberts.
Mr. WHEELER. Marguerite Roberts is Mrs. John Sanford
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Was John Sanford also present?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Ye.. Everett Well. There were others also. Those are all I remember.
Mr. WIEELER. Now, do you recall any other individual you met as a member of the Communist Party who has not been identified publicly before the House Committee on Un-American Activities?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you meet Max Benoff, a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I have met Max Benoff.
Mr. WHEELER. Under what circumstances did you meet Max Benoff ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I first met Max Benoff when he was sent to Hollywood as a writer on a radio show on which my husband was working. I met him later socially with his wife Mickey. I went once with my husband to their house, to what might have been a meeting of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you and your husband friends of M.r. and Mrs. Benoff?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Not really, no.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever go to their home socially ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Not that I recall.
Mr. WHEELER. 'Had they ever been at your home just socially ?
Mrs. TOWNEND. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know any reason why you would ever meet them socially?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Outside of the political atmosphere; no.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the purpose of your visit to the Benoff's home?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I really don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember if it was for dinner?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO; it was not. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if there were other people there, other than you and your husband?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. There were other people ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who they were ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. You previously stated in your testimony that Mickey Benoff was assigned to work with you in the council.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. And that you met her as a member of the Communist Party in a fraction meeting. 31747-53-pt. 5--9 962 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA SMrs. TOWNSEND. I assumed she was a member of the Communist S Party, since she was assigned to work for the council and sent from a certain branch in the valley.
Mr. WHEELER. You knew Mrs. Benoff as i member of the Communist Party? S Mli. TOWDNSEND. I assumed she was a member of the Communist Party. She was assigned to work for me.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mr. Benoff active in the National Council of S American-Soviet Friendship, to your knowledge
Mr. TOWNSEND. No.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you say you severed your relationship with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWxSEND. The summer of 1948.
Mr. WIIEELER. Why did you leave the Communist Party?
Mrs. TowNSEND. I never belonged in the Communist Party. At the very first meeting I attended I was called a disruptive influence. I asked questions and got unsatisfactory answers. Instead of answers I got a transfer to another branch and yet another branch and yet another branch. I worked in the higher levels of the Communist Party activities during my work with the council still asking questions, still getting no answers, and fled. lMr. IIEELER. Do you think the Communist Party works in the best interest of the American Government?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No I recall one specific instance. I think that the American Communist Party, whether members are aware of this or not, moves only in the interests of the Soviet Union. I recall at one point in 1947 when I felt uncomfortable in the Communist Party, but didn't know quite the way out. I was instrumental in starting through the branches a protest report in which Bob Shaw and I collaborated, which said, in effect, that the American Communist Party had no contact with the American people. It talked gibberish gobbledygook to the American people; that it was useless in this country in relation to liberal issues and progressive issue; that indeed it was destroying Henry A Wallace at the moment, because as we said then when Stalin snuffs pepper the American Communist Party sneezes. We felt then, naively, that the American Communist Party could exist separately from Soviet domination and we strongly urged a try. This report was presented at our branch to the great consternation of some people. A section convention was coming up and it was proposed the report go to the convention, as supported by our branch. The vote was, as I recall, 8 to 5 in favor of taking it to the convention. The opposition said, "Let's hear it once more. We will call everybody and see that everybody comes next week." So the next week 23 people came to hear this report. Also in attendance was Mr. Sidney Benson from the county educational department. The report was read and voted on, and approved for presentation to the county convention by a vote, I think, of 14 to 9, after which Mr. Benson was introduced, and protested. He felt the report was naive and misunderstood the conflicts of the day. Nevertheless, the people who had voted the report in insisted it go on to the convention. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 963 The next order of business was that they elected me as a delegate to the convention to take the report. The report went to a resolutions committee headed by John Howard Lawson, and at the convention where I went as a delegate I waited for its presentation, since it had gone through three readings in our branch and been approved by a large majority at each. At about noon, and in the program of the convention the resolutions had their time, and Mr. Lawson read excerpts from many resolutions, from the 20 or so branches m the sections, and took great pains to denounce as infantile and leftist and Trotskyist the reolution from our particular branch. There was no chance for the delegates to hear or disapprove the material. It was not read.
Mr. WHEELER. Did this cause your final break from the Communist Party?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes; it really did. I stayed throughout the day. I protested in my own way during the afternoon. When the convention voted as a body to send Nenuny Sparks to the State convention, there were all ayes but mine, and I was a no, the one no.
Mr WIHEELER. 1Mr. Lawson was against moving the Communist Party in the United States from under the control of the Russsian Government?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I can only assume that. I know after this convention I was visited in sequence by Harry Carlyle, who was educational director for the section, and by John Stapp, who was the section organizer. With John Stapp I had a very long talk about this resolution, which was a 40-page document full of everything I believed, and my collaborator believed at the time. After questioning certain points in the resolution for an hour or 2 hours, Mr. Stapp said, "Of course, if you are anti-Soviet, there is no hope." Suddenly I realized I was.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Robert Shaw's attitude toward the way the resolution was handled at the convention?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Robert Shaw was not at the convention, but he wrote the resolution. Actually, I would say he wrote the major part of it. We discussed it in collaboration. He wrote the first draft. I wrote the second draft.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you discuss the procedure followed?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. He was present with Harry Carlyle. He was present with John Stapp.
Mr. WHEELER. What was his attitude with regard to the resolution?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. His attitude was completely sympathetic to me.
Mr. WHEELER. IS there anything else you would like to add for the record?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I can't think of anything.
Mr. WHEELER. Thank you, Mrs. Townsend.

Mr. RADIN. I am at present an agent employed in the radio and television field.
Mr. WHEELER. How long have you been in this particular occupation?
Mr. RADIN. I have been an agent, for approximately 3 years.
Mr. WHEELER. Prior to that what was your business?
Mr. RADIN. Prior to that I was in the advertising business.
Mr. WHEELER. And for how long ?
Mr. RADIN. Ever since I was graduated from college, with time out during the war.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your major in college?
Mr. RADIN. Advertising.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you any relation at all to Dr. Max Radin ?
Mr. RADIN. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. We have in our files information concerning one Paul Radin, which I don't believe is you. However, I would like to clear this up.
Mr. RADIN. I will be glad to clear up anything I can. There is a Paul Radin that I know of who is a brother of Max Radin, who is, I believe, a professor of anthropology, or some such subject. a Released by the committee 'Paul Benedict Radin was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 966 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. That is right. We have here one Paul Radin who was instructor at the California Labor School in 1948.
Mr. RADIN. This is not I.
Mr. WHEELER. We have one Paul Radin who was a member of the League of American Writers in 1938, according to the summer bulletin of that organization.
Mr. RADIN. This is not I.
Mr. WHEELER. We have one Paul Radin who, according to Soviet Russia Today, which is a magazine, dated September 1939, was a signer of a letter advocating closer cooperation with the Soviet Union.
Mr. RADIN. To the best of my knowledge this is not I.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you ever recall signing such a letter?
Mr. RADIN. No; I don't recall signing any such thing.
Mr. WHEELER. According to the New Masses, a Communist publication of April 27, 1937, a Paul Radin contributed an article to Science and Society.
Mr. RADIX. This is not I.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever live in Washington, D. C.?
Mr. RADIN. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. We have a Paul Radin who was a member of the Washington Book Shop.
Mr. RADIN. I never heard of the Washington Book Shop.
Mr. WHEELER. You were never a member ?
Mr. RADIN. No; I was never a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever review any books for the Western Worker?
Mr. RADIN. I have never reviewed any books.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Radin, the committee has in its possession testimony from a former member of the Communist Party who testified under oath that you were in attendance at meetings of the Communist Party here in Hollywood. Is that a true statement?
Mr. R4DIN. I attended meetings which I believe were Communist Party meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. RADIN. I was not.
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings would you say you attended?
Mr. RADIN. Since we last spoke I have tried to pinpoint this. To the best of my knowledge, I attended 3 meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. When would you date these meetings?
Mr. RADIN. I would date them in 1946 or 1947. I measure this by the time I met my now present wife. I have been married 4 years, almost 5.
Mr. WHEELER. What arrangements were made for you to attend the meetings and by whom?
Mr. RADIx. I was brought to the meetings by Joe Losey, who was a friend of mine, social friend.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you first meet Joe Losey ?
Mr. RADIN. I think I met him at a party. I am not sure at whose house it was. I was a newcomer to Hollywood at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mrs. Losey also in attendance ?
Mr. RADIN. Where? 
Mr. WHEELER. At the meetings you attended.
Mr. RADIN. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 967 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where the meetings were held?
Mr. RADIN. One meeting was held at the home of John Wexley. Another meeting was held at the home of Leo Townsend. The third meeting was held at the home, I believe, of Jay Gorney.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the individuals were that were in attendance at these meetings?
Mr. RADIN. To the best of my recollection, the following were at the meetings-I don't know whether all of these people attended all the meetings-Mr. and Mrs. Losey, Meta Reis, Lester Cole, Jay Gorney, John Wexley, Dick Collins, Mrs. Gorney, Waldo Salt, Mr. and Mrs. Townsend, John Weber.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if dues were collected at these meetings?
Mr. RADIN. I believe dues were collected at the meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay any dues?
Mr. RADIN. I never paid dues.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the individual who collected the dues?
Mr. RADIN. No; I do not.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was chairman of these particular meetings or who was running the meetings?
Mr. RADIN. No; I don't recall. I have a feeling that the leaders of the group-and I don't remember whether they conducted the meetings or not-were Dick Collins and Waldo Salt.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you asked to join the Communist Party?
Mr. RADIN. Yes; I was.
Mr. WHEELER. By whom? 
Mr. RADIN. By Joe Losey.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you date the approximate time? Was it the first meeting, the second meeting, the third meeting or prior to the time you attended the meetings or subsequently ?
Mr. RADIN. I would say that the 3 meetings that I attended were over a period of about 6 weeks. To the best of my recollection, I was asked to join the Communist Party during that time. I don't remember when.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, if it would be prior to the time you attended these meetings, you would have full knowledge of the Communist Party.
Mr. RADIN. No; it was not prior to the attending of the meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. You say it was subsequent to the attending of the meetings?
Mr. RADIN. It was during that 6-weeks' period, I believe. It was either after the first meeting or the second meeting.
Mr. THEELER. Then you, at least, attended 1 or 2 meetings with full knowledge that they were Communist Party meetings?
Mr. RADIN. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your immediate reaction to being asked to join the Communist Party ?
Mr. RADIN. It left me cold. I had no interest in it.
Mr. WHEELER. What would be your reasoning then for attending the meeting subsequent to the time you were asked ?
Mr. RADIX. Joe was a friend of mine-I just was not too sure of myself. I didn't want to encourage Joe's displeasure. It wasn't until the third meeting that I knew that I never wanted to have anything to do with it. 968 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. How did you reach this decision ?
Mr. RADIN. Sitting at this group or with this group, I was impressed by the lack of independent thinking, by the almost automaton procedure that went on. Also that these people weren't at all interested in the same things I was interested in. I have always considered myself more or less of a liberal, and this was not my idea of what hberalism was. This was a rigid unequivocal dictatorship of thought. I don't know how else to put it.
Mr. WHEELER. You realized that every person present at this meeting, with the exception of yourself, was a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. RADIN. No, I don't know; to my knowledge, I don't know they were all members of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, they have all been identified as such before this House committee.
Mr. RADIN. If you say so. I do not know at firsthand knowledge whether anybody was there in the same position I was.
Mr. WHEELER. I would like to make the observation it is highly unusual for a person who is not a member to attend closed meetings of the Communist Party.
Mr. RADIN. I don't know anything of the procedure.
Mr. WHEELER. But you did not sign a Communist Party card
Mr. RADIN. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. You did not receive a Communist Party card?
Mr. RADIN. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. You did not pay dues?
Mr. RADIN. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. What is your present attitude regarding the Communist Party?
Mr. RADIN. I have absolutely no sympathy with them.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you made any information you may have regarding the Communist Party available to any other agency
Mr. RADIN. Yes, I made whatever information I had available to the FBI.
Mr. WHEELER. Are these the only three meetings you ever attended?
Mr. RADIN. To the best of my knowledge, yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you like to add anything to the record?
Mr. RADIN. I just want to add that I come here in the spirit of complete cooperation and will do everything I can to help.
Mr. WHEELER. But you have not been subpenaed?
Mr. RADIN. I have not been subpenaed.
Mr. WHEELER. This is voluntary?
Mr. RADIN. This is voluntary. Ur WHEELER. Thank you, Mr. Radin. (Whereupon the interrogation of Paul Benedict Radin was concluded.) INDEX INDIVIDUALS Page 890 .. -----------Abowitz, Mrs. Murray ---- _-------.-_.. 924 Alexander, Michael_ -----_____ 941, 958 Allen, Lewis __------853 Amster, Lou ---------898 -- --Arden, Betty ------892 ------___ _______--_ _ Arnold, Lucy -----869 -----------Ashe, Harold --------------- --------------- 869 -------------Ashe, Mildred.. 945 --------Atkinson, Brooks____----------------_ -------956 Atlas, Dorothy (Mrs Leopold Atlas) -Atlas, Leopold Lawrence ----------9-30, 935-952 (testimony) 935 Baker, Professor-------Baron, Lou ----890, 893 -----------___ 894 ----Boroway, Leo--__ Barzian, Ben --------------938, 940, 951, 958 Barzman, Norma-..---------958 .....--------------Barzman, Sol --------959 Bay, Howard --959 Bay, Ruth-- __---------------------- 959 9i9 Beck, Elena -------------- - 902-904, 906, 956 Beck, George 930 Becker, Catherine --------959 Becker, Zara -------------------------871 Bela, Nicholas --------------------927, 954 -----Bela, Mrs. Nicholas -- 928 Bengal, Ben----------___----------944,958 Bennett ---------877 Bennett, Alice ----------------------855 Benoff, Max------------803, 902-905, 961 Benoff, Mickey--------------_--------------961 Benoff.
