Mr. TAVENNER. You are Michael Gordon?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. WOOD. Before beginning, Mr. Gordon, under the rules of this committee you have a perfect right to consult your counsel at any time you see fit to do so, and obtain from him any advice or information that you desire concerning your rights as a witness here before this committee.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you.
Mr. WOOD. And that goes for any other witness that appears before this committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mr. Michael Gordon ? COMMUNISM 
Mr. GORDON. IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1483 Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Where and when were you born, Mr. Gordon?
Mr. GORDON. Baltimore, Md., September 6, 1909.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you live?
Mr. GORDON. At the moment at the Portal Motel on Cahuenga Boulevard.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is you occupation ?
Mr. GORDON. I am a screen director, and I formerly was a stage director.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state briefly for the committee what your educational background has been.
Mr. GORDON. The public elementary and high schools of Baltimore, Md., the Johns Hopkins University, Yale University.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you speak just a little bit louder, please. I understood you but with some difficulty. What has been your employment record, in brief ?
Mr. GORDON. I arrived in New York in 1932. From 1932 to 1940 I was variously employed as an actor, assistant stage manager, stage manager, assistant director, and director. In 1940 I came to Hollywood, where I worked as a dialog director, then later as a director. In an interim period, from 1943 to 1946, in theater again, and from 1946 until April of this year I was here as a director.
Mr. TAVENNER. What are some of the principal pictures which you have directed?
Mr. WooD. The witness objects to being photographedMr. GORDON. I don't object, Mr. Chairman, but I think it is very distracting if they stand there for quite some time.
Mr. WooD. Just a little bit closer to the microphone and elevate your voice a little bit more. I will have to ask the photographers to refrain from distracting the witness.
Mr. WmIIN. He has no objection. He wants them to get through, but he wants to go on and testify.
Mr. GORDON. Would you repeat the question, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. The question was, What are the principal pictures that you have directed ?
Mr. GORDON. In chronological order, they were: Boston Blackie Goes Hollywood. Underground Agent, One Dangerous Night, The Crime Doctor, The Webb, Another Part of the Forest, An Act of Murder, The Lady Gambles, Woman in Hiding, Cyrano de Bergerac, I Can Get It for You Wholesale, and The Secret of Convict Lake.
Mr. Woon. I am afraid we are having a little difficulty hearing you. Can you speak just a little louder?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Gordon, are you acquainted with Mr. Frank Tuttle ?
Mr. GORDON. Mr. Frank Tuttle
Mr. TAVENNER. That is the Mr. Frank Tuttle who is the director, a moving-picture director. I believe there are several persons by that name.
Mr. GORDON. I believe the man you referred to appeared before this committee, and in the context of his appearance I will claim the privilege of fifth amendment and decline to answer questions of my alleged acquaintance with Mr. Tuttle on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate me. 14S4 COMMXINISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVIx.NER. Mr. Tuttle, as you have stated, has appeared before this committee. The date of his appearance was May 24, 1951, at which time he was asked a question to name the directors who were associated with him in the Communist Party. Among the questions, this was asked him: If you will, name for the committee who they were. That is, who were the directors associated with him in the Communist Party. To which he replied:1 , Yes.,I have already named Mr. Biberman, who was a director, Mr. Dmytryk, myself, Mr. Michael Gordon, Mr. Jules Dassin. These two gentlemen, I think, left the party. I'm not sure when. Mr. Bernard Vorhaus. Is it a correct statement that you were a member of the Communist Party while a director in Hollywood?
Mr. GORDOx. I decline to answer that question on the grounds stated in relation to the previous question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of an article appearing on page 5 of the People's World of February 11, 1943. It is to the effect that one Michael Gordon and others are teacher-directors at the League of American Writers School. Would you look at it and identify the article.
Mr. GoRDON. I have seen the article, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you engage, as that article says, as a teacherdirector at the League of American Writers School?
Mr. GORDON. I believe that the League of American Writers School and the League of American Writers are both listed as subversive organizations by your committeeMr. WOOD. Irrespective of what the listing is, you were asked a direct question, and would you answer it. Were you a teacher in that school?
Mr. GoRDoN. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds I explained.
Mr. WooD. There is no necessity to explain what the citation has been about the school. If you refuse to answer the question you can state your reasons for not answering it.
Mr. WmIR. He was also stating his reasons, sir, as I understood it.
Mr. WooD. The reason doesn't involve what happened to the school. If it involves him he could so answer. If the answer would tend to incriminate him he has a right to claim that privilege.
Mr. WIRIN. My understanding is that he was merely explaining why he declined to answer.
Mr. WooD. I was explaining to the witness. Do you decline to answer the question ?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer the question on the grounds of the fifth amendment, on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I show you a copy of an advertisement that appeared in the Sunday Worker of September 22, 1940, at page 7. According to this advertisement Michael Gordon was one of the directors SSee Communist Infiltration of Hollywood Motion-Picture Industry-Part 3, p. 629.  1485 of the New Theater School. Is that a correct recital of fact, namely that you were a director of the New Theater School?
Mr. GORDON. I will decline to answer that question, too, on the previously stated grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I show you a photostatic copy of what is entitled "The Original Statement of the Committee for the First Amendment," and its original signers. Will you examine it, please. (The document was handed to the witness.) Among the original signers appears the name of Michael Gordon. Are you the Michael Gordon referred to in that statement?
Mr. GORDON. May I consult with counsel, please, Mr. Chairman? 
Mr. WooD. Yes, sir. You have that right at any time you desire, sir.
Mr. GORDON (after consulting with counsel). I decline to answer that question, too, sir, on the previously stated grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. In this statement the signers say they are disgusted and outraged by the continued attempt of the House Committee on Un-American Activities to smear the motion-picture industry. Do you join in that expression of opinion that the House committee has smeared the motion-picture industry ?
Mr. GoRDON. Are you asking my personal opinion on this subject?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. GORDON. I would prefer not to express or discuss my personal opinions under the circumstances of my appearance here today.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sign a statement in which you stated that that was your opinion?
Mr. GoRDow. You have asked this question in another form, sir, a moment ago. I have declined to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Committee for the First Amendment?
Mr. GORDON. This is the third time you have asked the same ques- tion, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. No; I have not asked that question. 
Mr. WooD. Let's don't argue. We will get along a lot faster.
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer that question on the grounds pre- viously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been affiliated with the Actors' Laboratory?
Mr. GORDON. I claim the privilege of the fifth amendment on that question as well, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a letterhead of the Actor's Laboratory Theater-I will withdraw that question. Were you at any time a metnber of the executive board of the Actors' Laboratory Theater?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer that question on the grounds that to do so might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no other questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Gordon, what criminal charge do you think might he preferred against you if you were to admit that you knew Frank Tuttle ?
Mr. GORDON. Representative Walter, I am in no sense of the word equipped to discuss from a legal point of view the nature of the fifth amendment. I believe I understand its intent, and I feel that to 1486 answer that question, to attempt to explain why I feel an answer to a prior question might tend to incriminate me, might in itself incriminate me. Therefore I must decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. WALTER. You surely must have had a reason for declining to answer.
Mr. GORDON. Have you asked a question, sir
Mr. WALTER. Yes. You had a reason, didn't you, for declining to answer the question ?
Mr. GORDON. I have declined to answer the question in the first instance, and it seems to me that rephrasing this is simply an attempt to shake my position, which I do not wish to have shaken. I will stand on the privilege, sir.
Mr. WALTER. I am not attempting to do anything of the sort. I am just wondering whether or not you aren't arbitrarily hiding behind the section of the Constitution of the United States that does not appear in the constitution of Russia or any of the iron-curtain countries. I would like to know why you decline to answer.
Mr. GORDON. I would like to take issue with your statement that I am hiding something, sir. That implies a criticism and attack not only on the fifth amendment of the Constitution, it seems to me, but on the citizen who invokes'it. I believe that this provision was placed in the Constitution not simply as campaign oratory but to be used and to be used in just such a situation as this.
Mr. WALTER. To be used, yes; that's correct.
Mr. WIRIN. May I address the chairman of the committee in this connection, in connection with this matter?
Mr. WALTER. I haven't yielded. I am in the middle of interrogating the witness, you see.
Mr. WmIN. Would you yield so that I may ask the chairman a ques- tion, sir?
Mr. WOOD. Counsel's prerogative in this committee is to advise his client.
Mr. Wnaw. I understand. But you have ruled that he doesn't have to explain about the fifth amendment.
Mr. WOOD. And I don't want to have any argument about my ruling.
Mr. WALTER. He has been advised, of course. It is quite obvious.
Mr. WIRIN. I have done the best that I could; yes.
Mr. WALTER. You have done well. I would like to know what is in your mind. You have declined to answer the question as to whether or not you knew somebody on the ground that to admit that you knew this man might subject you to a prosecution.
Mr. WIRIN. Would you yield to me, Mr. Congressman, for a moment?
Mr. WOOD. I will have to ask you to retire from the hearing room unless you remain quiet. You can advise your client any time you desire, and that's as far as your rights go here.
Mr. WIIN. May I do so now (The witness consulted with his counsel.)
Mr. GORDON. I am sorry, Mr. Walter. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1487 
Mr. WALTER. What I want to know is what prosecution do you think could be lodged against you for admitting that you knew an individual who happens to be employed in Hollywood.
Mr. GORDON. Mr. Walter, I believe I stated, to the best of my ability, that to attempt to explain why I feel an answer to a question may tend to incriminate me that the explanation itself might equally tend to incriminate. Consequently I have refused to answer that question, basing my refusal on the fifth amendment.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr. WALTER. That's all, Mr. Chairman. WooD. Mr. Doyle? DOYLE. No questions. WooD. Mr. Jackson. JACKSON. Mr. Gordon, are you devoted to the Constitution of the United States?
Mr. GORDON. I believe I am.
Mr. JACKSON. Would you support and defend the United States of America in case of conflict with the Soviet Union ? 
Mr. GORDON. Would you particularize that question a little more fully? How do you mean "support and defend"?
Mr. JACKSON. Not at all. Would you fight for this country?
Mr. GORDON. In event of war with the Soviet Union ?
Mr. JACKSON. Yes. 
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. Do you approve the course of action taken by this country in Korea ?
Mr. GORDON. You are asking again my personal opinion. I have said earlier that I do not consider this an adequate forum for myselfMr. JACKSON. Every American citizen, Mr. Gordon, has an opinion with respect to the actions of this country in Korea. It is not invading the realm of opinion. Either you approve of it or you don't approve of it. I think it is a very simple question and could be answered very simply by "Yes" or "No."
Mr. GORDON. I prefer not to discuss my personal opinions under the circumstances of my appearance before this committee, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter ?
Mr. POTrER. No questions. 
Mr. WooD. Any further questions by counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No reason.
Mr. Charles Daggett.
Mr. WooD. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn, please. You do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give this subcom- mittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. DAGGETT. So help me God.
Mr. WooD. Proceed. by counsel? Will you be seated? Are you represented 1488 
Mr. DAGGETT. Yes; I am.
Mr. WOOD. Will counsel give his name and address.
