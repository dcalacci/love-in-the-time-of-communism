Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee what you know, if anything, regarding the participation in that organization of members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SoLyroY. I am not able to help the committee in that regard at all, sir. During the time that I was on the board of directors of that organization, I was not aware of any Communist Party members in it.
Mr. WOOD. Would you inquire what year that was ?
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date, the period of time when you were on that organization ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. My best recollection is that it was toward the end of 1947 and perhaps early 1948-1947 and 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was John Howard Lawson a member of the board of directors with you in that organization ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I frankly don't know, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were acquainted with Mr. John Howard Lawson, weren't you ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. No; I was not.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy, page 3 of the Daily People's World of January 26, 1948, and I will ask you to look at the last paragraph of an article appearing there under the caption "It is our No. 1 job" where you will find listed the names of the board members, and I will ask you to examine it and state whether or not it refreshes your recollection that Mr. John Howard Lawson was a member of the board of directors with you.
Mr. SOLOTOY. It does not refresh my memory.
Mr. TAVENNER. It does not. Were you acquainted with Mr. Sam Moore ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. The name does not mean anything to me, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you look again at the list of members of the board of directors and state whether or not you find listed there the name of Sam Moore.
Mr. SOLOTOY. I see it listed, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Does that note refresh your recollection that he served on the board with you
Mr. SOLOTOY. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you'actually participate in the board meetings ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I participated in one full board meeting that I remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you do not remember the presence of Mr. Law- son or Mr. Moore?
Mr. SOLOTOY. No, sir.  
Mr. TAVENNER. I think that is all. 1495 Were you acquainted with Mr. Herbert Klein ?
Mr. HoRowrrz. I'm sorry; I didn't hear you.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Herbert Klein, K-l-e-i-n, sometimes referred to as Herb.
Mr. SowroT. I must decline to answer that, sir, on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. WOOD. You are under no compulsion
Mr. SoLTOY. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I do decline.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter?
Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. NO questions.
Mr. JACKSON. I think you said that during the time you were on the board of directors of the Southern California Progressive Citizens of America that you were not aware of any Communists on that board.
Mr. SOLOTOY. That's correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know any members of the Communist Party
Mr. SOLOTOY. I must decline to answer-I'm sorry. I do decline to answer that, Congressman, on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no further questions. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter?
Mr. POTTER. No questions. 
Mr. WOOD. I believe you say you served on the board of directors of the Southern California Progressive Citizens of America during the years or a portion of the years 1947 and 1948.
Mr. SOLOTOY. For several months, I said, sir; toward the end of the year 1947 and the early part of 1948.
Mr. WooD. And during that period you had no knowledge of the presence on that board of any Communists?
Mr. SOLOTOY. That's correct.
Mr. WOOD. Well, I will ask you whether or not you were a member of the Communist Party in 1947.
Mr. SOLOTOY. I decline to answer that.
Mr. WOOD. Or in 1948 ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I decline to answer that, also.
Mr. WOOD. You have said that you have no knowledge of the presence on that board of any Communist during that period of time and that you were a member of it yourself. Now, why is it that you decline to tell us whether you were a member or not, because if you were you must have known one member of the board that was a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I am sorry, sir; I decline to answer that question. 
Mr. WOOD. You decline to answer that one, too
Mr. SLOTOY. Yes.
Mr. WOOD. For the ground that you previously have given?
Mr. SOLOTOY. That's correct, sir.
Mr. WooD. So you are leaving this committee now that, notwithstanding the fact that you have testified that there was not a member of the Communist Party on that board during that time, to your knowledge, but that you decline to answer whether you were or not at that time yourself; is that the way you want to leave it? 1496 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr'. SOLOTOY. I will revise my answer to that, Congressman. I was not a member of the Communist Party during the period I was on the board of directors of the Progressive Citizens of America.
Mr. WOOD. Well, were you conscious of that fact when you declined to answer that question a moment ago, or did you answer it inadvertently ?
Mr. SOLOTOr. I answered inadvertently. 
Mr. WOOD. Well, have you been a member of the Communist Party since 1948? iMr. SOLOTOY. No. 
Mr. WOOD. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1946 ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I shall decline to answer that question upon the grounds of self-incrimination.
Mr. WOOD. In 1945 ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I shall decline upon the same grounds, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions, Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. JACKsoN. One further question. Mr. Solotoy, have you trav- eled abroad within the past 10 years?
Mr. SOLOTOY.
Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. SOLOTOY.
Mr. JACKSON. No, sir. You have not been out of the country ? Not that I can remember. Have you been out of .the country since your original entry in, I believe, 1924 ?
Mr. SOLOTOY. I believe that I may have made a trip to Ensenada or Tijuana.
Mr. JACKSON. You have never made application for a passport?
Mr. SOLTroY. No, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. No further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Any reason why this witness shouldn't be excused?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO, sir.
Mr. WoOD. So ordered. Do you desire to take another witness this afternoon? It is ap- proaching 5: 30.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; I think it would hardly pay to start with another witness at this time.
Mr. WOOD. 9:30 in the morning, gentlemen ? The committee will stand in recess until 9: 30 tomorrow morning. (Whereupon, at the hour of 5:20 p. m., an adjournment was taken until 9:30 a. m. of the following day.) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 4 TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1951 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIvrIIES, Los Angeles, Calif.
