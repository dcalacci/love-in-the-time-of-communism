Mrs. ASHE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were formerly the wife of Mr. Harold Ashe?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes.  1463 
Mr. TAVENNER. When were you and Mr. Ashe married ?
Mrs. ASHE. In September, 1927.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now divorced ? 
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, we are.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you obtain your divorce ?
Mrs. ASHE. In November of 1936. (At-this point Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. During the period of your marriage were you at any time a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the time and circumstances under which you became a member of the Communist Party? 
Mrs. AsHE. Well, I, too, was a member of the Socialist Party and Oleta O'ConnorMr. TAVENNER. Will you please raise your voice a little bit. 
Mrs. ASHE. Suppose I move in a little bit.
Mr. TAVENNER. I wish you would spell the proper names, please.
Mrs. ASHE. Okay. Oleta O'Connor came down to Commonwealth House on a speaking tour as a member of the Socialist Party and we had a lot of what Mr. Ashe calls rump sessions. During that period we decided, all of us, that we would go into the Communist Party.
Mr. Ashe joined about 3 months before I did. I think I joined about the end, that is the last of December of 1933.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, is Oleta O'Connor the same person as Oleta O'Connor Yates ?
Mrs. AsHE. Yes. unmarried name. At that time she was not married. That's her 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was your husband a member of the Communist Party at the time that you joined ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; he was.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long had he been a member, to your knowledge?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I didn't know that he was a member. He was a member a few months before I knew it. I would say probably 2 or 3 months. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you become acquainted with a person by the name of Millicent Hayes ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. I was Millicent Hayes. That was my party name. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Why were you given the name of Millicent Hayes ? 
Mrs. ASHE. Well, because during that period it was customary for new recruits to use a name other than his own name. It was customary in the party. Very rarely did anyone join under their own name.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO what unit or cell of the party were you assigned ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I wasn't assigned to anything for several months because of Mr. Ashe's connection with the Socialist Party as State secretary and so forth. We were all more or less, shall I say, kept underground.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you, during that period, attend Communist Party meetings? 
Mrs. ASHE. Not open meetings; no.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend closed meetings? 1464 
Mrs. AsHE. Yes. That is, there were meetings with the top functionaries of the Los Angeles section. Mr. Manoff, Lawrence Ross, and a young man by the name of Jimmy Allen, who I believe at that time was agit-prop-Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee what is meant by the term "agit-prop"?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, agit-prop was an abbreviation for "agitaion and propaganda." In other words, later it became a little more anglicized they called him educational director. At that time they were known as agit-props. SMr. TAVENNER. Did you ever serve in the capacity of agit-prop
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, I am quite sure I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. For how long a period of time ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, that would be a little difficult to say, because I was in a number of units over a period of time, and I served in almost every capacity at one time or another. This was 18 years ago so it is a little hard to remember what unit.
Mr. TAVENNER. Without going into detail will you state at the present time the exact titles of the positions that you held while a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I was a unit organizer, dues secretary, an agitprop, I served on the county central committee, I served on finance committees which were, incidentally, made up of sympathizers of the party rather than party members, and also the reserve committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will ask you more about the reserve committee later. Did you also serve as a member of a secret committee of any character?
Mrs. ASHE. The reserve committee was a secret committee. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Now I would like for you to tell the committee where you first met with other Communists in Communist Party meetings.
Mrs. ASHE. You mean a street unit, perhaps ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mrs. ASHE. Well, the first street unit I attended was some place on Lemon Grove Avenue. I don't know the address.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know the name of the person in whose home the meeting was held
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. Rose Elfman's home.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name ?
Mrs. ASHE. I believe it was E-l-f-m-a-n, or double n, I don't know. I'm not sure about that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she known to you to be a member of the Com- munist Party?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, she was a member of the unit.
Mr. TAVENNER. In what other homes did you meet, that is engaged in Communist Party meetings? 
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. Well, I don't know how it is now, but in those days we met at a different home each week. And I would meet, well, for instance, Mr. and Mrs. Beaman were members of a unit to which I belonged. I don't know whether it is the same unit or another unit. I met in their home.
Mr. TAVENNER. I did not understand the last name.
Mrs. ASHE. Beaman, B-e-a-m-a-n. 1 2 Individual named by Harold J. Ashe, Morton Beeman.  1465 
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall the names of other persons in whose home you met ? 
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I can't. I'm sorry, because after we left Common- wealth House, for some reason, our house seemed to be the meeting place and so many unit meetings were held there. It is a little hard to remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, you mentioned Commonwealth House. What was the significance of your living in Commonwealth House ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, during the period that we were identified with the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party took a big home in Hollywood at Sunset and Vine-1453 is the address-and that was the Socialists' headquarters. It was a three-story house that at one time had been a mansion, the old Martin estate, and we were there as caretakers and made our home in the Socialist Party headquarters at that time. Then subsequently, when we transferred allegiance to the Communist Party, the Communist Party took over Commonwealth House. However, I do not remember any unit meetings at Commonwealth House because it was a rule of the party that no party meetings should be held because this was a house that housed all of the front organizations, such as the John Reed Club, the ILD, the 1WOMr. TAVENNER. NOW, just a moment. Will you give us the names rather than the initials of those organizations.
Mrs. ASHE. . K. The John Reed Club, which was a club made up of artists and writers and so forth, of Hollywood, mostly. The ILD was the International Labor Defense.
Mr. TAVENNER. International Labor Defense? 
Mrs. ASHE. I believe that's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. That's right. 
Mrs. ASHE. I am so used to just the initials. IWO is the Interna- tionl Workers' Order, which was an insurance kind of thing. It also housed the Partisan, which was a magazine published by the John Reed Club and various others. Oh, Schuler. This was a children's organization. Oh, and the YCL also met there.
Mr. TAVENNER. YCL; did you say?
Mrs. ASHE. Oh, excuse me. The Young Communist League.
Mr. TAVENNER. Young Communist League? 
Mrs. ASHE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you tell us a little more about the functioning of the John Reed Club. That is, when they began to function in Los Angeles. 
Mrs. ASHE. No; I don't know the history of the John Reed Club. I never was a member of the club, and I never was assigned to it as a party member.' (At this time Representative Donald L. Jackson entered the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Then you state that after leaving Commonwealth House many of the meetings were held in your home?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; that's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did that unit or cell have a name which met in your home and which you attended ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, no; because there were various units. We weren't in one unit very long. I mean, we were transferred around a great 1466 deal. I mean, if they needed an organizer, for instance, we moved in and acted as organizer. If they needed an agitprop, we moved in. So, we sort of pinch-hit from one unit to another.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your former husband has described the organiza- tion of two clubs or units known as professional clubs.
Mrs. AsHE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Z-100 and Z-150?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you identified with either or both of those clubs ' Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I helped organize the Z-100, and I remember when Z-150 was organized as a split from the original professional unit, but I am not sure which one I remained with.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to.the committee the names of those who were members of the professional club whom you can now recall? 
Mrs. ASHE. Well, Lionel Stander for a short time was in the Z-100. His wife Lucy was recruited into B-100. Jeff Kibre was a member.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell that last name, please?
Mrs. ASHE. K-i-b-r-e. And his wife Virginia was later recruited into the unit by Jack-John Broman, B-r-o-m-a-n. Jack Wilson was his name. John Broman was his party name. (At this point Representative Charles E. Potter left the room.)
Mrs. ASHE (continuing). Lou Harris and his wife Vera were in one of the units. I don't know which one. Herb Klein and his wife. Percy Solotoy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. Is Herb an abbreviation orMrs. ASHE. I don't know. I never knew him as anything but Herb Klein.
Mr. TAVENNER. What further information of a descriptive nature can you give of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Klein? Where did they live and what did they do ?
Mrs. AsHE. I don't know where they lived, except it was in Hollywood. I mean, I couldn't place the house. They were Hollywood people.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know in what business Mr. Herbert Klein was engaged?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I don't know what he was in then. I understand later he was a professor at City College.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how he may be employed now ?
Mrs. ASHE. No; I haven't been in touch with him for many years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you tell us anything about his activity while you were associated with him in this club? (At this point Representative Francis E. Walter left the room.)
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. Well, these units were more or less underground units. I mean, the people couldn't be exposed. There was a lot of work they couldn't do. For instance, they couldn't have attended a meeting like this as a party member. They couldn't go on a picket line. There were a lot of things they couldn't do. They wereMr. TAVENNER. Well, what was the reason for that? 
Mrs. ASHE. Well, if I may use the term, they were sort of sacred cows. I think they got a little to think they were so important that they couldn't be regular Communist Party members. They had to be extra special ultra. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1467 
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, is there anything you can tell us about the activity of Mr. Klein while a member of this unit?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, one of the activities of that unit was the forming of the New Music Group. It was a group to raise money. I mean, it was-the idea was to give concerts. Mr. Klein, as I remember it, had brought back a number of very wonderful recordings from Germany, and there were concerts given at which these recordings were played, and that sort of thing. I only attended one or two of those. That is about as much on that as I know, but that was one of the things that the unit was able to do. Spencer Austrian was also a member of that group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know what his position was ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I believe Mr. Austrian is an attorney.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you name others ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, the reason I speak of Mr. Austrian, almost every- one I have to remember in connection with some incident or something, because they- are not just names. I remember, for instance, that one of the functions that we had was to arrange for the mechanics of an underground. For instance, we raised money-I believe New Music Group money went in to buy an electric mimeograph.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you about to make any further statement regardingMrs. ASHE. Well, yes; I was.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Mr. Austrian?
Mrs. ASHE. Because at that time anyone who bought a mimeo- graph, or anything of that kind, had to be-it had to be registered with the Government somehow, and I am trying to remember how it was registered. I mean, I haven't thought of it in years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was this mimeograph machine to be used in any underground operations of the party ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; it was to be kept sort of-you know, quiet, until such time as it might be needed. I don't remember any other people at the moment. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know Morgan Hull?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I knew Morgan.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of that group?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; Morgan was a member, and his wife Charlotte. I believe Morgan afterward became head of the National Newspaper Guild. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know a person by the name of Percy Solotoy ? 
Mrs. ASHE. Percy Solotoy and his wife Sonya were recruited from the Contemporary Theatre.
Mr. TAVENNER. From what?
Mrs. ASHE. From the Contemporary Theatre group, which was another front group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were they members of this cell or unit of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, and I think Jeff Kibre recruited them. My recollection is that it was Jeff Kibre who recruited them.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS there anything else that you can recall regarding their activities ?
Mrs. ASHE. I attended a unit meeting at their home-they lived on Kings Road, and I did attend a meeting there, a unit meeting there, 1468 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY and Percy was very active in the Contemporary Theater work which staged left-wing plays.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say he was "active" in the theater in this particular theater group, do you mean to indicate that activity related to Communist Party work of any character
Mrs. AsH. Well, Contemporary Theatre was a front organization for staging left-wing plays. A number of plays were staged under the banner of the Contemporary Theatre, and Mr. Solotoy was very instrumental in organizing that and keeping it going.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you meet in Communist Party meetings with each of the persons whose names you have given 
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I did. Did I mention Lou Harris ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; you did. Now, in the course of your connection with the Communist Party, did you have occasion to meet Communist Party functionaries on a higher level?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I did, on numerous occasions. We met often with Hanoff. Elmer Hanoff, I think his name was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he also ,known as Pop Hanoff?
Mrs. ASHE. Pop Hanoff was organizer for the Los Angeles section when we joined the party. Lawrence Ross at that time was organization secretary. Jimmy Allen, who had charge of educational work. I also knew Sam Darcy, who was district organizer. I knew Louise Todd very well who, at one time, was organizer here. I knew John Leech. I knew Jim Thorne. I knew Rube Lambert. I think he spells it R-u-b-e L-a-m-b-e-r-t. I know Oleta O'Connor. That is all I recall at the moment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall Paul Klein?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, yes. I had very little to do with Paul. I think maybe Paul conducted a central council committee a time or two when I was a delegate. Other than that, I didn't know Paul. I didn't work under Paul at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you associated in any way with Pettis Perry I
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, I knew Pettis Perry very well. I don't know what his-I don't know what his official position as a functionary was, but I did know Pettis.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know him as a member of the Communist Party
Mrs. ASHE. Definitely.
Mr. TAVENNER. He is the same person who is now under indictment in California?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I wouldn't know, but I would say yes. He was a Negro comrade.
Mr. TAVENNER. You mentioned Louise Todd. Now, what was your first association with her ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, Louise came to Los Angeles to take over the organization job, and I worked with Louise a very great deal. I knew Louise very well, up to the time she went to Tehachapi, and even after, because I visited her at Tehachapi, and it was Louise who as- signed me to the reserve committee that you asked about a few moments ago. She also assigned me to act as collector for the party. That is, collecting from people who gave regular donations who were not Communist Party members, or, if they were, they were so underground that we didn't know it.  1469 
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, tell us more about your duties as a collector.
Mrs. ASHE. Well, my duties were-I had a list of people who con- tributed each month, and I contacted them at a place that they designated, picked up the money, gave them a receipt always made out to a name that would be comparable to a party name. I mean, their own name never went on a receipt, but they received a receipt that had the party seal on it, and I brought the money into the office.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was this?
Mrs. ASHE. In 1934. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What territory or area did you perform those serv- ices in?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, Los Angeles, Hollywood, a time or two I even went down to Malibu Beach. it was the Los Angeles area. It was southern California-I mean, 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you seek contributions from persons engaged in the moving-picture industry?
Mrs. ASHE. There were a few; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. In receiving those donations, did the donor under- stand the purpose for which the money was being given ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; they understood it perfectly.
Mr. TAVENNER. They understood that it was for the Communist Party?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; they understood that.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you gave them receipts in fictitious names?
Mrs. ASHE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us the names at this time of persons in the industry-moving-picture industry?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I can only give you a few. because my memory isn't good on it. J. Sanders was on my list. That is Lionel Stander, as he is known professionally.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently did he make contributions?
Mrs. ASHE. Once a month. I know he used to complain because he said he was a fatted cow for the party, and that was all.
Mr. TAVENNER. He was what?
Mrs. ASHE. A fatted cow. He was making a lot of money.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were these special contributions or were they dues?
Mrs. AsHE. No; they were not dues. They were voluntary contributions to the Communist Party for use in party work.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you receive donations from persons who were not members of the party ? 
Mrs. ASHE. Well, at the time I was collecting from Mr. Stander we didn't know he was a party member.
Mr. TAVENNER. How is that?
Mrs. ASHE. We didn't know he was a party member at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mrs. ASHE. This was before Z-100 and Z-150 were organized.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was after that that he became a member of the Communist Party Cell Z-100? 
Mrs. AsHE. Yes, that's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who else in the industry did you receive donations from 1470 
Mrs. ASHE. I also collected from a man by the name of Bright, who, at that time, was a writer at Paramount studios, and his partner whose name I do not remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. Any others which you can recall at the present time?
Mrs. AsHE. I also collected from Carl Dreher, who was identified with RKO studios, but I don't know in what capacity. It was a very technical thing and I don't know what his position was there.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was his first name?
Mrs. ASHE. Carl. ' Mr. TAVENNER. Carl? 
Mrs. ASHE. Dreher, D-r-e-h-e-r.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did each of those persons understand the purpose for the donations?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, they did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, are there others whose names you can now recall who became donors? 
Mrs. ASHE. I can't at the moment--oh, Joe Gollumb. I also collected from Joe Gollumb, who was a writer at Paramount.
Mr. WOOD. At this point the committee will take a recess for 15 minutes. (Whereupon a 15-minute recess was here taken.) (With all members of the subcommittee present the proceedings were resumed.)
Mr. WOOD. We will have order, please. Let the committee be in order, and proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Ashe, were you acquainted with Betty Bennett Gannett?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; Betty was active here in Los Angeles-I can't even recall the year. Maybe 1937, I would say. In 1937. She was in the office, but I don't remember what her capacity was. At one time she was educational director. I remember that, because I was an educational director for my branch and went with her in education branch-in section meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Charles Daggett?
Mrs. ASHE. Charles Daggett was a member of one of these profes- sional units, either Z-100 or Z-150. I don't know which unit he was identified with. I believe Morgan Hull recruited Mr. Daggett.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sit in Communist Party meetings with
Mr. Daggett?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently, would you say ?
Mrs. ASHE. That I wouldn't be able to say. It is a long time ago.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before tie recess you referred to having received certain directions or assignments from Louise Todd.
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; that's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. You also stated that you received an appointment at her hands to what was known as the reserve committee ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes-no-yes; that's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what was the reserve committee?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, the reserve committee was a very hush-hush topsecret committee composed of three people, and the purpose of the committee was to become so well identified with work in the State of  1471 California that we could take over and act as the top functionaries in this area in case the party was driven underground.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were named as one of the three persons to such a committee?
Mrs. ASIIE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date? When were you appointed to that committee?
Mrs. ASHE. I think about 1936.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were your associates on that committee ?
Mrs. AsIE. Ida Miller and Charley Young.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did this committee ever function?
Mrs. ASHE. No, not in the way that it was supposed to. I mean, we didn't go underground. We met frequently. In fact, this committee was so hush-hush that no one was supposed to know about it except the people that were on the committee. Even my husband was not supposed to know anything about the functioning of this committee. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, did that committee go through a course of training in preparation for its assignment? We were trained on where mail would be reMrs. ASHE. Yes. ceived, how addresses would be rotatedMr. TAVENNER. I doubt if the committee can hear you without the aid of the amplifying system. I think it is all right now.
Mrs. ASHE. All right. I don't think it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell us-I believe you did tell us who your associates were. Now, will you tell us what type of training you took in preparation for your assignment ?
Mrs. ASHE. We were trained in where to receive mail, how dues, stamps, and so forth would be received and distributed. We were given a code that would be used in sending messages back and forth between various points. We were taught that code. We were given messages to decode and we were taught to send messages in the code. In other words, we familiarized ourselves very thoroughly with the code that was to be used in the event it was needed.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you serve on that committee ?
Mrs. AsHE. Well, I didn't serve very long. A few months. The reason I was taken off of the committee, I was injured. I had an automobile accident which necessitated a 6-months leave of absence, and I never again served on that committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you learn who succeeded you on that committee ?
Mrs. ASHE. No, Ididn't. I have no idea.
Mr. TAVENNER. DO you have in your possession any documentary evidence of the giving of directions or orders to you by Louise Todd ?
Mrs. ASHE. I have a communication that I- carried when I made collections. In other words, as a responsible comrade, I presented a document to prove that I did represent the party and to make the people who were contributing sure that their money was going to the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you exhibited that when soliciting funds ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. That was my passport.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have it ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, I do have it. 1472 
Mr. TAVENNER. DO you have it with you ?
Mrs.ASHE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you exhibit it, please ?.
Mrs. ASHE. I will be glad to [exhibiting document].
Mr. TAVENNER. The letter which you have presented to the committee is on the letterhead of the Communist Party.
Mrs. AsnE. Yes, that is true.
Mr. TAVENNER. The heading is "Communist Party, 224 South Spring Street, Los Angeles, Calif." I will read the letter. NOVEMBER 9, 1934. DEAR FRIEND: This letter introduces Comrade Mildred Ashe who is authorized by the section committee of our party to accept your monthly pledge to our activities. We want to thank you again for this splendid help to the party. With comradely greetings, LOUISE TODD, Section Organizer. And then there is a stamp over the signature, Communist Party, District 13, Los Angeles Section, U. S. A. May we have the use of this letter for purposes of photostating it? We will be glad to return it to you.
Mrs. ASHE. All right. Having kept it this long I would hate to part with it for very long.
Mr. WooD. The committee will return it to your personal custody.
Mrs. ASHE. I am very happy to loan it to the committee. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I will offer the letter in evidence and ask that it be marked "Ashe Exhibit No. 1"-"Mildred Ashe Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. WooD. It will be received. 1
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have your Communist Party book that was issued to you?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I do have.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you present it, please.
Mrs. ASHE. All right [producing document].
Mr. TAVENNER. Does the book contain stamps showing the payments of dues?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; it does. I would like to call the committee's atten- tion, if I may, to one stamp in there, that is what is known as a solidarity stamp.
Mr. TAVENNER. Solidarity stamp ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. This is different than the monthly dues stamp. It was a stamp issued for assisting the underground movement in Germany which was fighting Hitler.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was a contribution to the establishment of under- ground work in Germany, underground work of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ASHE. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall the date of that stamp or the date when you purchased that stamp ? 
Mrs. ASHE. No. It is indicated in the book.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee more about the method used to obtain those contributions and how they were handled? 1 See appendix to be printed in separate volume for photographic reproduction.  
Mrs. ASHE. INDUSTRY 1473 Well, it was a regular assessment stamp, and I believe once a month or so you bought a solidarity stamp, and I think you paid the same amount for it that you did for your monthly stamp. In other words, if you paid 25 cents a month, if you were unemployed, or 10 cents a month, or whatever, then you paid the same amount for the solidarity stamp.
Mr. TAVENNER. The Communist Party book which you have handed the committee is for 1939, membership book, and it bears No. 8218. It shows on its face that the book was issued on February 16, 1938, and bears the signature of William Schneiderman. He is one of the Communists now under indictment, I believe. The book also contains-it has scheduled monthly payments, dues payments for 1939, a copy of the constitution of the Communist Party. I would like very much to borrow this from you with the idea of photostating it and returning it toyou.
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, sir; you may have it.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer it in evidence and ask that it be marked "Mildred Ashe Exhibit No. 2."
Mr. WOOD. It will be received for that purpose. 1
Mr. TAVENNER. Returning now again to your work on the secret committee, the reserve committee, who was the leader among that group of three who constituted that committee ?
Mrs. ASHE. Ida Miller was acting as instructor, with the under- standing that I would be the head of the committee. When we- 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you receive instructions from any person other than Ida Miller?
Mrs. ASHE. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any information of any underground activities of the Communist Party in this area ?
Mrs. ASHE. No. No; not underground.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you state you withdrew from the Com- munist Party ?
Mrs. ASHE. I withdrew in 1939. I don't know the month. It shows in the book, whenever the last stamp is. I should say about June of 1939 was the last time I paid dues.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before asking you to tell the committee the circum- stances under which you resigned, I would like to ask you just one or two other questions. Were you acquainted with a person by the name of Rose Bush ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I was. I knew Rose.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she a member or affiliated with the Commu- nist Party in any way ?
Mrs. ASHE. She represented herself as a member of the Communist Party. She came to Los Angeles as a very top secret comrade who had been in underground work in Germany and was here for the purpose of raising money for the German underground, and I worked with her to acquaint her with some of the people who might help her financially and arranged a meeting at the home of Joe Gollumb on Hillcrest Road.
Mr. TAVENNER. Joe who? 1 See appendix to be printed in a separate volume for photographic reproduction. 1474 
Mrs. AsHE. Joe Gollumb, G-o-l-l-u-m-b, and at that time Rose-Mr. Gollumb did get a group of people together. I don't remember any of their names, because none of them were familiar to me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I should ask you at this point, Was Mr. Gollumb known to you to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ASIHE. No; he was not.
Mr. TAV-NNNER. Do you mean by that you know that he was not a member ?
Mrs. ASTIE. No; I mean I-to my knowledge he was not a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you proceed, please.
Mrs. ASHE. And Rose Bush made quite a lengthy speech that night. Some of the people-well, frankly, they thought she was phony and asked her a little about Germany; and she said, well, that she hadn't brought anything out of Germany, that she had to come out with clean suitcases. In other words, she couldn't bring out any identification at all, but she did show credentials presumably from the executive committee of the Communist International on a little white satin ribbon.
Mr. TAVENNER. What did the white satin ribbon have written on it?
Mrs. ASHE. That I do not know. I don't remember, but that was her credential, and the reason I recall it is because when Lawrence Ross, who at that time was the organizational secretary, found out she had exhibited that in a public meeting, she was severely criticized for it. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you at any time learn anything further regarding the character of that identification, the white ribbon?
Mrs. ASHE. No. That is the only time I ever heard of a white rib- bon or saw the white ribbon, but I saw the white ribbon.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did Rose Bush spell her last name?
Mrs. ASHE. B-u-s-h. 
Mr. TAVENNER. For the benefit of the committee, may I say that the committee's investigation at an earlier date discloses that a similar ribbon was signed, for identification purposes, by Max Bedacht. Were you acquainted with Robert Minor, M-i-n-o-r?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I knew Robert Minor very well. Mr. Ashe toured the State of California with Mr. Minor on a speaking tour, and I tagged along. We were out maybe 2 or 3 weeks on a speaking tour. It was during the election campaign when Mr. Ashe was running for secretary of state for California.
Mr. TAVENNER. On the Communist Party ticket ?
Mrs. ASHE. On the Communist Party ticket. And at the same time-it was during that time that Mr. Upton Sinclair had his EPIC movement, the End Poverty in California movement.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee whether or not at this time the Communist Party dictated any change of policy with regard to the support that it should give to the candidates in that particular election ?
Mrs. ASHE. The decision in California of the-the executive committee in California had made the decision that the Communist Party should support Mr. Sinclair for Governor. When Mr. Minor came to California, he had meetings. I didn't attend the meetings, but I heard discussions of the meetings. Mr. Sinclair's program was one of cooperatives. He wanted to set up cooperatives in which people  1475 would grow their own food and make their own clothes; in other words, start eating. Mr. Minor reversed the decision of the California executive committee. He was a member at that time of the central committee, and I believe a member of the Communist International. He said that we should not support Mr. Sinclair, not because the program wouldn't work, but because the program would work too well. .I know that Mr. Ashe had to change all of his approach-I mean in his speaking-and that Mr. Minor spoke very strongly against
Mr. Sinclair. May I venture an opinion ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mrs. ASHE. In my opinion, if Mr. Minor had stayed home and the Communists had supported Mr. Sinclair, he would have been Governor. That's how much difference that decision made.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have 
Mrs. ASHE. May I add to that?
Mr. TAVENNER. I do not understand. 
Mrs. ASHE. May I add to that ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; if you would like to. 
Mrs. ASHE. Subsequently the decision was reversed, but the election was over. Then they decided they better get into the EPIC meetings and start working.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you give the initials of an organization, I wish you would follow it by the exact title.
Mrs. ASHE. Im sorry. End Poverty in California. I think Mr. Sinclair would like that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have any experience with the disciplinary committee of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. I had occasion to be before the disciplinary committee a few times.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe the way in which the disciplinary committee functioned and who were members of it.
Mrs. AsHE. Well, on one occasion Tashjian, Dr. Tashjian, the den- tist, was head of the disciplinary committee; Clara and Bill Ward were on the committee, and I believe that Nat Praeger, but I'm not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did the instance that you are referring to consti- tute that situation that developed which yotr husband described, where you were required to take a beginner's course over again?
Mrs. ASHE. No. That was another time.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was another time? If it is another time, will you tell us about it?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, this had to do with a decision that had been made by a joint fraction meeting of the Federal writers' project and the Federal theater project. All Communists who were working on those projects met together in this fraction meeting at the home of two comrades, Walter McElroy and Wilben Holther. We called him Wilben. I think his name was William Benjamin and his mother had contracted it to Wilben. At that time I had one of my assignments and that was as organizer of the American Writers' Union. 81595-51-pt. 4---5 1476 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY I believe at that time I was employed in the theater project as play reader. The head of that department, Mr. Pearlman, had had a play produced by the theater project, and tile man who was head of it, Mr. Miller, refused to pay him royalty. He had come to the American Writers' Union as a member and asked us to ask Mr. Miller's removal from the Federal theater project. The Dramatists' Guild at the same time had been asked the same thing, because Mr. Pearlman also belonged to the Dramatists' Guild. The Dramatist's Guild had supported him. They had sent letters asking for the removal of Mr. Miller. The American Writers' Union had to follow the fraction decision of the Communist Party members at this particular meeting and had voted not to support Mr. Pearlman. As a result we went into the American Writers' Union, and the only people who didn't vote to support it were the Communists, who are supposed to support workers when they are trying to raise wages. I voted to support Mr. Pearlman. In other words, I went against the fraction decision because I feltMr. TAVENNER. You deviated from the Communist Party instructiolts, or the Communist Party line?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; I did. I maintained it was a mechanical decision which Jim Thorme had forced on us, who at that time, I believe, was. the organizational Secretary and representing the executive committee on the Los Angeles section. I felt it was a mechanical decision. I didn't feel that if we were going to support the working class that it. was right n hen a thing came up to try to raise money, to get pay for work, that the Communists had any right to say we won't support that. So I supported it. As a result I was called before the disciplinarycommittee.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, that is an instance of Communist Party discipline for deviation from the decisions made on a higher level?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes: that is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who represented the theatrical group at this meeting; do you recall?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, that is a little difficult. Betty Arden was there; Mary Virginia Farmer was there; and aside from Mr. Holther and
Mr. McElroy I don't recall any other people.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you personally acquainted with Mary Vir- ginia Farmer?
Mrs. ASHE. No; I wasn't. I didn't know her.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where was she employed at that time? SMrs. ASHE. She was employed by the Federal theater project in rather a high capacity. I remember that one of my objections to the fraction meeting was that this woman presumably was never to be exposed as a Communist Party member, so they bring her into a fraction meeting that is not only a fraction meeting of the theater project but a joint meeting with the writers' project.
Mr. TAVENNER. By fraction meeting, are you referring to a meeting of representatives from different branches of the Communist Party?
Mrs. ASHE. No. I am referring-a fraction was made up all people who were Communist Party members who were working within any given organization or job or whatever. In other words, Communists work as a bloc.  1477 
Mr. TAVENNER. But in referring to a fraction meeting you were re- ferring to a Communist Party meeting? 
Mrs. ASHE. A Communist Party meeting, made up of Communist Party members in a joint fraction. In other words, the fraction from the Federal theater project and the fraction from the Federal writers' project were meeting jointly.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was at this Communist fraction meeting that Mary Virginia Farmer appeared and took part in the discussion?
Mrs. ASHE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO whom did you make your complaint about permitting her appearance and disclosure at this meeting ?
Mrs. ASHE. I don't believe I made a complaint. I think the com- plaint was made against me for going against party decision.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under which you severed your connection with the Communist Party eventually?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I started withdrawing from the party in 1936. I was injured in February of 1936. I had gotten so tired, so worn out, I was run dry. I felt that I was in a voluntary servitude that was becoming most involuntary. I was ill. I saw my marriage going on the rocks, and from February of 1936 I was not a very good Communist. It took me 3 years to sever all connections. It is like a race horse. A race horse gets to the winning line and then canters a little, you know, before they stop. Well, it took me 3 years to canter to a stop in such a way that nobody knew I was out. I did a MacArthur, I just sort of faded out.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you think led you more definitely than anything else to make the break from the Communist Party ?
Mrs. ASmE. I think I know what you are leading up to, but that is something that I did a few notes on. I can't say that I became so completely disillusioned with the Communist Party that I wanted to break with it. That came Irter. Be- cause when you are in the party you are in a state of mesmerism. As my husband stated, you don't think for yourself at all. You work 16 and 18 hours a day, you don't have enough food, you don't have anything. And after 3 years of that we got a little tired. I got tireder than anybody else, evidently. It wasn't until I was away from the party and had been away for quite a little while that I began to get perspective on it and began to realize what a vicious, rotten, subversive thing it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS your break with the Communist Party a definite and final break in all respects ?
Mrs. ASHE. If I thought that through any weird machination of fate I should ever again be put into the Communist Party I would rather open up my veins and let all the blood out of my body. I don't want any more Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. I notice, Mrs. Ashe, the dues book which you produced, in which the stamps are posted, does show the last posting as of June 1939. In this book, also, is the constitution and bylaws of the Communist Party of the United States. I don't find any place in it where 1478 there is any declaration of support of the Constitution of the United States.
Mrs. ASHE. No. 
Mr. DOYLE. No doubt you have read it. But I can't find anywhere where any member of the Communist Party is pledged to uphold the Constitution of the United States. Do you know of any such declaration ? 
Mrs. ASHE. No, there isn't. I don't know how other people feel. Personally, I am an American; I was born in Joplin, Mo., I am very proud of being an American, I am very proud of the flag and I am very proud of my citizenship. It never occurred to me that I was ever forfeiting any of that by belonging to this.
Mr. DoYLE. I have studied it, too, the last 30 minutes that you have been testifying so helpfully. With reference to this stamp which you identified as the international solidarity stamp, I find a section of the constitution and bylaws which specifies that that shall be spent, the moneys raised thus, shall be spent entirely for the aid and help of brother Communists in other countries.
Mrs. AsHE. That is correct. 
Mr. DOYLE. I notice, however, that the letter of identification which you also let the committee use, specifies that you were authorized to accept monthly pledges.
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. It says nothing about monthly dues.
Mrs. ASHE. Well, these were not party members that I collected from, you see. 
Mr. DOYLE. That is as far as you knew you were
Mrs. ASIIE. As far as I knew; that's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. I remember you said that on one occasion you discovered later they had been party members.
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. But as far as I knew they were sympathizers.
Mr. DOYLE. In this constitution and bylaws book I find that on this solidarity stamp there is a provision that every 4 months all members of the party shall pay an assessment equal to average dues payment per month for the previous 4 months. That that is the money that goes for the solidarity stamp. In other words, it is apparently a particular fund which is-collectible only once in 4 months? 
Mrs. ASHE. Yes.
Mr. DOTLE. And is equal to the monthly assessment for 4 months. Do I understand from your testimony that there was a considerable list of people whom you did not know to be Communist Party members who made monthly pledges ? Was it a long list of people ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, I had a long list, but I wasn't always able to con- tact them. I mean, there were people on the list, but they were people that somebody else maybe came in and said, "Look, so and so is sympathetic, why don't you send somebody out and see if you can raise some money from them ?" 
Mr. DOYLE. About how many would you say were on your list?
Mrs. ASHE. I would say there were maybe 20, 25 names on that list. 
Mr. DOYLE. No doubt there were other collectors who had similar lists?
Mrs. ASHE. I think not. At that time I think I had the only one. 
Mr. DOYLE. What do you suppose the largest sum was that you ever thus collected from any one person at any one time ?  1479 
Mrs. ASHE. Not very much. I wouldn't say more than $40 or $50, maybe as much as a hundred.
Mr. DOYLE. What classification of an individual would pay that much as a special pledge, do you remember ?
Mrs. ASHE. They were people who were making quite a bit of money. I mean, they were people who were working in the studios and got good salaries.
Mr. DOYLE. I notice you referred to the YCL. That is the Young Communist League?
Mrs. AsHE. Yes; that is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. You also mentioned that there was a children's organ- ization; is that one and the same ?
Mrs. ASHE. No. The YCL was made up of young people between the ages, I would say, maybe 12 to 18, or something like that. I mean the adolescents. The Schuler was an organization of Jewish children who were brought together-I think-about once a week I think they met. And what they actually were being instructed in was the language, the Jewish language, and so forth. Whether they got party line or not, I don't know.
Mr. DOYLE. But under the auspices of the Communist Party? 
Mrs. ASHE. I believe that was a separate organization, but the parents were Communists.
Mr. DOYLE. You would say then that all of the parents of those children who were being thus instructed were Communists ?
Mrs. AsHE. I would say that the majority of them were.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, as to the YCL. How extensive an organization was that ?
Mrs. ASHE. Well, it was quite extensive. As a matter of fact, I think the membership of the YCL must have closely approximated that of the party.
Mr. DOYLE. Did the party spend money and hire people to work in this YCL, which was the children's work ?
Mrs. ASHE. No; they didn't hire any. They assigned you. As a matter of fact, I was assigned to the YCL one time for 2 or 3 weeks until something else came up. You weren't paid, you just took whatever assignments were handed to you. For instance, if I went into the Young Communist League I would go as a representative of the party, offering whatever advice I could to them. But they were a pretty self-sufficient group of people. I mean, these kids had their own parties, they had their own money-raising things, they did their own recruiting. Their line was formed along the party line with the help of a party member.
Mr. DOYLE. To what extent were they educated in and encouraged to participate in learning and accomplishing the Communist Party program?
Mrs. ASHE. They use exactly the same party line, the same literature, the same everything that the older comrades used. They had instruction every so often, I mean like once a week or so they had their regular educationals. It was formed like the adult Communist Party.
Mr. DOYLE. Would you say then that the adult Communist Party was placing emphasis upon the YCL?
Mrs. ASHE. There were times I thought the YCL was placing em- phasis on the party. I mean, they were much more militant in many ways than the party was. They were quite a crowd. 1480 COXMMINISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. DOYLE. Those were children then of junior and senior highschool age, I understand?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; they were. 
Mr. DOYLE. How did they pick the young people to join the YCL? Where did they come from?
Mrs. ASHE. They picked themselves. They went out and recruited members just exactly the way the Communist Party did.
Mr. DOYLE. Did they have any dues?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; they had dues. • Mr. DOYLE. I think that's all.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Mrs. Ashe, I believe you mentioned in the course of your testimony that you made several trips to Malibu ?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you identified those persons whom you called upon in Malibu?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, I have. J. Stander had a home down there, and I collected from Jay when he had his home in Malibu. Lionel Stander.
Mr. JACKSON. Previous testimony before the committee has been introduced to indicate that there was a tithe system of payment in addition to the monthly dues, which was sometimes based upon the weekly or monthly earnings of the individual.
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; that's correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Did these individuals whom you contacted in this regard pay on that basis ?
Mrs. ASHE. I don't know, because I didn't know them as Communist Party members. I only knew them as people who were sympathetic to the party and were willing to contribute to the party on a monthly basis.
Mr. JACKSON. During the period of time that you acted in that capacity can you give the committee on estimate of the amount of money that you collected ? I realize it would have to be a very rough approximation.
Mrs. AsHE. It would. In fact, it is virtually impossible to do it. I would like to be helpful, but I couldn't.
Mr. JACKSON. Was it in the hundreds or was it in the thousands? 
Mrs. ASHE. I would say in the hundreds.
Mr. JACKSON. In the hundreds of dollars?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. I understand, and it has been reiterated time and time again, that there is no such thing as independent judgment, so far as a Communist is concerned, or so far as the Communist Party is concerned.
Mrs. AsiE. That is correct. The individual counts for nothing, everything is the mass. The individual as an individual is not impor- tant. I would like to illustrate that, if I may.
Mr. JACKSON. Please do. 
Mrs. AsHE. This, incidentally, has to do with another disciplinary committee meeting. We had Dr. Tashjian to contend with, as you have heard, and he was a little worried because some of the married couples in the party were in the same units, and he contended that they went home and discussed everything and came back and voted as a block. So he tried to put through a ruling that married couples COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1481 were not permitted to belong to the same unit. Incidentally, we picketed the party. It is probably the only time in the history of the party that the party was picketed.
Mr. JACKSON. The husbands and wives picketed the party in protest?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes, we did. And we carried banners.
Mr. JACKSON. Then there is no such thing, obviously, as objective debate over which of two alternate courses of action should be followed ?
Mr. ASHE. That is exactly the situation.
Mr. JACKSON. In sum then, you can say that a member of the Communist Party is simply a machine with no human reactions, so far as his ability to think independently or to act independently are concerned ?
Mrs. ASHE. That is very correct.
Mr. JACKSON. He is a robot who is entirely responsible to an alien philosophy and an alien doctrine and owes no allegiance to the United States of America?
Mrs. AsHE. That I will stop you on just a moment. I want to illustrate it. For instance, I remember someone asked Mr. Earl Browder whether or not he would permit his children to salute the American flag. He said, "Certainly. It's their flag." ,AsI stated before, I had no feeling myself that I had given up anything in the way of citizenship rights, and it was only until I was away that I began to realize that the propaganda is so insidious and so constant, and wears you down to such an extent that you find yourself voting and working for Mr. Stalin.
Mr. JACKSON. Of course, Mr. Browder fell into disrepute in the Communist Party.
Mrs. ASHE. This, I believe, was even before that. Maybe that was one of the things that put him in disrepute.
Mr. JACKSON. Without respect to what your feelings were, or what your thoughts were at the time you were a member, is it true that you have since come to the position I stated a few minutes ago, that a member of the Communist Party is a robot without any independence of action?
Mrs. ASHE. He has absolutely no opportunity to do anything for himself. For one thing he doesn't have time. You know, they talk about exploiting the working class. Believe me, the capitalist system can learn something about exploitation, the way they exploit their members.
Mr. JACKSON. In the event of war between this country and the Soviet Union, where would the average Communist, out of your experience, be found; on the side of the United States or on the side of the Soviet Union?
Mrs. ASHE. On the side of the Soviet Union.
Mr. JACKSON. There is no question in your mind as to that?
Mrs. ASHE. Absolutely not.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no more questions, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. PoTTER. Mrs. Ashe, you mentioned in your testimony your ac- tivity as a member of a fraction. I think that many people would like to have you elaborate on that and explain just what a fraction is. But before you do I am wondering if this is not the case. The Com- 1482 munist Party was charged with a responsibility, a duty to set up fractions in as many mass organizations as possible; is that not correct?
Mrs. ASHE. That is correct.
Mr. PorrER. If three or more members of the Communist Party are in a mass organization they automatically establish that fraction; is that true
Mrs. ASHE. That is correct.
Mr. POTTER. Then your fraction, or your Communist members of a mass organization meet and determine the Communist policy line and, try to apply that Communist Party line within the mass organization; is that not true?
Mrs. ASHB. Yes. Then when there is a meeting of the organization they go in and vote as a block.
Mr. PorrER. They vote as a block
Mrs. ASHE. Yes.
Mr. POT ER. And by so doing, acting with a singleness of purpose, many fractions of very few in number can control mass organizations of hundreds of people; is that not correct?
Mrs. ASHE. Yes; that's true.
Mr. POTTER. That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Thank you very much, Mrs. Ashe, for your appearance here and for your valuable testimony before the committee.
Mr. Counsel, is there any reason why this witness should not be excused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WOOD. It is so ordered. Who do you have next ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Michael Gordon.
Mr. WOOD. Are you Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Gordon, will you hold up your right hand and be sworn. You solemnly swear the evidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God
Mr. GORDON. I do. TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL GORDON, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, A. L. WIRIN
