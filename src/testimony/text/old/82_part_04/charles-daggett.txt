Mr. TAVENNER. Did you at any time sign a petition to put the Com- munist Party on the ballot in the primary election in 1932 ? 
Mr. DAGGETT. I am afraid you are trying to link me with a sub- versive organization, and I shall have to decline to answer that question on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. WooD. Without anticipating what he is seeking to do, sir, the question as asked was did you sign such a petition. What is your answer ?
Mr. DAGGETT. My answer is that I shall decline to answer it, Congressman.
Mr. WooD. Very well.
Mr. DAGGETT. On the grounds stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. WellMr. WALTER. Let's get it on the grounds that the Communist Party is a subversive organization ?
Mr. DAGGETT. On the ground of the fifth amendment, sir. I think the answer I made is quite clear.
Mr. WALTER. It wasn't to me. I understood you to say that you did decline to answer because Mr. Tavenner was trying to link your name with a subversive organization.
Mr. DAGGETT. Correct.
Mr. WALTER. I was just wondering what that organization was.
Mr. DAGGETT. He named it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Mr. Harold Ashe ?
Mr. DAGGETT. I shall have to decline to answer that question on the same ground previously stated.
Mr. WooD. Just a moment. You don't have to decline to do anything here, sir, unless you desire to do it, so don't-please don't leave the inference that you are under any compulsion to decline to answer. The question is, Do you decline to answer ?
Mr. DAGGETT. I do decline to answer; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you present during the testimony of Mr. Harold Ashe.
Mr. DAGGETT. Part of the time; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear that part of his testimony in which he referred to his acquaintanceship with you ?
Mr. DAGGETT. May I consult my attorney? [Consulting counsel.] Yes, I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear him say that in 1939 he procured from you a copy of the report-the 1938 report of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities.
Mr. DAGGETT. I decline to answer that question on the ground of the fifth amendment. 1490 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you mentioned in that report made by the Committee on Un-American Activities in 1938? Is that the ground why youMr. DAGGETT. I don't believe I was. I don't recollect having been mentioned.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then what was there about that report which might -the giving to Mr. Ashe might constitute some criminal offense?
Mr. DAGGETT. I decline to answer that question, Mr. Counsel, on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear that part of Mr. Ashe's testimony in which he stated that you were a member of Z-100, the secret professional clubMr. DAGGETT. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of the Communist Party ?
Mr. DAGGETT. No, I didn't hear that. I was out in the hall during part of his testimony. I didn't hear that part.
Mr. TAVENNER. You did not hear that?
Mr. DAGGETT. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, I am stating to you that that was his testi- mony. Were you a member of Z-100 or Z-150 ?
Mr. DAGGETT. I decline to answer that question on the grounds I have previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. And what was that ground ? 
Mr. DAGGETT. On the ground of the fifth amendment, that you are attempting to link me with a subversive organization, and that I may incriminate myself by answering the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, by testifying or admitting that you were a member of that organization you might subject yourself to criminal prosecution?
Mr. DAGGETT. I shall have to decline to answer on the same ground,
Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear Mrs. Ashe testify ? ' Mr. DAGGETT. Part of her testimony. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear that part of her testimony in which she stated that she sat in many Communist Party meetings with you?
Mr. DAGGETT. I heard her mention my name, but I didn't hear all of that testimony that you are quoting because I was in the hall smoking a cigarette while she was on, and I could hear her mention my name.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you known Mrs. Ashe ?
Mr. DAGGETT. I shall have to decline to answer that question.
Mr. WooD. Please don't state you have to decline to do anything. The question is, Do you decline or don't you?
Mr. DAGGETT. All right, I will try to remember that. I do decline.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever sit in a Communist Party meeting with Mrs. Ashe ?
Mr. DAGGETT. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Daggett, you have made the statement at least on three occasions during my examination of you that I was endeavoring to link you with a subversive organization. Now, I want to make it very plain that I am giving you every opportunity for you, yourself, to disassociate yourself with any such organization, if you  1491 are a member, or to disavow it if you are a member. I am giving you the opportunity to unlink yourself. Do you care to take advantage of that opportunity?
Mr. DAGGETT. Are you asking me a question ? 
Mr. assuredly; yes.
Mr. DAGGETT. Can you phrase it again so that I can get what it is, clearly ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you desire to unlink yourself from the subversive organization which you say I am trying to link you with?
Mr. DAGGETT. Well, I shall decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well, sir. I have no further questions. TAVENNER. Most
