Miss FARMER. Mary Virginia Farmer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss or Mrs.?
Miss FARMER. Miss. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now reside?
Miss FARMER. In Van Nuys.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California?
Miss FARMER. Since 1936.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation or profession? 
Miss FARMER. I am an actress. 
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged as an actress in the State of California? 
Miss FARMER. I think that I began my acting in motion pictures in 1940, possibly. About 1940, 1941-I'm not sure which.
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to that time how were you employed?
Miss FARMER. My first professional engagement as an actress was in 1921, in stock with Jess Bonstelle, in Buffalo. My first professional Broadway engagement was, I think, in 1925 in a play called Stone and Fruit, produced by Mr. A. H. Woods. I played for various Broadway engagements after that. I came to California in 1936, as I said, through the Federal theater project, for which I was engaged in the East by Mr. J. Howard Miller, the regional director of the 11 Western States, to direct, to assist in production, and to establish a training and retraining system for the actors on the project.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee briefly what your general education has been.
Miss FARMER. Yes. I went to the public schools in Montclair, N. J., graduated from high school.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that the place of your birth?
Miss FARMER. No. I was born in Indianapolis, Ind. I was living in Montclair, N. J., with my parents and went to the public schools, graduated from high school there. I then traveled in the West with my mother, the West of this country, with my mother for a year and came back and went for a year to the Baldwin School, in Bryn Mawr, Pa., a girls' boarding school. In New York-Bryn Mawr is near Philadelphia, and I also studied singing in Philadelphia at that time. In New York, in the next several years, I added to my education by 2 years' study in many aspects of the drama in the extension systems of Barnard College and Columbia University. I also studied acting with Mildred Holland at that time, a well-known retired American road star, and at the studio in Carnegie Hall of the great German naturalistic actor, Emanuel Reicher. Subsequently I finished-I won't say finished my educational background, but to bring it somewhat up to date, I did 2 years' study in psychology in the extension system of the University of California at Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. You mentioned the fact that you came to California in connection with the Federal theater project.
Miss FARMER. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that date, please?
Miss FARMER. That was September. I went to work-I was assign- ed on the project and I think I went to work the day after Labor Day, 1936. 1738 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hold a position of importance with the Federal theater project?
Miss FARMER. I don't know that it was of particular importance. I was what is known as an administrative supervisor. That, however, was a general title. I didn't do any kind of administration whatsoever. I suppose that related to salary, that title. I did what I was brought out for. I directed plays, I instituted and taught and supervised some training work, actors' work, the technique of acting. And I assisted in production-in the supervision of productions, "that is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have any other duties in connection with your assignment to the Federal theater project other than you have just described?
Miss FARMER. Not that I can remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain an official of the Federal theater project?
Miss FARMER. I think it was' April or May 1939.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear the testimony of Mrs. Ashe who testified on the first day of the hearings here in Los Angeles
Miss FARMER. Yes, I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Mildred Ashe.
Miss FARMER. I heard her.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Ashe, as you recall, testified that there was a fraction meeting of the Communist Party within the Federal theater project on one occasion to her knowledge which you attended. Do you recall that?
Miss FARMER. Mr. Tavenner, to this question-on this question I invoke my privileges under the first and fifth amendments of the Constitution and I decline to answer it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Ashe testified in substance that she was surprised and that she complained about the fact that you had been permitted, a person of your importance had been permitted to attend a fraction meeting of that type because of the possibility of disclosure of your connection with the Communist Party. Have you any comments you desire to make about her testimony with regard to that ?
Miss FARMER. This seems to me to be the same question from another angle and I decline to answer it on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Martin Berkeley, in the course of his testimony, identified you as a member of the Communist Party within the moving picture industry. Was he truthful in that statement or untruthful ?
Miss FARMER. I decline to answer this question on the same grounds that I have previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any knowledge of the functioning of the cultural commission of the Communist Party within the moving picture industry ?
Miss FARMER. I decline to answer this question on the same grounds and for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you reside in 1937?
Miss FARMER. In Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us the address?  1739 
Miss FARMER. No, I don't think I can give you the number. I think that has escaped me. I believe it was Montana Street, or something of that sort.
Mr. TAVENNER. Montana Avenue?
Miss FARMER. Yes, it could be.
Mr. TAVENNER. Could 1350 be the correct address ?
Miss FARMER. This I really don't recall. It might be.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Miss FARMER. Mr. Tavenner, as in all such questions relating to that organization I decline to answer, and I stand on the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter, any questions?
Mr. WALTER. No questions. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson ?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter? 
Mr. POTTER. No questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Is there any reason why this witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance ? 
Mr. TAVENNER. NO, sir.
Mr. POTrR. Mr. Chairman, the witness has given the committee a statement.
Miss FARMER. May I submit a statement?
Mr. WOOD. It will be received, yes. The witness will be excused from further attendance,
Mr. TAVENNER. Louise Rousseau.
Mr. WOOD. Witness Rousseau, will you raise your right hand and be sworn, please. You do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Miss ROUSSEAU. I do. 
Mr. WOOD. Be seated. TESTIMONY OF LOUISE ROUSSEAU, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT W. KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS
