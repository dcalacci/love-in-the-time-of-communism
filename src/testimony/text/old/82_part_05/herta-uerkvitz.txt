Miss UERKVITZ. I am.
Mr. WOOD. Will counsel identify himself for the record.
Mr. KENNY. Robert W. Kenny of Los Angeles.
Mr. WOOD. During the progress of your interrogation, Miss Uerkvitz, you are permitted to confer with your counsel as often as you deem necessary and to seek such advice and information and suggestion from him as you think you need for your examination. (Representative Charles E. Potter left the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER.
Miss UERKVITZ.
Mr. TAVENNER.
Miss UERKVITZ.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state your full name, please ? Herta Uerkvitz. Will you please spell it? H-e-r-t-a U-e-r-k-v-i-t-z. Would you mind sitting a little bit closer to the table ? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Thank you. Are you a native of California?
Miss UERKVITZ. I am not. I was born in Wisconsin.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California ?
Miss UERKVITZ. Since 19-in California?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Miss UERKVITZ. Since 1922.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation?
Miss UERKVITZ. Architectural research.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged in that pro- fession ?
Miss UERKVITZ. Since 1936, I believe, in the same studio.
Mr. TAVENNER. What special training did you have for that work, and in that connection state what your general education has been.
Miss UERKVITZ. My general education was in the public schools of Everett, Wash., and a business college there, and a 2-year extension course in UCLA after I came down here. Now, I have no special training for the job, I worked into it by a set of happy circumstances.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged in that work? 81595-51-pt. 5- 5 1700 
Miss UERKvrrz. As I said, I have been in the motion-picture indus- try steadily since 1922, and in this particular architectural field, specifically in charge of a department since 1936.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was at one of the studios in the movingpicture industry, I assume?
Miss UERKVITZ. I have been at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since 1929. Previous to that I was in several other large studios.
Mr. TAVENNER. Having been an employee in the moving-picture industry over the period of time you have indicated, you are in a position to have learned a great deal regarding the subject of the inquiry which this committee is interested in, namely the extent of Communist infiltration into the moving-picture industry in Hollywood and the extent of it and the general purposes of it and the method which the Communist Party may have used to promote its projects. So I would like to ask you if you have knowledge regarding the activities of the Communist Party in the moving-picture industry, whether it be in your field, that of the screen writers, the directors, or any other field.
Miss UTERKVITZ. Mr. Tavenner, I will have to call upon my privilege under the first and fifth amendments and refuse to answer the question, because the organization which is in the question as being-Mr. TAVENNER. There were several organizations mentioned. Are you referring to the Communist Party ?
Miss UERKVITZ. I will still have to stand on my fifth amendment privilege.
Mr. WOOD. Miss Uerkvitz, please, as far as this committee is con- cerned, there is no compulsion. You don't have to invoke anything. It is just a question of whether you do or not.
Miss UERKVITZ. I will have to stand on that ground. 
Mr. WooD. You mean that you do stand on it, that you do claim the privilege of the fifth amendment?
Miss UERKVITZ. I do, sir.
Mr. WOOD. All right. Well, you don't have to, you know, here. 
Miss UERKvrrz. I do, if I don't want to get myself in hot water.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't understand that remark. This committee is not engaged in the prosecution of anyone. It is simply an investigation of facts, and I would like to give you the opportunity again to tell us what you know about this subject, if you will.
Miss UERKVITZ. Again, I will have to rely upon my privilege of the fifth amendment and decline to answer.
Mr. WOOD. Well, do you so rely on your privilege?
Miss UERKVrrZ. I certainly do rely. It is the only thing I have left to rely upon.
Mr. WOOD. Well, the statement that you have to do it is not literally true, because this committee doesn't put you under any compulsion. It is a question of what you do.
Miss UERKVITZ. Well, the committee has put me under compulsion to this extent: The naming of so many dozens and dozens and dozens of organizations as subversive-I noticed that in the United States circuit court of appeals a couple of weeks ago they describe the Attorney General's list of subversive organizations as based purely upon hearsay.
Mr. WOOD. I am afraid COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1701 
Miss UERKVITZ. Now, this may be true and it may not be true, but I don't want to jeopardize myself, and that is why I use the fifth amendment.
Mr. WOOD. I am afraid you don't understand my situation about it. What I am trying to say to you is that when you say you have to rely on the fifth amendment, it is not an answer to the question at all.
Miss UERKVITZ. Well,.I'm sorry, sir, I will have to consider it so for me.
Mr. WOOD. Well, do you? 
Miss UEiKVITZ. I do decline; yes, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Very well, and for the reason that you have stated, under the protection of the fifth amendment?
Miss UERKVITZ. Protection against possible incrimination.
Mr. WOOD. It will simplify the procedure with us and with yourself if, instead of saying you have to say, that you do do it, if you do.
Miss UERKVITZ. I see. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you in the hearing room yesterday during the period that Mr. Martin Berkeley was testifying?
Miss UERKVITZ. I was here in the afternoon.
Mr. TAVENNER. NOW, while you were here did Mr. Martin Berkeley describe you as a former member of the Communist Party ?
Miss UERKVrrz. He didn't mention me at all while I was in the room. 
Mr. TAVJ)NNER. Well, during the course of his testimony, probably while you were absent, he did state that he knew you to be a member of the Communist Party. I would like to ask you whether or not that was a truthful statement or whether it was false.
Miss UERKVITZ. Well, that reminds me of a tale on witch hunts where a 5-year-old child was condemned because a man testified that he saw devils running out of her mouth. However, I will stand upon my right of the fifth amendment and refuse to-decline to answer the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Miss UERKVITZ. I will again have to rely upon the fifth amendment.
Mr. WooD. Do you so rely ?
Miss UERKVITZ. I do so rely upon it.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter, do you have any questions ?
Mr. WALTER. Yes. You have stated that "I will get in hot water unless I rely on the fifth amendment." What did you mean by that?
Miss UERKVITZ. I explained myself earlier, but I don't want to discuss it further, if I may so not discuss it.
Mr. WALTER. You just decline to answer that question, is that it?
Miss UERKVITZ. I just do not care to discuss it further.
Mr. WALTER. I can understand that, of course.
Miss UERKVITZ. I am sorry. 
Mr. WALTER. That is all right. Now, you have answered the question. Do you know that under the law nothing coming from the lips of any witness in this hearing can be used in any case against them ? Do you know that ? Do you know it, Mr. Kenny ?
Mr. KENNY. Yes; and I disagree heartily with you.
Mr. WALTER. You do ? 1702 
Mr. KENNY. The law is exactly the contrary to that which you stated.
Mr. WALTER. Then I shan't pursue it further, but I will mail you the statute so that you are aware of the situation. That is all. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Counsel, any further questions? \Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WooD. Any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WOOD. So ordered.
Mr. KENNY. Mr. Chairman, I do have a client here under subpena who is a dentist, and if he is not to be heard today he will run into considerable problems because he is a one-man office and has many appointments for tomorrow. Is there any opportunity that this doctor can be heard today?
Mr. TAVENNER. What is his name ?
Mr. KENNY. Dr. Schoen, or he could come at some later time.
Mr. WooD. We only have 5 minutes until we have to adjourn.
Mr. KENNY. Yes; I realize that.
Mr. WALTER. It is Mr. Kenny's client. It will be very short.
Mr. TAVENNER. We will endeavor to help you out by fixing a time during tomorrow that will be convenient to him.
Mr. KENNY. I will try to work out-Mr. TAVENNER. Within reason.
Mr. KENNY. A time certain when he could appear; yes. 
Mr. WooD. Until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, the committee stands in recess. (Whereupon at the hour of 4: 35 p. m. an adjournment was taken in the above hearing until the hour of 10 a. m. of the following day, September 21, 1951.) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 5 FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1951 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif.
