Mr. RICHARDS. I am.
Mr. WOOD. Will counsel please identify himself for the record?
Mr. KENNY. Robert Kenny, of Los Angeles.
Mr. WooD. You may proceed. Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mr. Robert Richards?
Mr. RICHARDS. I would like to raise a question. I don't know whether I am being on television here or not, but I see the television cameras here. Are they in operation?
Mr. TAVENNER. It is assumed that they are. I never know when they are and when they are not.
Mr. RICHARDS. Is there any question as to my privilege of being on this television or not?
Mr. TAVENNER. I should think if you have any objection to it, the chairman and the committee will consider your objection and act upon it. 
Mr. RICHARDs. Yes; I think I do, if you have no objection to my objection.
Mr. WOOD. That is a qualified objection. If you objectMr. RICHARDS. Yes; I do. (Discussion off the record among members of the committee.)
Mr. WOOD. It is the decision of the committee that your objections will be respectedMr. RICHARDs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. And you will not appear on any television that is in the room.
Mr. RIcHARDS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you instruct them that the television be cut off?
Mr. WOOD. The television people are instructed not to televize this witness.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. RichardsMr. WALTER. Just a minute, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. WooD. In view of the fact that television facilities are--may I have attention, please?
Mr. RICHARDS. I beg your pardon. 
Mr. WooD. That the television facilities are permitted in the hearing room through the courtesy of the committee I am sure that it isn't necessary for me to caution them with respect to the directive that has been given now that the witness is not to be shown on television.  1641 
Mr. RICHARDS. I hadn't understood, Mr. Chairman I'm sorry. This means, then, that my face will not appear on television but my voice will; is that correct?
Mr. WOOD. Your voice will appear whether the television is in here or not.
Mr. RICHARDS. That is true. I understand. 
Mr. WooD. There is no difference in the character of the testimony that you will give here now than it would be if these television cameras were not in the room.
Mr. RICHARDS. I understand perfectly, sir. 
Mr. WOOD. Is that satisfactory ?
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes, indeed. By all means.
Mr. WOOD. You may proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please state your full name, Mr. Richards.
Mr. RICHARDS. Robert Loring Richards.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Richards ?
Mr. RICHARDS. I was born in New York City, March 1, 1909.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation?
Mr. RICHARDS. I am a writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been a writer?
Mr. RICHARDS. I have been a writer since about 1936.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee briefly what your educational training has been for the practice of your profession ?
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes. I attended the Horace Mann School in New York City--high school-and graduated from Harvard College in 1932.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state briefly what your record of employment has been ?
Mr. RICHARDS. I worked for Time, Inc., for about 7 years. I was a writer for and subsequently producer of the March of Time radio program. screen. I was an associate producer of the March of Time on the That is, the documentary-the newsreel. I left Time mag- azine and worked in an advertising agency for about a year, in radio. I came out to Hollywood about the end of 1942, did some radio, joined the merchant marine, subsequently went into motion pictures. I have been employed for about-I am a little vague on dates-about 4 years quite steadily, writing screen plays in the motion-picture in- dustry.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you state that you came to Hollywood ?
Mr. RICHARDS. I think it was the end of 1942. I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, in 1942 the Communist Party line, as it was recognized in this country, was the establishment of a second front. Of course, anyone had the right to sponsor the establishment of a second front. We are interested now in learning the extent to which the Communist Party line, which had consisted of that principle, was advocated by organizations influenced by the Communist Party. If you have any information on that subject the committee would like to have it.
Mr. RICHARDS. I must-I shall-I will decline to answer that ques- tion on the grounds of possible incrimination and claim my privileges under the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the United States to so deny-to so decline to answer that. 1642 COiNMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, there appeared an article in the September 14, 1942., issue of the Daily Worker to the effect that the League of American Writers was sponsoring the immediate opening of a second front, and I hand you the article in question. It appears from this article that your name was endorsed to this plan as sponsored by the League of American Writers. I am interested only to the extent of your participating in it as a member of the League of American Writers.
Mr. RICHArNs. Your question, then, is \ Mr. TAVENNER. Whether or not you did take part in that publiciz- ing as indicated by the press.
Mr. RICHARDS. I shall decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the November 3, 1947, issue of the Hollywood Reporter, there appears an advertisement contributed by the Actors' Division of the Progressive Citizens of America.
Mr. RICHARDS. I beg your pardon, sir, I did not hear the date.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. The date was November 3, 1947.
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes.
Mr. TA-ENNER. I will hand you the article referred to so that you may have it before you. Now, this advertisement proclaims that the Thomas-Rankin committee must go. Now, I raise no objection to anyone criticizing this committee or its predecessor, but we are anxious to know the extent to which the Communist Party imposes its thought, if any, upon other organizations in opposing the work of this committee or its predecessor, so after having looked at the article will you identify it as an advertisement in which you participated as one of the signers. Air. RICHARDS. I shall decline to answer that question, sir, on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Richards, the committee is in possession of information indicating that you were transferred from the Communist Party-as a member of the Communist Party in the city of New York in 1944 or 1945 to membership in the Communist Party in Hollywood, and at the time you were transferred your book number was 41786. I would like for you to tell the committee whether or not you were transferred as a Communist Party member from New York to this area.
Mr. RICHARDS. I shall decline to answer that question, sir, on the grounds that I have previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Carl Winter?
Mr. RICHARDS. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. There was an individual whose name was mentioned either yesterday or the day before by the name of Harry Appleton, of whom it was said that he was an executive member of the Bay Cities Communist Club of the Los Angeles County Communist Party during the year 1944. Were you acquainted with him?
Mr. RICHARDS. I, of course, shall decline to answer this question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever attend a Communist Party meeting at which he was present?
Mr. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that question, also, sir, on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you live in 1944 ? COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1643 
Mr. RICHARDS. That is a tough one. 1944?
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it at 607 Ocean Front?
Mr. RICHARDS. I believe it was, yes. In Santa Monica, I believe. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you renting the property at the time?
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes; I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee whether any meetings of the Communist Party were held at 607 Ocean Front while it was being rented by you ?
Mr. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that question, sir, on the grounds of possible self-incrimination, relying upon my privilege under the fifth amendment of the Constitution to so do.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe you named some of your screen plays
Mr. RICHARDS. No, sir. You never asked me about my screen plays. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I did not?
Mr. RICHARDS. NO, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I think we should know just the general type and character of your work, if you will let the committee have that information, as to the major screen plays with which you have been accredited.
Mr. RICHARDS. I will be glad to. I wrote my first-my first screen credit was a picture called One Sunday Afternoon, for Warner Bros. It was a musical. My next screen credit was a picture called Act of Violence for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer That was about an informer. My next credit was a picture at UniversalMr. WooD. Will you pardon me just for a moment at this point.
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes, indeed.
Mr. WOOD. There may be those in the audience who have not been here previously, so I announce again that this committee will not condone or countenance any sort of demonstration, favorable, unfavorable, or otherwise, in this hearing room during the conduct of these hearings. I hope that I won't have to repeat that admonition again.
Mr. RICHARDS. Do you wish me to proceed, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. I would be very glad for you to do so.
Mr. RICHARDS. By a curious coincidence my next screen credit for Universal-International was a picture called Johnny Stoolpigeon. My next credit was, I believe, written in collaboration, a picture called Winchester '73, a western. Let me see, there were others. There was a picture called Air Cadet, there was a picture called Kansas Raiders. I have worked on several others that I didn't do enough work on to get credit, if you understand what I mean. That is a pretty representative list of my credits.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have been informed in the course of our investigation that virtually all of those who worked as writers were members of the Screen Writers' Guild. I assume the same thing was true in your case?
Mr. RICHARDS. I was a member of the Screen Writers' Guild; yes. I still am, to the best of my knowledge.
Mr. TAVENNER. In 1949, which was some time after the first hearings before this committee in 1947, I believe there was a contest of special interest in the guild regarding the election of officers. At that time, Albert Maltz, who has been identified a number of times in the course of this investigation by witnesses as having been a member of the Communist Party, was a candidate for membership on the executive board. This was in 1949. Of course, every member had the 1644 right to the free expression of his choice in the election of officers, and I am not attempting to criticize, by inference, you or any other person for exercising that right.
Mr. RICHARDS. Are you asking me, sir, who I voted for in this election ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I am going to ask you a somewhat similar question. We are anxious to know whether or not Mr. Albert Maltz was sponsored in that election for that position by a fraction of the Communist Party or by members of the Communist Party who were members of the guild. In that connection we have noted that you have signed a petition nominating Mr. Maltz for that position. With that knowledge, it occurred to us that you could inform us about that.
Mr. RIcHARDS. I must decline to answer that question, sir, on the grounds that I have previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter, do you have any questions of the witness?
Mr. WALTER. Yes. 
Mr. Richards, are you a member, or were you a member, of the actors' division of the Progressive Citizens of America?
Mr. RIcHARDS. I shall decline to answer that question, sir.
Mr. WALTER. You are a member of the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. RicHARDS. Yes; I am a member of the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. WALTER. Why do you very frankly admit your membership in the Screen Writers' Guild and decline to answer the question of whether or not you are a member of another organization?
Mr. RICARDps. I am informed, sir, that-(The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. RIcHARDS. I am under no compulsion to give my reasons for declining to answer any questions.
Mr. WALTER. I don't know where you got that information, but if your lawyer has given you that information I think you ought to get another lawyer, because you can't decline to answer any question that you just don't feel like answering.
Mr. RICHARDS. I did not say that.
Mr. WALTER. That is exactly what you said.
Mr. KENNY. In justice to myself, Mr. Walter, since my advice has been taken into question, I advised him that no witness who has declined to answer a question is under any compulsion to give his reasons for that declination because the reasons are the same in effect as the question itself, or rather an answer to the question itself. If you do suggest that I was wrong in representing himMr. WALTER. Distinguished counsel from California is well aware of the circuit court decision, in your own circuit, which held that where a witness decided he was not going to answer a question innocent on its face, if in fact that question could not incriminate him, then he, of course, is responsible for the consequences of his failure to answer that instant question.
Mr. KENNY. I am afraid we will bore other people with a discussion, but it goes to reasons.
Mr. WOOD. Let's don't enter into any legal discussions, gentlemen.
Mr. WALTER. I notice on this Hollywood Reporter of November 3, 1947, the Committee on Un-American Activities was described as the Thomas-Rankin Committee. Now, of course, Mr. Rankin never was in a position where this committee could bear his name, and the fact  1645 that this propaganda sheet-that you will not admit that you had anything to do with-contains the name indicates to me, and I ask you whether or not this is a fact-whether you know anything about it-Mr. Rankin, coming from Mississippi, and with the kind of legislative record, which is a matter of record, which he has, his name wasn't used only for the purpose of trying to inflame minority groups against the activities of the committee directed by the Communists of the United States.
Mr. RIcHARDs. I am afraid, sir, that the question might tend to link me to an exhibit which is considered to be subversive. 
Mr. WALTER. I am sure linking your name with that of Thomas- Rankin would in no wise incriminate you. I have no further questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle? Any questions you have?
Mr. DOYLE. You stated, Mr. Richards, that you were and still are a member of the Screen Writers' Guild ?
Mr. RICHARDS. That's right, sir. 
Mr. DOYLE. Were you ever a member of the board of directors thereof? .Mr. RICHARDS. To the best that I can recall, and I am sure I can recall it, I never held any office in the Screen Writers' Guild. Never. I never stood for election and never was elected.
Mr. DoYLE. You say you neverMr. RICHARDS. I just never ran for any office. I am afraid I wasn't a very good guild member. I didn't go to many meetings.
Mr. DoYE. You attended the meetingMr. RICHARDS. I attended some of the meetings; yes. 
Mr. DomE. What is there, if anything, in your judgment about membership in the Communist Party, if you ever were a member thereof, which might incriminate you if you admitted or stated you were?
Mr. RICHARDS. IS that the question, sir ?
Mr. DOYLE. Quite correctly so. 
Mr. RICHARDS. I thought you were going to say something further. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you know whether or not the Communist Party is listed as a subversive group by the Attorney General or by this committee?
Mr. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that question, sir, on the same grounds.
Mr. DOYLE. Have you ever read the statute or the text of the statute under which this committee is functioning here this morning?
Mr. RICHARDS. I have not read it, sir, but I have heard it mentioned several times, and I think, in a general way, I am familiar with it.
Mr. DOYLE. What have you heard about it and when and where?
Mr. RICHARDs. I have heard about it here in this committee room. 
Mr. DOYLE. Oh, yesterday ?
Mr. RICHARDs. I believe it was yesterday. I am not sure. I really don't remember, but I have heard you speak of it, and I have heard youMr. DOYLE. What do you remember me speaking of it?
Mr. RICHARDS. I remember your saying that Congress had empow- ered this committee to investigate subversive activities. I believe that is approximately the gist of it. 1646 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. DOYLE. That is correct. Well, now, assuming that you agree with Mr. Webster, that "subversive" indicates uprooting and upturning, complete overthrow and destruction, would you say whether or not you have an opinion, and if so, what is your opinion ? Don't you think that is a good definition?
Mr. RICHARDS. This is a question of opinion, sir.
Mr. DoLE. I know, and I am asking your opinion.
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes. Well, I will try to give you my opinion as best I can on this rather complex question. ,Mr. DOYLE. There is nothing complex about it.
Mr. RIcHARDS. To me it seems so.
Mr. DOYLE. It is very simple.
Mr. RICHARDs. To me it seems so. The Congress of the United States has passed that law. It is the law of the land. I will at all times obey the laws of my country, and that is why I am here before this committee. I happen to disagree with that law. Nevertheless, it is under the law certainly your right and duty to conduct this investigation which you are doing. Does that answer the question?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes; and I wish to assure you that we are not trying to embarrass anyone that does disagree with the law.
Mr. RICHARDS. May I say something here on this question of opinion ?
Mr. DOYLE. Well- 
Mr. RICHARDs. I may have opinions, some of which may be unpop- ular, unorthodox, or even totally erroneous. I must strongly maintain, sir, my right to hold these opinions, and I further believe it is the sacred duty of everyone in this room to maintain my right to hold those opinions.
Mr. DoYLE. This committee would not disagree with that patriotic duty of anyone to hold their own opinion; but, in like manner, young man, I believe as a Member of Congress and as a fellow citizen of yours that it is also your duty, as an American citizen, when Congress enunciates a law, to help carry that law into effectiveness; and I just wanted to state to you frankly that when you hide behind the fifth amendment, which you have the right to do under your constitutional rights, you are not cooperating with this committee in trying to put into effect the law, in my judgment. Now, you gave your opinion, I have given you mine. My time is up, and therefore I will yield back to the chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson, I will yield to you. Any questions you may have?
Mr. JACKSON. I think in your opening statement you made mention of or used the word "informer" in several of your answers. What is your definition of "informer"?
Mr. RICHARDS. Mr. Jackson, I merely said in connection with the picture that it was about the informer.
Mr. JACKSON. I understand. 
Mr. RICHARDS. As a matter of fact, I might add, the informer in this picture was treated quite sympathetically.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know what an informer is?
Mr. RICHARDS. An informer, I would say, by definition, is a man who gives information.
Mr. JACKSON. An informer, according to the dictionary, is one who gives information with respect to a criminal conspiracy or criminal  1647 activities. That is to say, no one has ever given information regarding the Knights of Columbus, The B'nai B'rith, the Girl Scouts, or the Boy Scouts. Do you believe that in informing on Communists and Communist activities one is giving information with respect to criminal activities?
Mr. RICHARDS. I am sorry, sir; I must decline to answer that question on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you believe the Communist Party to constitute a conspiracy?
Mr. RICHARDS. I must decline to answer that question, sir. I shall decline. I beg your pardon.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you oppose any method of changing the Constitution of the United States except those that are set forth in that Constitution ?
Mr. RICHARDS. I most certainly do, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you oppose the overthrow of the Government by force and violence ? 
Mr. RICHARDS. I most certainly do, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you served in the Armed Forces of the United States? 
Mr. RICHARDS. I have not served in the Armed Forces of the United States; no, sir. I was in the merchant marine.
Mr. JACKSON. Would you serve in the Armed Forces of the United States if conceivably, such service meant taking arms against the Soviet Union?
Mr. RICHARDS. I would defend my country, sir, in the event of an attack from any source whatever.
Mr. JACKSON. Including the Soviet Union?
Mr. RICHARDS. Including the Soviet Union; yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. No further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. You, Mr. Potter?
Mr. PorTER. Mr. Richards, in reply to a question by my colleague 
Mr. Doyle, we are greatly concerned about the freedom of opinion of individuals. Now, it is interesting to me to note that persons who are members of the Communist Party are greatly concerned about individual opinions, while those same members are denied, within the party, the expression of those opinions. Now, I have here a document which I have read from many times during the course of this investigation. It is the manual on the organization of the Communist Party which many members have-many former members of the party have-informed the committee has served as more or less of a bible for membership in the party. Now, I would like to read you one paragraph of this manual of the Communist Party concerning the every expression of opinion, and I quote.1 We cannot imagine a discussion, for example, questioning the correctness of the leading role of the proletariat in the revolution, or the necessity for the proletarian dictatorship. We do not question the theory of the necessity for the forceful overthrow of capitalism. We do not question the correctness of the revolutionary theory of the class struggle laid down by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Now, that is the end of the quotation. Now, when the party, itself. limits even the discussion which will question the basic principles of the party as mentioned here, to claim that this committee in some way I See appendix printed in a separate volume. 1648 might hamper the expression of an opinion is-it puts the person in a contradictory position. That is no question. It is just a statement which I wish to relate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Counsel, any further questions of the witness?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO, sir.
Mr. WOOD. I am not sure I got the full import of the witness' answer to the question as asked him with reference to whether or not he would willingly bear arms on behalf of the Government of the United States in the event of an armed conflict.
Mr. RICHARDS. May I repeat my answer, sir? I beg your pardon. 
Mr. WOOD. I am going to ask you a question. I understood you to say that you would do so in the event of an attack on the United States.
Mr. RICHARDS. From any source whatsoever; yes, sir. 
Mr. WooD. Any source whatsoever. Let me go a little further with it. Suppose such a conflict conceivably was brought about by a declaration of the constituted authorities of America in order to withhold world-wide aggression. Short of an attack, what would be the attitude you would take?
Mr. RICHARDS. I would assume, sir, that the only way that the United States could become involved in war is by a threat, an attack, an aggressive threat against the territories of the United States, and so my answer stands. I don't see-I don't get the distinction. I really don't.
Mr. WooD. Maybe I can simplify it by asking you this simple ques- tion: Do you approve of the present conflict that is being waged in Korea ?
Mr. RICHARDs. That is a matter of opinion, sir.
Mr. WooD. Do you care to express one ?
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes. Yes; I think I had better. This seems to me an extremely difficultMr. WOOD. I would rather you answer the question and then if you desire to make any explanation of your answer, all right.
Mr. RICHARDS. Mr. Wood, this is a matter of opinion. If you don't mind I must answer it in my own way. 
Mr. WOOD. Let's have a direct answer first and then you can ex- plain it. 
Mr. RICHARDS. Mr. Wood, unless I can answer this question of opinion in my own way I shall not choose to answer it from this forum at all.
Mr. WooD. In other words, you would not give a simple answer as to whether or not you approveMr. RICHARDS. It is not a question of a simple answer. This is not a simple question. The whole business of the Korean thing is a big question and there is a vast difference of opinion of all kinds on this question. 
Mr. WooD. By that do you mean you approve part of it and dis- approve other portions? 
Mr. RICHARDS. Do you want a yes or no answer to that? I cannot give you a yes or no answer, sir; I cannot. 
Mr. WooD. I have no objection to you going into a dissertation except in the interest of time. We don't want to furnish a forum here for a stump speech about it. I was simply seeking to ascertain  1649 whether you are in opinion with the United Nations forces in its efforts to suppress Communist aggression in the world. That is a simple question and it ought to have a simple answer.
Mr. RICHARDS. Let me say that I believe that it was an error-an error.
Mr. WOOD. That is a simple answer. 
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes. great many people. I think that this opinion is shared by a I am heartily in favor, I hope, that this con- flict will be settled under the present peace negotiations.
Mr. WOOD. We all devoutly hope that, sir.
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes; I am sure we do.
Mr. WOOD. I am not sure that I understood what you meant when you said that it was an error. I assume that you meant it was an error on the part of the United Nations forces.
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes; I think it was. I think there is still room for dissenting opinion in this country, Mr. Chairman. I do not think that one is subversive because one holds a dissenting opinion. I think it is our right to hold a dissenting opinion.
Mr. WOOD. That is true, because there are a lot of people in Amer- ica who have some misgivings on the subject.
Mr. RICHARDS. Yes, there are, and I am among them. I think it is a tragic thing. I feel that the sooner it is over the better. I sincerely trust that it will lead to nothing further. I cannot imagine anything more calamitous for not only this country or for the entire human race than the extension of this conflict.
Mr. WooD. I think Mr. Jackson has another question he would like to ask.
Mr. RICHARDS. I don't want to make speeches.
Mr. JACKSON. Has any effort been made by counsel or by this committee to alter your opinions or to stifle your opinions or change them
Mr. RICHARDS. NO, sir; no effort has been made that I can see here.
Mr. JACKSON. Have your constitutional rights been observed ?
Mr. RICHARDS. My constitutional rights have been observed.
Mr. JACKSON. Nothing further.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter, do you have additional questions ?
Mr. POTTER. Yes; just one short question. Do you contend that the Communist Party is dedicated to defend the Soviet Union?
Mr. RICHARDS. I shall decline to answer that question, sir, on the previously stated grounds.
Mr. POTTER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Counsel, do you have additional questions for the witness? 
Mr. TAVENNER. NO, sir, I do not.
Mr. WOOD. Do you know of any reason why the witness should not be excused from further attendance on the committee?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WooD. It is so ordered. Whom do you have next, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Ellenore Abowitz.
Mr. WOOD. Has Mrs. Abowitz come in yet
Mr. KENNY. Apparently not yet. She lives way out in West Los Angeles and she said 45 minutes. she will arrive. I suppose almost momentarily  
Mr. WooD. It there another witness that you can use at the moment, or would youMr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Ann Roth Morgan Richards.
Mr. WOOD. Mrs. Richards, will you raise your right hand and be sworn, please? You do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I do, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Have a seat, please. tESTIMONY OF ANN ROTH MORGAN RICHARDS, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT W. KENNY
Mrs. RICHARDS. I am not very photogenic and I don't want television, either.
Mr. WooD. You do not want television? First I will ask you if you are represented here by counsel.
Mrs. RICHARDS. I am, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Mrs. Richards, do you object to the still photographs here before you begin your testimony ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. Not before, but not during, because it blinds you.
Mr. WOOD. Then I will have to ask the photographers to take what. pictures they desire now. (The witness conferred with counsel.)
Mr. WOOD. Mrs. Richards has indicated a disinclination to be tele- vised in the giving of her testimony so I issue the same instruction and direction to the operators of the television cameras that I did a moment ago, and that is that she is not to appear on the television screen at any time during the progress of the testimony. You may proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your name, please?
Mrs. RICHARDS. Ann Roth Richards, also known as Ann Roth Morgan. Roth is my
Mr. WOOD. I don't believe the witness was interrogated as to whether or not she has counsel.
Mrs. RICHARDS. Yes.
Mr. KENNY. Yes. The lady is represented by Robert W. Kenny, of Los Angeles.
Mr. WOOD. You have the right, Mrs. Richards, at any time during the progress of your interrogation to confer with your counsel as fully as you desire and to obtain from him any advice or information that you may seek or be in need of. And, of course, your counsel, Mr. Kenny, having been before this committee many times previously, is. aware of his privileges in connection with representing you here. 
Mrs. RICHARDS. Thank you very much.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you reside, Mrs. Richards?
Mrs. RICHARDS. In Sherman Oaks.
Mr. TAVENNER. I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Mrs. RICHARDS. Sherman Oaks, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California?
Mrs. RICHARDS. Oh, about 25 years now, I believe.
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to that time where did you reside ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I was born in Minneapolis, Minn., and lived there until I came to California. COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1651 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever reside in the city of New York ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I spent 8 months there, I believe, during 1936 and 1937, and I have made one visit there since. I have never lived there permanently.
Mr. TAVENNER. I wish you would raise your voice a little bit more. It is very difficult for us to hear you over here. I understood that.
Mrs. RICHARDS. I don't to see my face. I thought

Mrs. RICHARDS. I am a housewife, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you engaged in any profession or occupation other than that of being a housewife ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I, prior to my marriage, worked as an administra- tive secretary for several organizations for many years. SMr. TAVENNER. When was that ? When were you married ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. 1949. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to your marriage what organizations did you serve in a secretarial capacity for?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that, Mr. Tavenner, for fear of incrimination, and I invoke my privileges under the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you employed at any time by the Screen Writers' Guild in a secretarial capacity?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that on the same grounds, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you mean to state that you consider that employment by the Screen Writers' Guild constituted a type of employ- ment that might subject you to criminal prosecution if you divulged that fact'?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that on the same grounds,
Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have here before me a pamphlet, a 1938 pamphlet, entitled "Who's Who In Defense Of Democracy." (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. On page 40 of this pamphlet there appears the names of the officers of the several New York chapters. When I say "chapters," I mean chapters of the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which was an organization. The name of Ann Roth appears as chairman of the Benson Hurst chapter in Brooklyn. Will you examine page 40 of this pamphlet and state whether or not you were the chairman of that organization?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that on previous grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the course of the testimony of Mr. Martin Berkeley, reference was made to Ann Roth Morgan as being a person known to him to be a member of the Communist Party here in Los Angeles. If you were such a member I would like to ask you questions relating to such information as you may have, or within your knowledge, regarding the activities of the party here and the extent 81595-51-pt. 5- 2 1652 of its infiltration here. Was his testimony, in which he named you as a member of the Communist Party, true or false?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I decline to answer that on previous grounds. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name is Ann Roth Morgan ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. Well, I like to think of myself as Ann Roth Rich- ards. Roth is my maiden name. Morgan was the name of a previous husband who is dead. So I really am Ann Roth Richards.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you have been known as Ann Roth Morgan, also, of course?
Mrs. RICHARDS. Yes. Until I married Mr. Richards.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Might I inquire the approximate date? I believe you have given the date of your marriage but I don't think you designated which one, the first one or the second one. What was the date of your marriage to Mr. Richards?
Mrs. RICHARDS. December 25, 1949.
Mr. WOOD. I yield to Mr. Walter for any questions he may have.
Mr. WALTER. Mrs. Richards, the Screen Writers' Guild has never been designated as a subversive organization by the Attorney General of the United States, by this committee, or any other organization, so far as I know. That being the fact, why do you decline, or did you decline, to answer the question as to whether or not you were employed by that organization ?
Mrs. RICHARDS (after conferring with her counsel). I decline to answer that question, Mr. Walter, on the same grounds.
Mr. WALTER. On the grounds it might incriminate you to answer the question I have just propounded?
Mrs. RICHARDS. On the previously stated grounds and under the privilege of the fifth amendment.
Mr. WALTER. Then you considerMr. WOOD. Please answer a little louder so I can hear you.
Mr. WALTER. I can understand her. Then you are of the opinion that the fifth amendment permits peo- ple to select whatever questions they feel like refusing to answer; is that it?
Mrs. RICHARDS. That is a legal question, Mr. Walter, and I prefer you discussed it with my legal counsel. I refuse to get into any legal discussions.
Mr. WOOD. You have the privilege of discussing it with your counsel.
Mrs. RICHARDS. Did you ask a question? I didn't think you asked a question; I thought you asked for an opinion. If it is a legal opinion I will consult with my counsel, but I would have to give it to you second-handed. 
Mr. WALTER. No further questions.
Mr. DOYLE. No questions. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter?
Mr. PorrER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions by counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. It may not have been plain from her testimony as to whether or not she is the wife of Mr. Robert Richards who just preceded her on the witness stand.  1653 
Mrs. RICHARDS. Yes. I am very proud to say so, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. That's all.
Mr. WOOD. Any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WooD. It is so ordered.
Mrs. RICHARDS. Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Kenny, has your witness arrived
Mr. KENNY. The only thing I can do is telephone again, or perhaps by the time you have another witness she should be here.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I will call another witness. In the meantime, Mr. Kenny, would you mind checking on the progress she is making?
Mr. KENNY. Assuming that the next witness is not also a client of mine.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to give you time now to check up on the itinerary.
Mr. WOOD. If you are going to do so we are going to have a break in the hearings anyway, so what about taking 15 or 20 minutes recess. - We will stand in recess for 20 minutes. (A recess was here taken.)
Mr. WOOD. Let the committee be in order. Mr. Counsel, are you ready to proceed?
Mr. TAVENNER. I undertand Mrs. Abowitz is here now.
Mr. WOOD. Are you Mrs. Abowitz ?
Mrs. ABOWITZ. Yes, I am, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WOOD. Hold up your right hand, please, ma'am, and be sworn. You do solemnly swear the evidence you give this subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mrs. ABowrrz. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Are you represented by counsel, Mrs. Abowitz?
Mrs. ABOWITZ. I am. 
Mr. WooD. Will counsel please identify himself for the record.
Mr. KENNY. Yes; I am Robert W. Kenny of Los Angeles.
Mr. WooD. Mrs. Abowitz, be seated, and I would like to inform you that under the rules of this committee of long standing you have the right to confer with your counsel at any time during the progress of your interrogation and obtain any advice or suggestions which you find yourself in need of.
Mrs. ABowrrz. Thank you.
Mr. WooD. Counsel having been before this committee on frequent occasions is familiar, of course, with his rights under the rules of the committee.
Mrs. ABowrrz. Does one speak into any special microphone here?
Mr. WOOD. I can't hear you.
Mr. KENNY. I tell you, just speak at Mr. Tavenner over there and everybody will hear you and the mechanics will be taken care of.
Mr. TAVENNER. If you can speak so I can hear you they will all hear you.
Mrs. ABOWITZ. Well, I can hear you, Mr. Tavenner. I first want to say that I am very sorry to have inconvenienced all of you gentlemen this morning. However, television is a very fine medium. At least five people called me up because they were watching the session here, and a neighbor called me up and said, "Ellenore, you better get down there immediately. You are going to be arrested." So I told her 1654 my problem, and she offered to drive me down the hill. I live on a. very high hill, and it is 3 miles from the closest public transportation, so I wish to thank the television station, and I am sorry if I have inconvenienced any of you.
