Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mr. Jeff Corey?
Mr. CoREY. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Corey?
Mr. COREY. I was born in New York City, August 10. 1914.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession?
Mr. CoREY. I am an actor.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you engaged in your profession in California ?
Mr. COREY. I am really not, sir. My name was brought up at an earlier committee hearing and since then I have been gray-listed, if not completely black-listed. Hitherto I had been quite busy as an actor, but my professional fortunes have waned considerably, coincident with the mentioning of my name.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say your name was mentioned in connection with the work of this committee, are you referring to the testimony of Mr. Marc Lawrence given in WashingtonMr. COREY. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Which, I believe, was April 24, 1951. Do you know
Mr. Marc Lawrence?
Mr. ComRY. I know him as an actor who played an informer; with great verisimilitude, in a picture called Asphalt Jungle.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you associated with him in a Communist Party cell or group?
Mr. COREY. Mr. Chairman, I am cognizant of my privileges as a citizen, and I will stand on the first and fifth amendments of the United States Constitution and on article 18 of the Declaration of Human Rights as passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, which reads in part, if I may paraphrase it, that everyone shall have the right to freedom of conscious thought and religion, the right to change his belief or religion in private or alone, in public or on community with others to so manifest his belief. 1734 
Mr. WooD. Well, the directives of the United Nations are not as yet the law of this land and offer no protection to the witness for refusing to testify. If you base your declination to answer that question upon the fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, that is in force and is respected.
Mr. COREY. Yes; specifically i regard to the prior question, I am very proud to use my privileges, as I understand them, according to the first and fifth amendments of our noble Bill of Rights.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever attend a Communist Party meeting with Marc Lawrence?
Mr. COREY. Mr. Counsel, that is approximately the same question, I am sure you will agree with me, and my answer remains the same.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is not necessarily the same. You may have some explanation if such a thing occurred.
Mr. COREY. Specifically, I decline, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. If you decline to answer, that is the end of it as far as we are concerned, sir. That is a sufficient answer here.
Mr. COREY. Sir, I was trying to facilitate matters. 
Mr. WOOD. You will facilitate by answering the questions. We will get along a lot faster.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Actors' Laboratory ?
Mr. COREY. For some desire, ironic, strange reason, I believe, Mr. Counselor, that name has been put on.a subversive list by the Attorney General and possibly by other groups who have cataloged organizations and periodicals and as a consequence I stand on my privileges under the fifth amendment.
Mr. WOOD. And decline to answer ?
Mr. COREY. Yes; I decline to answer. If I said I decline to answer in regard to all future questions, can we come to an agreement that I base it on the fifth amendment for purposes of economy?
Mr. WooD. It will be so designated and it will save a lot of time, unless you designate otherwise. 
Mr. COREY. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Southern California chapter of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council?
Mr. COREY. Well, that organization, too, has merited acceptance on a number of lists, and I decline to answer that on these same grounds as now revised, sir.
Mr. WOOD. By the wayMr. COREY. Yes, sir? 
Mr. WooD. We might also expedite the hearing by simply making your reply without recounting the status of the organization mentioned, because I believe the committee is fairly familiar with the status of these organizations.
Mr. COREY. I don't want to sound like a parrot repeating these things. I have a great sensibility toward sounds and words, being an actor of some sensitivity. I will try to restrain myself. I just hate repeating a thing again and again, particularly when I think there is some importance to what I say, and there have been so many misapprehensions as to its use, hiding behind, cloaking yourself. I stand on the fifth amendment very proudly.
Mr. WOOD. You have already said you do on that question. That is sufficient.
Mr. COREY. I was rather surprised to have this- COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 1735 
Mr.'WooD. It is very embarrassing having to listen to a stump speaker.
Mr. COREY. I am not running for office.
Mr. WooD. Not here.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. I yield to a member of the committee, Mr. Walter. Any questions
Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle, have you any questions ? 
Mr. DOYLE. I notice, Mr. Corey, in answer to the first declination which you madeMr. WIRIN. You say declination or declamation ?
Mr. DOYLE. Declination.
Mr. WI N. I thought you said declamation. 
Mr. COREY. I was guilty of both declinations and declamations, apparently.
Mr. DOYLE. I heard you in both. I noticed you said that you stood upon your rights both as to the first amendment and the fifth amendment.
Mr. COREY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. DOYLE. Now, I wondered what the first amendment had to do, if anything, with your declining. I don't understand that that involves the question of possible incrimination.
Mr. COREY. Well. I just-I do feel, and I-apparently you and I might be in opposition to this point of view-that my rights of freedom of conscious thought, as embodied in the Bill of Rights, are violated by my being summoned and interrogated in front of this hearing.
Mr. DoLE. I know, but you don't claimMr. COREY. So I mention it.
Mr. DOYLE. I see.
Mr. COREY. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. That answers my question.
Mr. COREY. I feel thatMr. DOYLE. No, that answers my question. I didn't ask you for a stump speech.
Mr. WIRIN. Now, Mr. Doyle. I say, now, Mr. Doyle, is that the prerogative only of Congressmen ?
Mr. WOOD. Let the witness answer the questions.
Mr. WIRIN. I wasn't referring to Mr. Doyle. 
Mr. DOYLE. I think that is all.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson ?
Mr. JACKSON. Has your freedom of speech been abridged in any way, Mr. Corey?
Mr. COREY. Well, it isn't-I think that probing into one's thoughts and conscience-I will put it this way. I believe that no one can bargain for the key to my brain wherein is stored multitudinous attitudes about life, religion, politics, and art. You may try to ferret it out against my consent, butMr. JACKSON. You are afraid freedom of speech is goingMr. WIRIN. May he continue to answer the question
Mr. JACKSON. No, I have heard the speech 50 times.
Mr. WnIN. Not this one, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. The same one, with variations. That's all. 1736 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter?
Mr. POTTER. I have no questions.
Mr. COREY. I seem to have worn you gentlemen out successfully.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions ?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. I have no questions, sir, but in response-I can't let it go unchallenged-to your opening statement here that your employment has been interfered with by some vague reference to blacklisting on account of the activities of this committee, let me call to your *attentionthe fact that if there is any obstruction in the path of your future employment by reason of your appearance before this committee, we have given you as good a forum as you can possibly find to relieve yourself from the effect of the implication that is now in everybody's mind by reason of your declining to answer the question that you. are a member of the organizations about which you have been interrogated, and I just wanted to make this little observation, sir, 'and I am speaking now for myself, only. I don't want to speak for the remaining members of this committee, but if, by any action of this committee, we could be instrumental in eliminating from the field of public entertainment the views of people-particularly the youth of this country being moved to a large extent-people who decline to answer a question as to whether or not they are members of the Communist Party, it would make me extremely happy.
Mr. COREY. May I
Mr. JACKSON. May I associate myself with that?
Mr. COREY. Sir. may I makeMr. WooD. With that, you are excused from further attendance on this committee, sir. That wasn't a question, that was a statement.
Mr. COREY. Thank you.
Mr. WOOD. Who are you calling?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mary Virginia Farmer.
Mr. WooD. Come forward, please.
Miss FARMER. May I ask for the privilege, as I am an actress, not to be televised, either in motion pictures or in still pictures ? Just press photographs.
Mr. WooD. Do you object to being photographed?
Miss FARMER. Not for the press.
Mr. WooD. Would you gentlemen withhold your pictures just a moment and let me administer the oath. You do solemnly swear that the evidence you will give this subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Miss FARMER. I do.
Mr. WooD. Will you have a seat. TESTIMONY OF MARY VIRGINIA FARMER, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS In view of the fact that this witness, Miss Farmer, has registered her objection to being televised while she is testifying before this committee, the injunction heretofore made with reference to other witnesses who have evidenced a like desire is invoked with reference to her.  1737 Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
