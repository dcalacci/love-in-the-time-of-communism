Mr. SANFORD. The name John Sanford is a professional name, but since 1942 it has been my legal name. The name under which I was born was Julian Shapiro; J-u-l-i-a-n S-h-a-p-i-r-o.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you known as Jack Shapiro?
Mr. SANFORD. Well, a few people call me by the name of Jack. Not many.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Sanford?
Mr. SANFORD. I was born in New York City on May 31, 1904.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation?
Mr. SANFORD. At the present time I am a novelist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you reside?
Mr. SANFORD. Where do I reside?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; in What community ?
Mr. SANFORD. In Encino. Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California ?
Mr. SANFORD. Fifteen years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to that time, where did you live?
Mrs SANFORD. In New York City.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee briefly what your educational background has been.
Mr. SANFORD. I went to the public and high schools of New York City, and thereafter I attended Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Northwestern University, and Fordham University.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you then known by the name of Shapiro at that time ?
Mr. SANFORD. Julian Shapiro.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Shapiro, will youMr. SANFORD. NO, my name-excuse me, Mr. Tavenner. My name is Sanford.
Mr. TAVENNER. Sanford now. Excuse me. Mr. Sanford, will you tell the committee what your record of employment has been since you came to California.
Mr. SANFORD. Well, I came to California at the behest of Para- mount Pictures in 1936. I worked for 1 year as a screen writer for Paramount. Thereafter my only other connection with moving pictures has been a 6-month term at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1941. That is the only connection-those are the only connections that I have had with motion pictures. I have not been associated with them since 1941. I have practiced my own profession as a novelist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, during the period of time when you were associated with the moving-picture industry, you should have had knowledge of the existence in Hollywood of an effort to infiltrate the Communist Party, if such existed, and the committee, as you know, is conducting an investigation into those matters, endeavoring to ascertain the extent of infiltration, the purposes of the Communist Party in the organizing of the motion-picture industry, and how it proposed to and how it has .carried out its projects here. The committee would like for you to tell it all you know regarding the infiltration of communism in Hollywood.
Mr. SANFORD. Under the fifth amendment of the Constitution, no man is compelled to give evidence against himself. I therefore decline to answer the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party I 1682 
Mr. SANFORD. I decline to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. No questions. 
Mr. WooD. Any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance on this committee ?
Mr, TAVENNER. NO, sir.
Mr. WOOD. So ordered. The committee will stand in recess for 15 minutes. (A short recess was taken.)
Mr. WOOD. The committee will come to order, please. May I have the attention of the audience. We have been operating here under rather difficult conditions, acoustically speaking, and the room is a little difficult because of the ventilation. It becomes rather unpleasant for members of the committee, as well as the staff and the witnesses. I am going to ask the marshal to eliminate standing in the room, and particularly sitting in the windows from which the only air we can get must come. Please do not block the windows.
Mr. Counsel, who will you have ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to call Mr. David Raksin.
Mr. WOOD. Are you Mr. Raksin ? 
Mr. RAKSIN. I am.
Mr. WooD. You do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give this subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. RAKSIN. I do. TESTIMONY OF DAVID RAKSIN
