Mr. KESTENBAUM. New York City, 1914.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you now reside in Los Angeles? 3734 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. KESTENBAUM. Yes; I do.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived here?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. Since approximately 1946 or 1947.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation or profession?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I am a blacklisted musician.
Mr. TAVENNER. By any chance, are you also a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I don't think you have the right to pry into my private beliefs. Your purposes hereMr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to respond to the question, or, by giving, if he wishes, the legal reasons for declining to answer. I urge the witness to do that.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. The first amendment guarantees me the right to my political beliefs, my beliefs to associate, my beliefs to worship as I please. That is an immoral question, and Mr. Tavenner knows it so. (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question. I might state that the committee does not accept his answer.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer, and may I explain, it is for your own protection that you are directed to answer. And it is called to your attention that by your refusal to answer without good cause and good faith, claiming to protection of the Constitution as a reason for not answering, you might place yourself in danger of being subject to prosecution for contempt.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I answer under the rights guaranteed to me by the Bill of Rights, the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you decline to answer, claiming that protection and for the reason that you claim theMr. KESTENBAUM. The rights guaranteed to me.
Mr. JACKSON. Specifically the first and fifth amendments?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. And the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you aware of the existence of an organized group of the Communist Party in Los Angeles composed principally of members of the musicians' profession?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. We heard testimony this morning that the chief objective of the organized group of the Communist Party, to which I have referred, in 1947 and 1948 was to support the Independent Progressive Party of California. Do you have any knowledge of the Communist Party decision to act in that field?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. When you have the right to go into the voting booth with me, then I will discuss my political opinions.
Mr. MOULDER. That was not the question. The answer is purely argumentative, and I urge the witness either to answer the question or decline to answer under the provisions of the Constitution.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. Mr. Tavenner knows he has no right to ask me that question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witnness is directed to answer.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer on the grounds stated, the first and fifth amendment. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3735 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you, pursuant to Communist Party directive, register as a member of the Independent Progressive Party of California on the 23d day of February 1948?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. IS it subversive to register with a political party,
Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. MOULDER. Did you so register ?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I didn't say so. I am just asking him a question, if that is an act of subversion.
Mr. MOULDER. Then you probably will decide that question by declining to answer for the reason of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. KESTENBAJu. I asked Mr. Tavenner a question: If it is subversive to register with a political party.
Mr. SCHrER. You have no right to ask counsel questions. If you don't want to answer questions invoke your privilege. You are here to answer.
Mr. DOYLE. May I undertake briefly to answer the witness' question. It certainly is not subversive or un-American to register with any legal political party in California. But we have plenty of evidence given under oath, by the witness this morning and many times in other hearings in California by admitted Communist Party leaders, and admitted Independent Progressive Party leaders in California, that the Communist Party in California was the initiator and prime mover in the formation of the IPP in California in 1947 and 1948. This question is for the purpose of trying to learn the extent to which the Communist Party organized the IPP as a Communist front in California. For instance, Mr. Waddilove, a member of your profession, stated this morning that the formation of a Communist front was actually what the IPP was. That is why Mr. Tavenner asked you that question.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I see. The subversive list is so big that I can't keep up with all the subversive organizations. Is the IPP considered subversive?
Mr. DOYLE. We are investigating to discover the extent to which it was made subversive by theMr. KESTENBAUM. Is it now considered a subversive organization ?
Mr. DovLE. By the infiltration and control of the Communist Party.
Mr. KEsTENBAUM. Is it now considered a subversive organization?
Mr. JACKSON. According to the testimony of many witnesses, yes.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. According to testimony.
Mr. JACKSON. According to the sworn testimony of those who chose to give information in their possession to the committee, that is the fact.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. Please repeat the last question.
Mr. TAVENNER. The question was whether or not, at the instance of the Communist Party, you registered as a member of the Independent Progressive Party of California on the 23d day of February 1948. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that question on the basis of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth. 3736 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of an affidavit of registration bearing the name of Milton Kestenbaum, and ask you whether or not the name appearing thereon is your signature? The document is marked "Kestenbaum Exhibit No. 1" for identification. (Document handed to the witness and his counsel.)
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that question on the basis of the first and fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to introduce the document in evidence, and ask it be marked "Kestenbaum Exhibit No. 1." (This exhibit is similar to "Waddilove Exhibit No. 1," p. 3664, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. MOULDER. It is so ordered.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you, at the instance of the Communist Party, participate in a plan to circulate petitions for the purpose of getting the Independent Progressive Party on the ballot in 1948 ?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. The same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a petition at the end of which appears an affidavit over the name of Milton Kestenbaum. I ask you to examine the petition and state whether or not the name appearing in the affidavit is yours or was signed by you. The document is marked "Kestenbaum Exhibit No. 2" for identification. (Document handed to the witness and his counsel.)
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that question on the basis of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Kestenbaum Exhibit No. 2." (This exhibit is similar to "Waddilove Exhibit No. 3," p. 3667, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. MOULDER. It is ordered that the exhibit be so marked and admitted in evidence as requested by counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party on the date of the affidavit which you have in your hand?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that question on the basis of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you photostatic copies of application cards for membership in the Wilshire Club of the Independent Progressive Party bearing the dates February 15, 1953, and March 21, 1954, respectively, and ask you whether they were your membership cards for those years? I will mark them "Kestenbaum Exhibits Nos. 3 and 4," respectively, for identification, and to be retained in the committee's files. (Documents handed to the witness and his counsel.) 
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that question on the basis of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. MOULDER. May I at this point make a comment. A moment ago you inquired whether or not it was subversive or un-American to belong to a political party. Of course, we all concur that it is not. It is a fundamental part of our democratic process in this country to be actively a member of legitimate political parties. Then you inquired as to whether or not the IPP was cited as subversive. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3737 I am just curious to know why you refuse to answer that question if the IPP is not, in your own mind, considered to be un-American and subversive.
Mr. KESTENBAUM. Well, if I may, I will answer it this way: That the founders of our Constitution recognized, because of the nature of our Government, that perhaps at some future time certain opinions would be considered unpopular, minority opinions. And just because a person doesn't conform to the majority opinion that doesn't necessarily mean that he is subversive. Perhaps 30 years ago a person before such a committee wouldn't admit to being a member of a trade union, because if he admitted being a member of a trade union he would be blacklisted like I am today. And for this reason I inquired. I want to know what is the purpose of these questions. And that is why I answer on my rights guaranteed me under the fifth amendment.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist Party at this time?
Mr. KESTENBAUM. I refuse to answer that under the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Sidney Greene.
Mr. MOULDER. You are Mr. Sidney Greene ?
Mr. GREENE. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. GREENE. I do. TESTIMONY OF SIDNEY GREENE, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, MORTIMER VOGEL
