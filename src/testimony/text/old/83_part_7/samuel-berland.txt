Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been a resident of Los Angeles?
Mr. BERLAND. Since 1946. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And had you lived in this area at any time prior to 1946?
Mr. BERLAND. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been.
Mr. BERLAND. High school graduate.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation ?
Mr. BERLAND. I am a builder and developer.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that another way of saying contractor? What is the distinction between a contractor and a builder ?
Mr. BERLAND. I don't have a contractor's license. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by builder and developer ?
Mr. BERLAND. Let me say I am associated in the building and landdevelopment business. I may associate with people who have contractors' licenses.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged in that business?
Mr. BERLAND. Since 1950.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your employment has been in Los Angeles since 1946 when you first arrived here?
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer because it may tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. In what business were you engaged before 1950 ?
Mr. BERLAND. I must decline to answer that again for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was your business prior to 1950 that of a developer and builder of real estate? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BERLAND. Just a minute. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer. I decline to answer for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. How were you employed in 1948 ?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you live in 1948 ?
Mr. BERLAND. Same answer. I decline, I respectfully decline to answer because that answer may tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. In 1948 were you an international representative of the United Public Workers of America, CIO ?
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer that question, gentlemen, because of the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. How could it be incriminating to tell this committee whether or not you were an international representative of the United Public Workers of America at that time ?
Mr. BERLAND. Same answer.
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer because it may tend to incriminate me. 3720 COI5UNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. MOULDER. The reason for directing you to answer is not to threaten you, but purely to remind you of the dangers that may be involved in connection with contempt proceedings as a result of your refusal to answer.
Mr. BERLAND. Thank you, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you reside at 12050 Clover Avenue, Los Angeles, in February of 1948 ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BERLAND. I decline to answer for the same reasons.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, I move you instruct the witness to answer. Certainly the fact where he lived in that year could not possibly incriminate him.
Mr. MOULDER. On the request of Mr. Doyle, and without objection on the part of any other members of the committee, the witness is so directed to answer the question. (Representative Donald L. Jackson entered the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, gentlemen.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you aware of the existence of an organized group of the Communist Party in 1948 known as the Heywood, H-e-yw-o-o-d, Section, Southern Division, of the Los Angeles County Communist Party ?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1948?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been a member of the Communist Party since 1950, the time when you say you began work in the builder and developer business in Los Angeles?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, gentlemen.
Mr. TAVENNER. In 1948 were you aware of an effort being made by the Communist Party to do organizational work within the Independent Progressive Party in California ?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is a fact, is it not, that you were a member of the State Central Committee of the Independent Progressive Party at one time?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the course of the committee's investigation we obtained a photostatic copy of a letter bearing date 28th day of July, 1948, addressed to the Secretary of State of the State of California, showing that you had been appointed a delegate from Los Angeles County, the 61st Assembly District, to a State convention of the Independent Progressive Party in California. Will you examine it and state whether or not you were such a delegate from the 61st Assembly District. (Document handed to witness and his counsel.)
Mr. BERLAND (after examining document). I respectfully decline to answer for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to introduce this letter in evidence and ask that it be marked "Berland Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. MOULDER.

Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer for the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Berland Exhibit No. 2."
Mr. MOULDER. Is your reason for declining to answer the question based upon the fifth amendment, in that your answer might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. BERLAND. That is right.
Mr. MoULDER. Without objection, the exhibit offered by counsel is admitted in evidence.

Mr. TAVENNER. Were you aware in 1948 of the plan of the Communist Party to secure registration of its members in the Independent Progressive Party in California?
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you so register on the 27th day of February 1948, as indicated by this photostatic copy of an affidavit of registration, which I hand you. It is marked for identification as "Berland Exhibit No. 3." (Document handed to the witness.)
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Berland Exhibit No. 3."
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (This exhibit is similar to Waddilove exhibit No. 1, p. 3664, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you not active in the area of Los Angeles in 1948 and up through 1950 at least in the work of the Independent Progressive Party?
Mr. BERLAND. I decline to answer for the same reason, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have before me various issues of the Daily People's World. Here is one of January 30, 1950, showing that Samuel J. Berland, international representative of the CIO, United Public Workers, was to make a general report at a meeting to be held on February 7, 1950. Were you solicited by the Communist Party to engage in that type of activity?
Mr. BERLAND. I am sorry, sir; I didn't understand the question. I remember you started to read something, and thenMr. TAVENNER. I say I have before me an issue of the Daily People's World showing that you were to participate by making a general report on the Independent Progressive Party's campaign in the 16th Congressional District. Were you solicited to do that work by the Communist Party ?
Mr. MOULDER. May I suggest that he first be asked whether or not he did that work, and then ask whether or not he was solicited by the Communist Party to do it.
Mr. BERLAND. One answer at a time. I will decline to answer the first for the same reason. And I will decline to answer the second question for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then your answer is the same. 77436-56-pt. 7--6 3724 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA In other words, Mr. Berland, you refuse to tell this committee what your position in the Independent Progressive Party was, or any connection that the Communist Party may have had with your work in that group. Do I understand that?
Mr. BERLAND. I am sorry. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I will withdraw the question rather than repeat it. I have before me a photostatic copy of the July 21, 1950, issue of the Daily People's World which shows that Sam Berland, United Public Workers International representative, was one of those seeking the signing of the Stockholm Peace Appeal petitions in the area of Los Angeles. Do you recall engaging in work of that character?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, gentlemen; declination for the same reason. 
Mr. TAVENNER. According to an issue of the Daily People's World under date of March 29, 1949, it is stated that Sam Berland will chair a meeting being sponsored by the Independent Progressive Party's Ven-Mar Club. Do you recall whether or not you did act as chairman of such meeting ?
Mr. BERLAND. I decline to answer for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with a person by the name of Sylvia Lardner?
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer that question for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS Sylvia Lardner now one of the partners with you in the builder and developer business which you have described?
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Carter Darnell?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. IS Carter Darnell a partner of yours in the builder and developer business in the city of Los Angeles?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Not in the city of Los Angeles, but at Garden Grove.
Mr. BERLAND. Still the same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name of the partnership under which you and others are operating at the present time in that business?
Mr. BERLAND. Will you repeat that question, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name of the partnership in which you are engaged in the builder and developer business?
Mr. MOULDER. The business name under which he operates?
Mr. TAVENNER. That is right. 
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer that question on the same grounds. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. In the practice of your business as a builder and developer is it customary for you to procure from the Veterans' Administration certificates of reasonable value of properties which you are offering for sale as a basis for the borrowing of money? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire if there is a reason for this line of questioning related to the subject of the inquiry? (Whereupon, the committee and committee counsel confer.) (The witness confers with his counsel.) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3725 
Mr. BERLAND. Gentlemen, upon advice of counsel, I wish to say that I believe that this question is not pertinent, and beyond the scope of the committee.
Mr. MOULDER. We agree to that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether the person I inquired aboutSylvia Lardner-is now the wife of Carter Darnell? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer that question for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been a member of the Communist Party? I have asked you that question as to certain specific dates, but I am asking you now whether at any time you have been a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. BERLAND. I respectfully decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist Party now ?
Mr. BERLAND. The same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Doyle, do you have any questions to ask this witness?
Mr. DOYLE. I wish to make this statement. I have often stated it. I can understand how many patriotic Americans would join the Communist Party in our country prior to May 1945, which was the year, I believe, that Earl Browder was expelled from leadership in the American Communist Party. But, for the life of me, I have never yet been able to understand how successful American businessmen could fail to have had their eyes opened within a year or two after May 1945, as to the real objectives of the Soviet conspiracy.
Mr. BERIAND. The record will show I never admitted any membership.
Mr. DOYLE. I am not inferring that you did admit anything. I am just saying that, as one American citizen to you, sir, because I do know that your business operations are very successful dollarwise and you are in a position to do great service to your country which has blessed your financial welfare. I hope you will distribute some of that blessing in vigorous, patriotic endeavor to other people.
Mr. BERLAND. That I will do. That I will surely do. Am I excused, sir?
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions? Do you have any questions, Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. I yield to Mr. Scherer.
Mr. SCHERER. I just want to make this observation: Here we have a witness who has invoked the fifth amendment to almost every pertinent question asked. Yet he has done so without rancor and without malice, and he has done so respectfully in a dignified manner. And, also, counsel, I think, has acted in a professional and dignified manner in this instance. And it clearly demonstrates how quickly you can dispose of a witness when he follows the law.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you have any further comment to make?
Mr. BERLAND. No. 3726 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. JACKSON. I should like to associate myself with the gentleman from Ohio with respect to the manner of representation of the present witness.
Mr. COOPER. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Mr. MOULDER. However, we do not agree with the lack of information.
Mr. JACKSON. Yes; I could almost have a friendly feeling toward the witness.
Mr. MoULDER. The witness is excused:
Mr. TAVENNER. Sylvia Lardner.
Mr. MOULDER. Will you be sworn as a witness? Do you solemnly swear the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
