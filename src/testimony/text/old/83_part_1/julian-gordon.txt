Mr. GORDON. Julian Gordon.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented or accompanied here by counsel?
Mr. GORDON. No; I am not.
Mr. TAVENNER. It has been the practice of the committee to permit a witness to consult with counsel at any time he may desire during the course of his testimony, and whether or not counsel is with you or not, you still have that right.
Mr. GORDON. I have no counsel. 328 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Gordon?
Mr. GORDON. I was born in Boston in April of 1909.
Mr. TAVENNER. What has your previous educational training been, that is, your formal educational training.
Mr. GORDON. I graduated at Harvard in the class of 1930, and then went abroad for graduate study at Cambridge University in England.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you attend school in England.
Mr. GORDON. In 1931.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present occupation ?
Mr. GORDON. I make the stock and advertising accessories for an independent small motion-picture producer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you outline briefly for the committee what your employment has been since the completion of your formal education?
Mr. GORDON. After I finished at Cambridge University I went to the Bank for International Settlements at Balk, Switzerland, the World Bank, where I was to work with Leon Frazier, the head of the bank. This was soon after President Hoover declared the moratorium on the payment of war reparations on Germany of the Allied Powers. There was very little to do at the bank and I soon left, coming to this country. I worked at the newspapers in Los Angeles, the Examiner, the Times, and then for the Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles. I became ill for a year or so, and after that did some teaching in private schools.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you begin in that work ?
Mr. GORDON. I taught for a year in a preparatory school in 1940 and 1941. Soon after 1941 I went to work for the Technicolor Laboratory as a technician for several years. In 1947 1 went to France for a year.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you work in Technicolor Laboratories, specifically between what dates, that is, approximate dates?
Mr. GORDON. From 1941 to 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then I understand you went to France ?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your employment there?
Mr. GORDOo. I worked as a technician on a motion picture.
Mr. TAVENNER. For whom did you work ?
Mr. GORDON. For the Bunin organization that made Alice in Wonderland.

Mr. IGORDON.I taught for a brief while at a boys' military school, and then taught for a couple of years at the Berlitz School of Laniuages. IMr. TA\ E1NXER. Mr. Gordon, the committee has information through sworn testimony indicating you have been a member of the Communist Party, and it also has information indicating that you left the Communist Party approximately in 1947. It is my desire to ask you questions relating to your experiences in the Communist Party and your knowledge of it, if you were a member, and I call upon you to cooperate with the committee in answering these questions. First of all, I would like to call to your attention that by a sworn statement made by Mr. Lou Rosser, who had stated that he himself had been a member of the Communist Party, you were identified as having been a member of the Communist Party. Mr. Max Silver, a former high functionary of the Communist Party in Los Angeles County, testified before this committee on January 24, 1952, in executive session, and when he was asked to identify persons known to him to have been members of the Communist Party, he responded in this fashion: Julian Gordon, the husband of Emily Gordon, a teacher, and later was employed in the movie industry in Technicolor as a technician, was involved in the Hollywood strike and was a victim of that strike He lost his opportunity to work either in the Industry or at his teaching profession. Later went to Paris with some group to make a movie I don't know which one it was. I would like to ask you first whether the identification of you by
Mr. Rosser as having been a member of the Communist Party, or the identification by Mr. Max Silver are correct, or whether either is in error or false in any particular. (Representative Donald L. Jackson reentered the hearing room at this point, 10:23 a. m.)
Mr. GORDON. That identification is correct.
Mr. TAVENNE R. When did you become a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. GORDOx. In 1939; September.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under which vou became a member?
Mr. GORDON. I thought it was the best way to end war and poverty. I remained a member, as your information tells you, until, say, 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under which you left the party
Mr. GORDON. I lost my belief.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, will you elaborate on that? What do you mean by saying that you lost your belief?
Mr. GORDON. It struck me there were other forces that were more important.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well now, I aim sorry, but I do not quite understand what you mean. You say that you lost your behefs. What beliefs were you referring to?
Mr. GORDON. That this was the way to achieve the purposes for which I originally joined the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was it that caiied vou to lose those beliefs? Did you have any experiences Well, may I put the question this ay l) 330 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA within the party which stand out in your memory as being milestones in your decision to renounce the party or to get out of it, that is, the Communist Party ?
Mr. GORDON. Perhaps I should tell you a little of my party history.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; I would certainly want to know that.
Mr. GoRDON. In 1944 I helped to form the Hollywood Communist Club. I became the president of that club.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of the club?
Mr. GORDON. The Hollywood Communist Club. I helped to form that club. I was its president for a year and a half until the club was broken up. It was shortly thereafter, with the end of the war, that I left the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the cause of that party breaking up?
Mr. GORDON. The policy of the party had changed. That was basically the reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well. in what respect had it changed ?
Mr. GORDON. There were no longer to he community clubs, but smaller groups, principally for the protection of the membership.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, the mere changing of the number of persons in a group couldn't have been such an important change in policy to have affected the existence of the club, could it?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. Instead of meeting in a large open hall, they then in smaller groups met in homes.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, the party was going underground at that time; is that in substance what you mean?
Mr. GORDON. The belief was that the membership would be better protected and would not be so open to exposure if they did not meet in large open public halls.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that change in policy led to the end of the Communist group that you were a member of? Is that what you mean?
Mr. GORDON. Led to the end of the Hollywood Communist Club.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, then, the dissolution of that club was nothing more than a practical realinement of the organizational structure of the party; there was nothing basically different in the operation of the party after that than there was before, other than that for security reasons you were to meet in small groups.
Mr. GORDON. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, what I am getting at is this: I wanted to know basically what the reason is for your decision to terminate your relationship with the Communist Party, and you started, I thought, to tell me that by relating your experience in the party, but I do not believe that what you just told me is responsive to that inquiry. However, if there is anything else you desire to say about that, why, 1 do not want to cut you off. My inquiry at the moment is to find out what occurred to cause you to lose the beliefs which you said you formerly had; and, if there was an experience that you had in the Communist Party that would be helpful to this committee in understanding why you left the party, we would like to know it. Possibly I can refresh your recollection as to one instance.
Mr. GORDON. The basic reason was the release of atomic energy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, will you explain that, please ?
Mr. GORDON. I came to the conclusion that there was no longer any reason for the hatred between the two sides, and that I would do no COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 331 more to increase the hatred because the reason for it had disappeared with the discovery of atomic energy, that men could now produce enough for all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, let me recall to your mind an incident which was the subject of testimony on the part of Dr. Louise Light. Probably you have read this from the testimony. At the outset I want to say to you that I am not going to abuse the confidential privilege between husband and wife, but I want to refer to this incident to see whether it had any part in your decision. When Dr. Light was on the witness stand at a hearing conducted in Washington, January 21, 1952, I asked her this question: Were any directions given by the Communist Party as to preference in employment of nurses or employees, office employees of the doctors? Dr. LIGHT. Yes; I had an experience myself where I had employed a girl and she had been in my office perhaps a week and a half or so, who was previously a party member, who had dropped out of the party because of lack of interest. They came to me and told me that-they didn't ask me, they told me would I discharge this girl because of the fact that she was no longer a party person; she was under suspicion. They had no specific proof, because I knew this girl very well, and that they could supply someone in my office who would be much more suitable. Of course, I disagreed with them very strongly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the person employed by you? Dr. LIGHT. The name was Emily Gordon.
Mr. TAVENNER. Emily Gordon? Dr. LIGHT. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER You said they came to you. Dr. LIGHT Well, a committee of two of the professional sects. The one who did the talking with me was a Dr. Max Schoen, a dentist. Did that incident have any part to play in your decision or had you made your decision prior to that time ?
Mr. GORDON. My decision was made prior to that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know of any other instances in which the Communist Party organization within the professions, either medical or legal, exercised that kind of dictation to its members; that is, determine who should be employed and who should not be?
Mr. GORDON. I am sorry, I cannot answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say you are sorry you cannot answer, you mean to indicate there were such instances but you do not desire to speak of it? Because, if it is a matter that relates to your wife, I do not want to ask you about it.
Mr. GORDON. It has nothing to do with my wife.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, do you know of any other instance when that was attempted or when it was done ?
Mr. GORDON. I am sorry; I will not answer that question.
Mr. JACKsON. May I ask upon what ground your refusal to answer that question is based ?
Mr. GORDON. The decision I arrived at 7 years ago that I would do nothing to add to the hatred between the two sides, because there is no longer any reason for that hatred, since with atomic energy men can now produce enough for all.
Mr. SCHERER. When you say "two sides," would you clarify that statement?
Mr. GORDow. The United States and the Soviet Union.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you joined the Communist Party in 1939, how many composed the cell or group to which you were assigned? Was it a large group or a small group ? 332 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. GORDON. I am sorry; I will not answer this kind of question.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many different groups of the Communist Party were you a member of between 1939 and the time you left the party?
Mr. GORDON. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your answer ?
Mr. GORDON. The same. I will not answer this kind of question.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. ChairmanMr. VELDE. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON (continuing). I ask the witness be directed to answer.
Mr. VELDE. Yes; the Chair feels that is a legitimate question. I believe that you could be of great help to this committee if you would answer these questions. Of course, I might advise you, too, that you are under oath and that you do have a right, of course, to refuse to answer questions. But, in order to make it impossible or improbable that you might possibly be cited for contempt, you must state your refusal to answer on a legal ground, a constitutional ground. With those instructions in mind, I now direct that you answer the last question that was asked of you.
Mr. GORDON. I have respect for the authority of this committee, but again I must refuse.
Mr. WALTER. May I ask a question at this point, Mr. Chairman ?
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Walter. 
Mr. WALTER. You say you left the Communist Party when the physical structure changed from large units to small units, and I believe you said the small unit system was erected for the protection of members. Will you explain what you meant by that?
Mr. GORDON. As the situation changed from the wartime cooperation with communism to the conflict with them, increased protection for the membership seemed advisable.
Mr. WALTER. Protection from what?
Mr. GORDON. Exposure.
Mr. WALTER. Exposure? Why were they fearful of exposure?
Mr. GORDON. Mostly for their jobs.
Mr. VELDE. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question there, please, following Mr. Walter's question ?
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DO LE.' Well, at this period in your experience-let's see, what year was that That was in 1944, I think you said.
Mr. GORDON. 1945, the latter part. MIr. DOYLE. You helped form the Communist Club of Hollywood in 1944?
Mr. GORDOX Yes. 
Mr DOYLE. And it dissolved in 1945 ?
Mr. GORDON. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. And when it dissolved you were still president at the time. You said you served for a year and a half, I think, until it began meeting in private homes.
Mr. GORDON. The early part of 1944 until the latter part of 1945.
Mr. DoYLE. At that time was it the practice to discharge folks because they were members of the Communist Party, if that was known? Was that your knowledge of the local situation in 1945? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 333 lr. GORDON. It was beginning to take place.
Mr. DOYLE. In the entertainment field?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. Or the field in which you were an expert' Was it beginning to be the practice in that field of activity in 1945?
Mr. GORDON. It was beginning to take place.
Mr. DOYLE. I think your exact language was, "There was belief that the members would not be so open to exposure." That is the wording I wrote down as you used it. I think you used those exact words. Well now, was the exposure you were afraid of the exposure of membership in the Communist Party, because at that time, even, it would be likely to make you lose employment or make the Communists lose employment if it was known they were Communists?
Mr. GORDON. It was felt that was likely.
Mr. DoYna. What was there about Communist Party membership in the Los Angeles area in 1945 that was so in disrepute in 1945 that made people lose their jobs, or attempt to See what I am getting at? I am not in disrespect, sir, of your considered reasons. I notice you said you have respect for the authority of this committee. I appreciate your saying that, because some people do not, even though we are a constituted committee of the United States Congress. It is rather refreshing to have a man come, without the aid of private counsel by his side, and state openly he has respect for this committee. What was there about the Communist Party membership in the Los Angeles area in 1945 that made them want to keep unknown as Communists' Let me ask you this way: Without asking you now who had been discharged, if anyone, on account of Communist Party membership in 1945, at the time you relate, had there been anyone discharged from the entertainment field because of Communist Party membership, to your knowledge? You have stated that that was1Mr.WALTER. Mr. Doyle, he has five questions before him now.
Mr. DOYLE. I am trying toMr. WALTER. I suggest he be permitted to answer them before you ask any more.
Mr. DOYLE. I am trying to stay in the field of cooperating with the witness, to give him every chance in the world to give us helpful answers, if he will.
Mr. GORDON. To the best of my memory, that was the case.
Mr. DOYLE. There had been someone discharged?
Mr. GORDON. Yes; there was a feeling this would take place.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask one more question ?
Mr. VELDE. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. I had one more question. You volunteered this statement, sir, as I recall it, "Perhaps my party history will help answer that question." Then you volunteered the statement in 1945 you helped form the Hollywood Communist Club. As I recall it, you volunteered one statement that "Perhaps my party history will help." Do you remember that ?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. Well now, what other party history, Communist Party history have you in mind that you would relate? You related you 334 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA formed that club. What else did you do in the Communist Party, as part of your Communist Party history, about which you volunteered this statement?
Mr. GORDON. The thing I said, what I said was the major things in my party history, and I want to put it on the record.
Mr. DOYLE. That is all.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were a member of the Communist Party at the time that the Duclos letter was received in 1945 which caused a reorganization of the Communist Party, were you not ?
Mr. GORDON. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did the receipt of that letter play any part in your ultimate decision to leave the Communist Party'
Mr. GORDON. No; it did not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of what group were you a member, what was the name of the group of which you were a member at the time of the receipt of the Duclos letter
Mr. GorDON. I am sorry. I cannot answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I think I will have to ask that he be directed to answer the question.
Mr. VELDE. First of all, did you say you cannot, or you refuse to answer the question, Mr. Gordon ?
Mr. GORDON. I refuse to answer the question, Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. Then the chair feels it is a perfectly proper question which could be answered without any fear of self-incrimination or otherwise, and I do direct you to answer the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you subpenaed to appear as a witness?
Mr. VELDE. Just a minute. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Excuse me.
Mr. VELDE. Will the witness abide by the Chair's direction ?
Mr. GORDON. I am sorry.
Mr. JACKSON. You persist in the refusal to answer ?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. Is the witness here under compulsion of a subpena?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, Mr. Chaiman. I have the subpena before me, and I would like to offer it in evidence as Gordon Exhibit No. 1.
Mr. VELDE. It will be received. (The document referred to was received in evidence and marked "Gordon Exhibit No. 1.")
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Clardy?
Mr. CLARDY. No questions.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Scherer.
Mr. Moulder ?
Mr. MOULDER. Just one question, Mr. Chairman. In what year did you say you disassociated yourself of active affiliation with the Communist Party ?
Mr. GORDON. At the end of 1945.
Mr. MOULDER. Since that time have you in any way been affiliated with the Communist Party activity?
Mr. GORDON. No; I have not.
Mr. MoULDER. Then you are not now a member of the Communist Party? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 335 
Mr. GORDON. NO. 
Mr. MOULDER. I would be interested m knowing just what your belief is. Do you still believe in the philosophy or the policy of the Communist Party or the philosophy of government that they believe in? 
Mr. GORDON. At the moment, sir, I know only one truth.
Mr. MOULDER. The point I am trying to make is even if you were not actively a member or attending meetings of the Communist Party, are you, in fact, still a Communist at heart and in belief and sympathy for the party ? I have only one belief now.
Mr. GORDONS.
Mr MOULDER. You haven't answered my question. My question, what you believe in, as far as the Communist Party is concerned. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. GoRIN. I believeMr VELDE. Proceed.
Mr GORDON. I believe there is only one truth; that God is an active moral force. That is the only truth. Everything else is colored by self-interest; that both sides can agree on this truth.
Mr. MOrLDER. In the event of a conflict between this country and Communist Russia, which side would you believe would be holding to the truth or would be just, according to your philosophy?
Mr. GORDON. I have seen both sides, and both are based on good.
Mr. MOULDER. That is all.
Mr. VELDE. That is not an answer to the question Mr. Moulder put to you. Can you give us an answer which side you think has right and truth, in the event of a conflict between those two? That can be answered very simply. The committee would appreciate it very much if you would answer the question.
Mr. GORDON. In the event of a war ?
Mr. VELDE. Yes.
Mr. GORDON. Between the two countries? I would fight for the United States.
Mr. JACKSON. ~WiT, if I may ask?
Mr. GORDON. For the same reason that you would.
Mr. JACKSON. I would fight for the United States for a number of reasons, including the fact that the Soviet Union has given every evidence of attempting to destroy all of the concepts of divine philosophy and spiritual and moral ethics. Does that enter into is that your concept of why you would fight for the United States, or one of the reasons ? them. repeat
Mr. GORDON. I have stated my beliefs. All I can do is
Mr. JACKSON. I would say to you, sir, that in a day when men of God, ministers of the cloth, are rotting in Communist prisons throughout the world, it should not be difficult for one who bases his life on moral and spiritual ethics to make a decision in that regard.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions.
Mr. VELDE. Is there any reason, Mr. Counsel, why this witness should not be dismissed?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. VELDE. What is the date of service of the subpoena ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Beale has it.
Mr. BEALE. February 4, 1953. 336 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES
