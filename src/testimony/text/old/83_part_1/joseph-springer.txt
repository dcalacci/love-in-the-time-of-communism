Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. MOULDER. Are you represented here by counsel?
Mr. SPRINGER. Yes, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. Will counsel identify himself? 
Mr.
Mr. fectly Are ESTERMAN. William B. Esterman. DoYLE. Hadn't you better make sure that the witness is percomfortable now and his eyes are not bothered in any way? you comfortable ? 
Mr. SPRINGER. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. Where do you reside, Mr. Springer? 
Mr. SPRINGER. I reside in Los Angeles.
Mr. MOULDER. Can you give us your exact address?
Mr. SPRINGER. 4237 Drucker, D-r-u-c-k-e-r, Street, zone 32, Los Angeles.
Mr. MOULDER. Where were you born ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I was born in Poland.
Mr. MOULDER. In what year? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 399 
Mr. SPRINGER. 1910. 
Mr. MOULDER. Are you a citizen of the United States?
Mr. SPRINGER. Yes, sir. 
Mr. MOULDER. How did you become a citizen?
Mr. SPRINGER. I came here as a minor; my father took out his papers in 1928.
Mr. MOULDER. The chairman in his statement referred to a camp. What is the name of the camp of which you and your wife are the proprietor and owner?
Mr. SPRINGER. My wife and I run the camp of Camp Tenaya, T-e-n-a-y-a, and we took that name from a lake in Yosemite.
Mr. MOULDER. Where is that camp located?
Mr. SPRINGER. Crestline, Calif. 
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, I really can't hear the questions or the answers. I wonder if the loudspeaking equipment is working again in this room.
Mr. MOULDER. What kind of camp is it, Mr. Springer?
Mr. SPRINGER. A children's camp run during the summer vacation when children get off from school.
Mr. MOULDER. And for what period of time during the summer?
Mr. SPRINGER. From June up to September. 
Mr. MOULDER. You don't operate the camp in that respect during the wintertime.
Mr. SPRINGER. No. 
Mr. MOULDER. During this last year, during the months of, particularly the date of December 5 through to December 7 of 1952 of last year, were you then operating the camp? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. During the off season, so to speak, after the camp closes we usually rent it out to various organizations or groups of families that want to rent the camp in order to defray some of the expenses that are incurred.
Mr. MOULDER. On those dates, December 5, 6, and 7, were you then here in Los Angeles or were you at the camp?
Mr. ESTERMAN. What year?
Mr. MOULDER. 1952. 
Mr. SPRINGER. I don't recall the exact dates. However, we have rented that camp during the month of December or November. I don't recall the exact date.
Mr. MOULDER. Of last year?
Mr. SPRINGER. Last year; yes.
Mr. MOULDER. Now, were you there at any time during the month of December of last year ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I would like to consult with my attorney, if you don't mind.
Mr. VELDE. You may consult your attorney. (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.) 
Mr. ESTERMAN. Thank you very much. I was asking if that was amusing, because some of the audience seems to think so.
Mr. VELDE. I am sorry. Let us have order in the audience so the witness can have full advantage of conferring with his counsel.
Mr. SPRINGER. In view of the statement which was read here by the chairman of this committee at the outset, I would decline to an- 400 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA swer this question, because it would mean to testify against myself and, therefore, I claim the protection of the fifth amendment.
Mr. MoULDER. It is in view of the statement made by the chairman that information has come to this committee, and an opportunity is now being given to you to clarify and to testify concerning the facts or to deny them and clear yourself, and we are just trying to find out from you whether or not this information is true. You are now being given the opportunity to tell us whether or not it is true. (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Congressman, you have asked not 1 question, but you have asked 3 in 1.
Mr. MOULDER. I just asked you if you were at your camp during the month of December. It is a very simple question. You often go there, do you not?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think that I have made my answer very clear, just a while ago when I referred to the remarks made by the chairman at the outset of this meeting-of this hearing.
Mr. MOULDER. Well, were you there, then, during the month of November of 1952?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think that this is the same question, and I can only give you the same answer.
Mr. MOULDER. Did you operate the camp last summer?
Mr. SPRINGER. I did. 
Mr. MOULDER. You did and your wife, also?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. MOULDER. And now you don't want to tell us whether or not you were back there in the month of December 1952? Is that the way I understand your testimony? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have answered that question before.
Mr. MOULDER. Now, isn't it true, or is it a fact that during December, on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, at Camp Tenaya, at about midnight, approximately 20 people traveled there by automobiles and held a meeting at that camp, and you were present at that time? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. ESTERMAN. Can we have an agreement if he says it is the same thing, that that applies to his reference to the fifth amendment.
Mr. VELDE. Yes. Let it be understood if the witness declines to answer "for the same reasons," those reasons are because of the fifth amendment to the Constitution, which provide against self-incrimination. (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have answered this question previously, and I give you the same answer to this question.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you know whether or not those people were there at the camp during the month of December, on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of last year?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have answered that before.
Mr. MOULDER. Isn't it true that they were all leaders of the Communist Party of this area?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is the same question again and the same answer I can give you.
Mr. VELDE. That is, you decline to answer?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 401 
Mr. JACKSON. For the same reasons?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. MOULDER. Now, are you acquainted with a man by the name of Max Klansky?
Mr. SPRINGER. I don't think that you can ask me a question of that sort.
Mr. MOULDER. Well, I asked it and all you have to do is answer it.
Mr. SPRINGER. I understand you asked it, but I am standing on my constitutional ground and I give you the same answer to the same questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Was he present there at that meeting ? 
Mr. SPRINGER. Same question again and the same answer.
Mr. JACKSON. For the same reason?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. VELDE. In other words, you decline to answer the question for the same reasons you declined to answer other questions?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. MOULDER. For the reason you feel it might tend to incriminate you? Now, is it true or not that Max Klansky is known to you personally and intimately as one of the organizers of the Juarez division of the Communist Party?
Mr. SPRINGER. Same question and I can give you the same answer.
Mr. SCHERER. It isn't the same question. It is a different question.
Mr. VELDE. I agree with the gentleman from Ohio. Do you decline to answer the question ? 
Mr. ESTERMAN. Can we consult for a moment? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. ESTERMAN. He says he wants an understanding. He says he declines to answer for the same reasons he gave before, or will he need to repeat them? Will it be understood if he says he declines to answer the questions for the same reasons he gave before, that it will be understood he is incorporating them by reference without having to give them again.
Mr. VELDE. That is right. 
Mr. DOYLE. Counsel, the chairman stipulated that with the committee, stipulated with you and the witness before. The chairman had the authority to stipulate that would be the fact. You don't need to ask it again.
Mr. ESTERMAN. No.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you know the purpose for which this meeting was held there at your camp ? 
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer for the same reasons I have given before.
Mr. MoULDER. Don't you know it is a fact that at that meeting Max Klansky made a speech and you were present there with your wife and he advised all those present, because of security reasons, not to walk around in the daytime and to stay in their cottages so they wouldn't be seen by anyone else in that area?
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer for the same reasons I have given previously.
Mr. MOULDER. Isn't it true you took notes at that meeting and made a record of what was stated and said and how you were instructed by Max Klansky at the meeting? 402 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer on the same grounds I stated before. 
Mr. MOULDER. And that this meeting was composed of the top functionaries and the leaders of the Communist Party of this area? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. ESTERMAN. May I ask a question?
Mr. VELDE. Yes.
Mr. MoULDER. And I understand you decline to answer because of the same reasons previously given ?
Mr. ESTERMAN. I didn't understand the question. When you say "and," do you mean that previous questions have been answered- 
Mr. MOULDER. Yes.
Mr. ESTERMAN. That is not a fact.
Mr. MOULDER. I am just asking you if those statements which I have stated are true or false. Now, you decline to answer-that is what I understand-for the reasons previously given?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. MOULDER. Isn't it true that Max Klansky, in his opening remarks at this meeting, referred to the meeting as one of the historic meetings of the Communist Party in this area and one of the series of the new schools being held by the Communist Party in California ? Is it true or not that he made such a statement there at that meeting?
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer on the same reasons I have given previously.
Mr. MOULDER. What was your reaction to his statement that the group had met there at your resort or your camp and that they reflected the Bolshevik devotion of the comrades, all those present, as being loyal working Communists?
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer on the same reasons I have given previously.
Mr. MOULDER. Was it Max Klansky who spoke at that meeting wherein he stated and delivered a lecture at this meeting on the subject of how the Communist Party members there present were to recruit other members of the party to infiltrate into the shops and key industries and defense establishments, and particularly in the California area ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have answered it before. I will decline to answer this one on the same grounds I stated before.
Mr. MOULDER. Are you a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SPRINER. I will decline to answer this question on the same grounds I have given before.
Mr. MOULDER. Or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SPRINGER. Same question, the same answer.
Mr. MOULDER. What are you doing now?
Mr. SPRINGER. I am working.
Mr. MoULDER. What are you working at?
Mr. SPRINGER. Producing ladies' coats and suits, an operator.
Mr. DOYLE. Where is your factory located?
Mr. SPRINGER. In Los Angeles.
Mr. DOYLE. Where?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think it is a very unfair question, because it might(At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 403 
Mr. DOYLE. You don't have to answer it if you think it will incriminate you.
Mr. SPRINGER. I don't think it is pertinent to this hearing; and, therefore, I don't think I am obligated to answer a question of this sort. If you can tell me the legislative purpose of it, I might consider it.
Mr. CLARDY. May I ask a question at this juncture?
Mr. VELDE. Will you yield to- 
Mr. MOULDER. I will yield to the gentleman.
Mr. CLARDY. Have any Communist meetings been held at that location where your manufacturing operations are carried on?
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer on the same grounds I have given previously.
Mr. CLARDY. Where is that located? 
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have asked before for the legislative purpose of this question.
Mr. CLARDY. I am asking the question. Where is the shop located?
Mr. SPRINGEE. I think I have just asked you, Mr. CongressmanMr. CLARDY. I am not answering. 
Mr. VELDE. The witness is here to answer questions propounded by members of the committee and not to ask questions of the committee. So, the Chair would appreciate it very much if you would answer, or decline to answer.
Mr. ESTERMAN. May I explain ?
Mr. VELDE. Yes. 
Mr. ESTERMAN. He is asking for the legislative purpose under the case of Jones v. Securities and Exchange Commission. If the Chair will order him to answer and state if it has a legislative purpose, he will answer.
Mr. VELDE. I am sure the address of the building where he now operates is very necessary in the performance by this committee of their duties, and it will be useful to know what the address of your shop is.
Mr. MOULDER. May I proceed 
Mr. CLARDY. Let's get the answer, and I am done.
Mr. SPRINGER. 910 South Los Angeles Street.
Mr. MOULDER. Would you give us the name of your wife ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have stated that before.
Mr. MOULDER. I don't recall it.
Mr. SPRINGER. Preva Springer; P-r-e-v-a. 
Mr. MOULDER. I will yield to the gentleman from California.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Springer, have you ever rented the property known as Camp Tenaya to any person or persons known by you to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think that this question is similar to questions placed to me before, and I will refuse to answer this one on the same grounds that I have given before.
Mr. JACKSON. How many persons lectured during the period in question last December at Camp Tenaya?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is the same question, and all I can do is give you the same answer.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Counsel, do you have some questions to ask?
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no questions. 
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask some questions? 404 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Clardy.
Mr. CLARDY. I pass. 
Mr. DOYLE. I want to ask a couple of questions.
Mr. CLARDY. I know I won't get an answer; so I will give up.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. I am familiar with the Crestline area geographically, being a Los Angeles County resident and loving the mountains. How many cabins do you have in your Camp Tenaya ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I have 1 large lodge and 6 platform tents-what you call them -with wooden sidings.
Mr. DOYLE. When you say "1 large room," is that an auditorium or a little assembly room where you have music and dances and so forth?
Mr. SPRINGER. No. There is a dining area there, cooking facilities for the summertime for the children.
Mr. DOYLE. IS this a large room?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. JACKSON. It is a lodge, isn't it?
Mr. SPRINGER. Yes; a lodge. It is one huge room, and there is only one bedroom in it, and the fireplace; and it has, naturally, seating capacity around it.
Mr. DOYLE. How many years back does the ownership of you and your wife to this nice camp extend?
Mr. SPRINGER. One year.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you the sole owner, you and your wife?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Neither directly nor indirectly is there any other ownership other than you two ?
Mr. SPRINGER. No, there isn't any. As a matter of fact, we hocked our house to make a down payment on it.
Mr. DOYLE. Have you traveled to Poland or Russia since you became an American citizen ?
Mr. SPRINGER. NO.
Mr. DOYLE. Or any other foreign country?
Mr. SPRINGER. No. I might have been once down to Tijuana, maybe, for an hour or so, that is about all.
Mr. DOYLE. Have you written any books or pamphlets of any sort since you became an adult?
Mr. SPRINGER. I don't think that that is necessary for me to answer this on the ground that I have stated previously.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, whatever books, if you have written any, or pamphlets, would tend to incriminate you; is that your answer?
Mr. ESTERMAN. Excuse us.
Mr DOYLE. I haven't asked you whether you wrote any Communist' books or not.
Mr. ESTERIAN. Do you mean any kind of book?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes, is he an author for pay, or an amateur, or what, don't you see?
Mr. SPRINGER. I never wrote anything except a letter, maybe, to a friend. All I know is I am an operator at cloaks and suits, producing ladies' coats and suits, that's all.
Mr. DOYLE. I am sure that wouldn't incriminate you. This meeting that was held up there in December, I mean, you had some people up there in the month of December, didn't you? I am COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 405 not asking you who, now; I am asking if you rented any cabins in the month of December
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Chairman, I think that a similar question of this sort was asked me before. I think I have answered that question. I think it would be ridiculous on my part to say again the same thing as I said before.
Mr. VELDE. You can say it in a lot less time than you have just used making that statement.
Mr. SPRINGER. Do I have to answer this question?
Mr. VELDE. Yes, a reasonable repetition.
Mr. SPRINGER. Therefore I will answer it the same way that I have answered before. I stated previously that I cannot and will not answer a question of this sort on the grounds that I have stated previously.
Mr. DOYLE. I assume, or am I in error-I have been away from California now several years in Washington, and I may not be exactly familiar with the law involving the keeping of registers and a record of people in lodges and hotels, and facilities. (Representative Francis E. Walter entered the hearing room at this point, 2:55 p. m.)
Mr. DOYLE. Do you keep a register of people who use your rooms and assembly rooms overnight?
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Doyle, would you clarify this question for me?
Mr. DOYLE. As I recall it, Mr. Springer, there at least used to be a California hotel, lodge, and inn law which required you to register every person who comes to your camp and stays overnight. I assume that law is still on the books. Is it, do you know ?
Mr. ESTERMAN. You don't have to answer that.
Mr. DOYLE. Your counsel says you don't have to answer that. I think you are charged with knowledge of the law, however, if it is on the books. Now, I want to ask you this question: In the month of December did you keep a record of all the adults who stayed in your inn and lodge overnight at any time during the month?
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have answered previously, when the chairman stated it, I have answered the chairman before, and it is the same type of a question that was presented to me at the beginning, and, therefore, I would decline to answer this question on the same basis, on the same grounds that I have stated before.
Mr. DoYIL. In other words, you claim your constitutional privilege that it might incriminate you if you stated that you complied with the law of the State of California in keeping a register of your hotel guests. That is the effect of your answer to me, Witness.
Mr. ESTERMAN. Is that a question ?
Mr. DOYLE. It is my statement. I wanted to explain, Counsel. Now, do I understand that in view of my statement of what I am trying to get from you-I don't see how it would incriminate youI am not arguing with you, but I am just stating to you frankly that if it is the law of California, and I believe it to be, I don't see how in God's name it could incriminate you under the fifth amendment if you said that you kept a register of all your guests in the month of December 1952. Now, if you didn't keep it, and it is the law, I can't understand why you wouldn't want to say anything about it.
Mr. ESTERMAN. There is no question. 31747-53-pt. 1-10 406 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. DOYLE. I asked him if he kept a register of all his adult guests during the month of December 1952.
Mr. ESTERMAN. He answered that. Do you want him to answer it again?
Mr. DOYLE. He pleaded the fifth amendment.
Mr. ESTERMAN. There is no question pending.
Mr. DOYLE. The question still stands and his answer still stands. WVell, one more question, Mr. Chairman. Did you participate in sending out any written invitations or announcements for any adult group to come as a group to your camp in the month of December 1952? I mean through a letter or through a printing advertisement or an invitation.
Mr. SPRINGER. I think that to this question I could only give you,
Mr. Doyle, the same answer that I have given previously-Mr. DOYLE. Well, you are running a public camp, aren't youMr. ESTERMAN. Wait a minute. He hasn't finished his answer.
Mr. SPRINGER. On the same grounds of the fifth amendment that I stated previously.
Mr. DOYLE. Let me ask you this: If I misunderstand, I didn't want to misunderstand you. This is a public camp and you rent it for hire to folks who come and have the fee to pay it, don't you; that is true, isn't it?
Mr. SPRINGER. It is a children's camp mainly.
Mr. DOYLE. But you rent to whatever qualified children come. and their fees are paid?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Don't you keep their parents there with the children, ever?
Mr. SPRINGER. No.
Mr. DOYLE. You send the parents home after they bring the children ?
Mr. SPRINGER. The children come up there and the parents leave them for 2 or 3 weeks or 4 weeks, or for the entire season.
Mr. DOYLE. How do the children know the camp is there? How do you get notice to parents that your camp is open in the summer? What announcement do you make?
Mr. SPRINGER. We have a brochure, and if you are interested, Mr. Doyle, after the hearing I could give you one.
Mr. DOYLE. I would appreciate having one, of all copies of your publicity during the last year.
Mr. SPRINGER. And then there is advertisements in papers.
Mr. DOYLE. Will you furnish the committee with a copy of all your ads during the last year? No doubt you keep a scrapbook. Let us inspect them, at least.
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Doyle, I would like to accommodate you and the committee. However, my counsel advises me that if we get a formal request, and I would like my counsel to look it over, I will be glad to furnish all these things to the committee.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, I am making that request that the chairman ask that the operator of this public camp furnish the committee a copy of all the announcements made through newspapers or otherwise during the last year in order to attract public trade at his lodge, or private groups. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 407 
Mr. VELDE. Did the witness say that he would be willing to do that ?
Mr. ESTERMAN. He said he would be willing if I could see the formal request.
Mr. SPRINGER. If my counsel could see the formal request.
Mr. ESTERMAN. Give us a subpena duces tecum.
Mr. VELDE. The witness is requested to abide by the wishes of the gentleman from California, Mr. Doyle, relative to the material that he asked for.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask this closing question, perhaps, without being bound that this is my last question: Do you advertise in the People's World or the Daily Worker, two of the papers which by reputation are Communist Party papers, for your camp?
Mr. SPEINGER. I cannot answer this question for the same reasons that I have given you before under the fifth amendment.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you advertise in any of the daily papers in the Los Angeles area? Did you advertise during the last year in the Los Angeles-well, the Times, the Herald, or the Examiner; did you place ads with them advertising your camp?
Mr. SPRINGER. I advertised in the B'nai B'rith Messenger, the Valley Jewish News, and La Opinion, a Spanish-speaking paper. Those I think are the only papers.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, at this point I think it is very proper and pertinent that I give some 8 or 10 lines of Public Law 831 to this witness' knowledge, because he has asked what legislative purpose was served by certain questions asked by my colleagues and myself. In answering that question, in part, may I say for your information, Public Law 831 of the 81st Congress, chapter 1024, the second session, title I, section 2, said this-now this is a declaration by your United States Congress, Mr. Springer. [Reading:] NECESSITY FORLEGISLATION.-As a result of evidence adduced before the various committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, the Congress hereby finds that(1) There exists a world Communist movement which, in its origins, its de. velopment, and its present practice, is a worldwide revolutionary movement whose purpose it is, by treachery, deceit, infiltration into other groups (governmental and otherwise), espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means deemed necessary to establish a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in the countries throughout the world through the medium of a worldwide Communist organization. Did you ever know that the United States Congress made that declaration during the 81st Congress as a matter of national policy'?
Mr. SPRINGER. Counsel advises me that I don't have to answer this question.
Mr. DOYLE. Would it incriminate you in any way to admit whether or not you knew what bills and laws Congress has passed?
Mr. SPRINGER. I didn't say that it would incriminate me to any extent. But counsel advises me that I don't have to answer that, and I am not an attorney; therefore, if my counsel advises me, I presume that that is the proper position for me to take.
Mr. DoLE. I wish the record to show, Mr. Chairman, to my last question or statement, I am surprised to learn that any member of the American bar feels that it would incriminate any client to admit that his client knew the text of bills passed by the United States Congress.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Doyle, counsel didn't say that he believed it would incriminate him. 408 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. DOYLE. But his client pleaded the fifth amendment.
Mr. SPRINGER. I didn't. 
Mr. DOYLE. He gave the same answer that he gave before, and that involved the fifth amendment, believe it or not.
Mr. VELDE. I believe, Mr. Doyle, that the answer was that he was advised by counsel that he didn't have to answer that question.
Mr. ESTERMAN. He will be glad to answer it if you want to proceed.
Mr. VELDE. Proceed and ask him why.
Mr. DOYLE. I want to know why you refused to state if you ever heard of that act.
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Doyle, I don't usually follow all the laws that Congress passes; and, therefore, I don't know what the specific law refers to. All I know is that I go to work and I make cloaks and suits.
Mr. DOYLE. Of course, as Members of Congress, we don't claim that we know all the laws backward, but this law refers to one subject, a world Communist movement, and claims a world conspiracy. I think that is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Springer, did anyone have a joint interest or a financial interest of any character with you and your wife in the property that was used as a camp, at any time during the month of December 19521 (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. I can only give you the same answers that I have given you previously, Mr. Tavenner. I think I have made my position clear in reference to the camp, who are the owners. However, on this question, the way it is phrased I cannot answer it. I can only answer it on the previous grounds, as I said before-the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me understand your answer a little further. You testified that no one was interested or is interested in that property at the present time except you and your wife. That was your testimony originally. Now, I am merely asking you whether or not any other person had an interest with you and your wife during the month of December 1952. (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Tavenner, I think at the outset-I don't remember which gentleman here, I think Mr. Moulder, asked the question: Who are the owners of the camp? And at that time I stated
Mrs. Springer and myself are the owners of that camp, and that is since last year.
Mr. TAVENNER. And my question is, Who were the owners in December 1952?
Mr. SPRINGER. So, I just stated that since last year Mr. and Mrs. Springer are the owners of the camp.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now will you answer my question, please? Who were the owners of that camp in 1952, December 1952? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. ESTERMAN. He answered that several times.
Mr. SPRINGER. I think I have answered it.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have not answered that question at all.
Mr. CLARDY. By the word "since," do you mean during the entire year 1952?
Mr. ESTERMAN. When did you buy it! COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 409 
Mr. SPRINGER. We bought the camp last year, and it went through escrow, I believe, sometime in the month of March or April, and we are the sole owners. As a matter of fact, we are still making payments on it.
Mr. CLARDY. Since March of last year ?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then do you mean to state that no one else has had a joint interest with you in this property since March or April of 1952?
Mr. EsTERar AN. You just answered that.
Mr. SPRINGER. We are the owners, as I just stated. - It is the same thing as before. We are the owners of the camp, Camp Tenaya, since last year.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand that you are, but have you been the sole owners since March or April of 1952?
Mr. SPRINGEn. There is no partnership. Mr. Chairman, I really can't understand Mr. Tavenner's questions. I really don't know. I just stated awhile ago that Mrs. Springer and Mr. Springer, myself, are the sole owners of the camp. What more does Mr. Tavenner want?
Mr. VELDE. And have been since March or April of 1952?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct.
Mr. VELDE. Subject to a mortgage?
Mr. SPRINGER. That is correct, Bank of America.
Mr. VELDE. I think that answers the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. That does answer the question.
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Springer, will you tell the committee what other names you have used besides the name of Springer? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. What names does the Congressman have? I would like to know.
Mr. SCHERER. I am asking you what names you have used besides the name of Springer Springer wasn't your original name, I know that.
Mr. SPRINGER. Well, don't tell me that. This I resent. This I resent.
Mr. SCHERER. What other names have you used?
Mr. ESTERMAN. Ask him where he found out that that isn't your original name.
Mr. SPRINGER. I would like to have proof of that, Mr. Congressman, what other names, because you have made an accusation here against me.
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, I move that the witness be instructed to answer my question. What other names has he used?
Mr. VELDE. Do you understand what the question is, Mr. Witness?
Mr. SPRENGIR. The Congressman said what names do I use. My name is Joseph Springer.
Mr SCHIEER. What other names have you used other than Joseph Springer 2
Mr. DOYLE. If any 
Mr. SCHERER. In the past.
Mr. SPRINGER. I don't go around lying like some of your witnesses did here last week, or yesterday, rather.
Mr. SCHERER. Well, all I am asking you isMr. SPRINGER. And don't make any accusations against me like that because I think it is very unethical on your part. 410 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SCHERER. All right. You answer my question, then. Answer this question: Have you used any other names in the past other than Springer?
Mr. SPRINGER. I have not.
Mr. SCHERER. You have not used any other names other than Springer? What name did you use as a member of the Communist Party? 
Mr. SPRINGER. I refuse to answer that question on the previous grounds.
Mr. SCHIERE. Did you use another name as a member of the Com- munist Party?
Mr. SPRINGER. Same question and same answer.
Mr. SCHERER. Now are you an agent of the Russian Government? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.) 
Mr. ESTERMAN. Sit back and take it easy. We want to consult. (At this point Mr. Springer conferred further with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Chairman, would the Congressman from Ohio, I believe it isMr. SCHERER. That is right.
Mr. SPRINGER. Will you explain to me that question?
Mr. SCHERER. Are you an agent of the Russian Government?
Mr. SPRINGER. What does that mean?
Mr. SCHERER. Your attorney can tell you what an agent means.
Mr. EsTERMAN. His attorney can't because his attorney doesn't know what you mean. Do you mean is he a registered agent . 
Mr. SCHERER. No. I mean is he an agent, an agent of the Russian Government in any way, in any capacity? (At this point Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. I could only give you one answer. I can only answer in one way. I would like to answer it in a different way, but I could only answer it in one way, and that is on the statements that I made before under the fifth amendment.
Mr. SCHERER. You refuse to answer on the ground that your answer might incriminate you; is that right?
Mr. ESTERMAN. He doesn't say anything.
Mr. ScHERER. All right. If you were not an agent of the Russian Government would you so state?
Mr. SPRINGER. The same question, the same answer. 
Mr. SCHERER. Well, you can give the same answer but it is certainly not the same question. Now, are you an agent of the Communist Party?
Mr. SPRINGER. The same question and the same answer.
Mr. SCHERER. Were you ever an agent of the Communist Party?
Mr. SPRINGER. Same question and the same answer. I think I have told you that before. 
Mr. SCHERER. Now, have you ever received any compensation from the Russian Government? 
Mr. SPRINGER. I could only sayMr. SCHERER. Directly or indirectly?
Mr. SPRINGER. I could only answer you the same way as I did before. 
Mr. ESTERMAN. Take it easy. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 411 
Mr. SCHERER. Have you ever received any compensation from the Communist Party ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I could only answer you on the same grounds that I have stated before.
Mr. VELDE. And that is a declination to answer, you decline to answer the question?
Mr. SPRINGER. I decline to answer the question on the grounds I stated before.
Mr. ScHEER. I have no further questions?
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Jackson?
Mr JACKSON. I have no questions.
Mr. VELDn. Mr. Clardy?
Mr. CLARDY. No.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Walter?
Mr. WALTER. No.
Mr VELDE. Mr. Moulder?
Mr. MOULDER. No.
Mr. VELDE Mr Doyle? 
Mr. DOYLE. I heard an answer a few minutes ago, perhaps 5 or 6 questions back, in which you stated: "I am not lying like the other witnesses who testified yesterday." Who lied yesterday? Now, I am sure the record will show that you used some such term in which you said that witnesses lied to this committee yesterday. Now, to me, Mr. Chairman, that is, unless it is cleared up, equivalent to his charging in the same forum, that a witness or witnesses on yesterday were heard by him to lie or perjure themselves. He was here yesterday, apparently. Were you here yesterday, Mr. Springer?
Mr. SPRINGER. I was. 
Mr. DOYLE. So you heard the witnesses, apparently, to whom you referred when you said they lied. Now, if they lied they perjured themselves before this committee. Now, I am asking you to identify- and you were here and heard them-I am asking you now to identify whom you heard lie yesterday on that witness stand to this committee. I don't want all the witnesses to have the label of being liars by this witness. (At this point, Mr. Springer conferred with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. DOYLE. We certainly have no knowledge of any lying, perjured testimony, and if there was any we ought to know it, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. VELDE. I agree with you, Mr. Doyle, and I will allow the wit- ness to answer the question. (At this point, Mr. Springer conferred further with Mr. Esterman.)
Mr. SPRINGER. I expressed an opinion here yesterday-I expressed an opinion here just a little while ago on the answer to Mr. Doyle. I don't think that I have to explain my answer and I will not explain my answer.
Mr. VELDE. Has the witness finished with his answer?
Mr. ESTERMAN. Yes; he has finished.
Mr. DOYLE. I certainly try to give you every opportunity to explain it. One question more. You emphasized this was a children's camp, I suppose, during the summer. Do you have any classes for the children up there of any kind, any handcraft or any clay modeling, any blackboard classes, any swimming classes, any recreation classes? 412 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SPRINGER. I told you before, Mr. Doyle, I would be willing to give you a brochure where it exactly tells of our activities, horseback riding, swimming, artcraft, and various woodcraft and naturecraft, sewing-I mean weaving, various types of ball playing for the kids, and hikes, and et cetera.
Mr. DOYLE. I used to be a summer-camp director myself. I would assume you would do some of that. In any of these groups of children that you have during the summer, are they spoken to or instructed by any member of the Communist Party or at the request of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SPRINGER. I will refuse to answer this question, as I have refused in the past to answer, on the same grounds I have stated previously; fifth amendment.
Mr. DOYLE. What ages are the children you take into the camp ?
Mr. SPRINGER. From 7 to 15.
Mr. DOYLE. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. VELDE. Does counsel have any other questions?
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. VELDE. IS there any reason why this witness should be retained under subpena any longer ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. VELDE. If not, the witness is excused, and the committee will stand in recess for 10 minutes. (Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing during the recess, which was from 3: 28 to 3:43 p. m.)
Mr. JACKSON. The committee will come to order. The committee is in receipt of a number of communications protesting the blackout of the television hearings, and it is felt that a very brief statement in this connection is desirable. There is involved in the question of television of committee hearings a constitutional question, and for that reason the committee has seen fit to take the position that, pending a clearcut legal decision in the matter, witnesses objecting to being televised on the witness stand will not be so televised. The committee, contrary to the charges and allegations of many of its critics, operates within the laws of the land and is subject to court decisions and findings on matters pertinent to its inquiries. Television, so far as committee sessions are concerned, is largely in the formative stage and clearcut decisions have not been made on many problems arising from the use of television as a medium of public information in connection with committee investigations. Forcing a witness to appear before the television camera, in spite of his protests, and in the light of previous decisions, in effect deprives the committee of its power to institute legal procedure against recalcitrant witnesses or to cite for contempt in instances where it is deemed desirable. The committee is certain that the people of southern California will appreciate the realities of the situation as they exist, and will understand the necessity for the occasional periods of blackout. We ask for that understanding on the part of the people who are listening.
Mr. CLARDY. May I add one word?
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Clardy.
Mr. CL.ADY. Another phase of that, I think, we ought to call attention to is the fact that both the television and the press have given COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 413 an excellent service. The press has been giving, I think, the best coverage I have seen anywhere, and I want to commend them for what they have been doing. The telegrams before us are overwhelmingly favorable to television, but I think we ought to let everyone know that what they missed on television this afternoon they can at least partially get from the press.
Mr. DOYLE. The gentlemen would expect that kind of service in California.
Mr. CLARDY. Always a Californian.
Mr. JACKSON. Now that the chamber of commerce discussion is finished do you have a witness now, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. May I make an announcement?
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. During the course of the testimony of Mr. Bart Lytton, a message was received by me, raising the question of possible lack of proper identification of the witness, inasmuch as there was another person by the name, somewhat similar, that was in the screenwriting field. I thought I made it perfectly clear in the course of my questioning that the witness on the stand was a different person from Mr. Herbert Lytton, who is now engaged in screenwriting. But in order there be no possible misunderstanding about the matter, I want to read a message which I received. The message is as follows, Mr. Herbert Lytton, Social Security Number, 555-227-522, of 1819 Taft Building, called and said he is having telephone complaints regarding the questioning of Bart Lytton now on the stand, who is also a screenwriter. Of course, the testimony was that Mr. Lytton is not now a screenvwrter. Nevertheless, that was the message. Then I was requested in this message to announce publicly the Mr. Herbert Lytton is not the party in question. I don't see how anything could have been plainer than what I brought out. If it wasn't, I think this covers the situation.
Mr. JACKSON. It meets the situation. Do you have a witness, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. I would like to call Silvia Richards.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give to this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God ?
Mrs. RICHARDS. I do.
Mr. JACKSON. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Has the witness been sworn?
Mr. JACKSON. Yes. TESTIMONY OF SILVIA RICHARDS
