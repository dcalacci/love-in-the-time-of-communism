PUBLIC hEtAING The Committee on Un-American Activities met, pursuant to adournment, at 10:14 a. in., in room 518, Federal -Building, Hon. Harold H. Velde (chairman) presiding. Committee members present: Representutives Harold H. Velde (chairman) Donald L. Jackson, Kit Clardy Gordon H. Scherer, Francis E. iValter, Clyde Doyle and James B. FPrazier, Jr. Staff members present: Frank S. Tavenner Jr counsel; Louis J. Russell, chief investigator; Thomas W. Beale, Sr cAief clerk; Raphael i. Nixon, director of research; and William A. Wheeler, investigator.
Mr. VELW. The committee will come to order.
Miss Reporter, let the record show that present are Mr. Jackson,
Mr. Clardy, Mr. Scherer, Mr. Walter Mr. Doyle, Mr. Frazier, and the chairman Mr. Velde, a quorum of the full committee. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before calling the first witness, may I call to the attention of the public a message I have received from a person by the name of Lewis Allen.
Mr. VELE. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVNNZR. During the course of the testimony of Mrs. Silvia Richards, reference was made near the end of her testimony to a position taken by a person b~y the name of Lewis Allen with reference to writers who played an important part in the war effort. Now, this telegram has been received from a Lewis Allen, who states he is not the Lewis Allen referred to in that message. I think possibly I should read the telegram.
Mr. VELDE. Proceed and read the telegram. 
Mr. TAVENNER (reading): DtEA SI: Silvia Richards in her testimony yesterday stated that a Lewis Allen and his wife were members of the screen writers' group in the Communist Party. I wish to state that I am not the Lewis Allen referred to. I am a motion.picture director, not a writer, and I have never belonged to any writers' group or guild. This confusion came up once before and almost cost me a Job but fortunately it was corrected in time. In order to avoid a repetition of this and in view of the wide publicity of your hearing I would be very grateful If you would make a public statement. Thank you.

You stated further that during the course of the conversation this person iuade reference to the fact that if you didn't get this cleared up your uaUe would be "Mud" in this comnnu11ity. I asked you who made that statement to you and you said Mr. George Beck. Now, the expression that you made about the necessity of clearing up of this matter else your name would be "Mud" in this community has been interpreted in some sources as having constituted a threat on the part of George Beck as it means or a weapon to compel you to come into the party. If that is true, I want you to state so clearly, and if it isn't true, if that isn't the correct interpretation of your testimony, I would like for you to clarify that.
Mr. L-rrov . Well, George Beck is about as threatening as the St. Louis Browns. No, sir, George Beck was not threateiiing me. I didn't take it as a threat. I took it quite differently at the time and I would again conclude today that his purpose was not, to threaten me, Mr. Tavenner. His purpose was to advise me. That was the manner in which he approached it and that is the manner in which he handled it straight firough, because more than tlat occurred. George's attitude at the time, and he and I are friends, and although I haven't seen George for many, many years, his attitude seemed to COMMUNIWV A(TIVVITII* IN 'IMI 1AI4 ANOI.GHd ARICA 441 be "lhiis 191ot, good( for yol.

Mr. CLARDY. Isn't that the normal use of that word I You call a man itstool pigeon because )e is telling the authorities of something that has been done of an unlawful nature.
Mr. Lyro)N. Well, I think that the term has been used a bit more broadly than that, Congressman. I think that sometimes it is used in labor circles in regard to anyone who talks to even management incertain instances.
Mr. CJJARY. But you generally find a red taint in connection with tile use of that word by that person; do you not I
Mr. Lyvrox. Well, I didn't know that the people referred specifically to a conspiracy. I can only say that to le it clearly is evidence of a feeling of conspiracy.
Mr. CLAnRmy. They certainly are not on our side.
Mr. Lrro;. Let us put it that way. 442 COMMNIST ACTIVITIES IN TIM LOS ANGLES AREA 
Mr. TAVfENNER. As a result of the various experiepces that you had In Hollywood, after you arrived here, did you finally unite with the Communist Party again? Air. Lrr.N. Well, let me continue In regard to the last question and this question, because we have a basic continuity there. I want to reiterate, so there is no question about it, that George Beck didn't threaten me. (leorge Beck was counseling me to the best of his knowledge and belief that this is what would happen. I think that. George Beck would corrloborite at any time that he said it to me and that he advised me to handle the matter by clearing these charges up. Ho pointed out at the time that if charges like this were bandied about, that not only the members of the Coinmunist Party, but that liberals and nanny people who had no particular politics would hear vatgute and disturbing things about me, or perhaps specific things, and that they would then consider me anathema, to their to their way of living or their principles or anything else. And he felt that the waves of such a reaction could be disastrous to my career and to my sense of well-being, because my first response was "Oh, chuck it; I am not going to do anything about it." After several conversations on the matter, I had to conclude it was important. I was angry about it, and ns more came to me my anger mounted. It was based on no facts. It was based on neither evidence nor what proved later to be factual, so I began to set to work with a will. I was put in contact with an Elizaheth Glenn. 1 was given to understand that she was in a membership capacity in the Coxmunist Party in Hollywood.
Mr. TAvENNER. Did site have another name at that time, to your knowledge?
Mr. Lrrow. You know, I may have given the wrong name there. Is it LeechI
Mr. TAvvNNmR. Our information is she was known at different times by both of those names, Glenn and Leech.
Mr. LyTToN. I see. I don't recall. I know I have heard both references, and I don't know her. I was put in contact with her by Beck, and she reviewed the story with me. She told me that there were a number of charges leveled against me in New York. I had done everything, apparently, but set fire to my mother. She stated that I had been expelled from the party, according to the best of their knowledge, and that I had been considered as unreliable, a provocateur-a term frequently bandied about-and that I had stolen a typewriter from the Communist Party headquarters and had pawned same, and that I had deserted the party. The party likes faithful lovers and many other things. I don't even recall them all: Now, if she said that I deserted the party, I said, "Well, this is true." But as to the typewriter incident, there was no truth in it whatsoever. As to having been expelled, as far as I knew there was no truth in it whatsoever, and presented the charges. I asked her what I could do about it. Well, it didn't seem that I could do very much about it. I asked her if there was such a thing as a hearing. She said, well they take care of it in their own way. She said she would correspond with New York. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANORLEB AREA 448 I said, "Well, you ought to know something next week." She said, "No, it will be longer than that." Many months went by and- I became more and more agitated, because now a process began. People previously friendly to me were no longer friendly. I would arrange to have dinner with friends, my wife and I, and at the lost minute the dinner date would be canc4ed. I would walk into gild meethgM and backs would be turned if I went to enter the conversations avid I became very agitated at this. It is not pleasant, and I still didn't fully understand it. I understood the emanation of it. I meant to say that I wits not equipped to handle it at this time. It therefore became a struggle on my part, I should say, and a very important one, to clear these particular charges. I wasn't concerned at that time with the issue of the Communist Party. I was concerned with the fact that apparently a rumor factory and a very competent rumor factory wts at work. Ohe incident brought it into its sharpest focus. I had been a proliflic provider of material for USO camp shows. As a matter of fact, I believe, I was told by the USO that I wrote more camp show material than auy other writer in the United States, and was commended by them for that. Some of my sketches had played to as many, I wits told, as 6 million meni. It seemed like an awful lot to me. And I doubted it, but nevertheless I knew they were played to many, many Army camps and installations throughout-where tightinF forces were stationed. rilhe USO w~as trying to .get comedy material unslanted, and they arranlgedl at the Screen Writers' Guild-not the Screen Writers' Guild, the 11ollywood Writers' 11obilization-to have an evening in which theT would showv the kind of material that they wanted. 'I hey gave me what was to the Communist the kiss of death. It shows my material as unslanted material. That evening Carole Landis and Fay McKenzie and Ed Lorre who ran USO camp shows, entertainment division came down together with others--I don't recall whom-to the ollywood-Roosevelt Hotel, and they played these sketches. Now, this one sketch was the forerunner of a type of sketch that has become tiresome enough since. It was a psychiatric sketch. At the time there hadn't been psychiatrist sketches of this character. It was a very funny sketch, and it had played already with teams taking it out and stars requesting to take it out, even though it had ben old material by this time, they still wanted to take it out to military installations. The sketch was played, and most of the writers present sat on their hands. They didn't laugh, they didn't applaud, they didn't like it. This was rather unusual, in view of the fact that by that time several hundred thousand American 01's had laughed their heads off at the sketch. And these were supposed to be judges of material. It was brought in because it was to be the top laugh producer that the USO had in its repertoire. They sat on their hanas, and I was deeply agitated by this. I began to feel by this time that I was involved in a crusade. I hadn't done what was charged. The feelings at that time were not political; they were personal. I wanted to clear a name and be able to work again and work in peace. 444 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TILE LOS ANGELES AREA I don't know how many months ensued. It dissolves, as you sy in motion-picture terminology. But lots of time elapsed. In the course of this time I did everything that I know to do to clear the so-called charges. Subsequently I was engad to do a documentary fl m by Prince. ton Film Center, the Rockefeller Foundation subsidizing it, in Gloucester, Mass., on war shipbuilding. I wont up there and did the film and came back through Now York. In New York I went to Communist Party headquarters on 13th Street, and I told them my story. I told them that there was this story extant on the west coast, that it wasn't true, and I wanted them to produce for me any records which indicated any truth in these particular charges. q I also said to them, "If these charges are true, would you have a record I" They said, "Oh, certainly, we would. If the charges are true, believe me, we will have them.I About a half hour passed and a girl came to me who introduced herself as an organization secretary, I believe, I don't recall. In sviy event, I was taken to another floor. I waited some more. 8he came back down and told me, "Not only are there no charges against you, but somebody up stairs knew you who says you are a md hty fine fellow." She said, "No; we have no record whatsoevere and, therefore there wouldn't be any truth in these charges." I said, "Well, they seem to believe it in the West." She said, "Well, that is pretty far away. What do you want us to do about it I" I said, "For heaven's sake, lot them know that these charges are untrue and tell them to stop their rumor factory." She said, "We will be very glad to." I appreciated that. I came back to the coast. I got in touch with the same people. No word from New York. More time went on months. Finally, apparently there was word from New York. I aon't know what oiircuitous routes it took, whether it came out by carrier pigeons or how, but, in any event, apparently the word came out at that time that I was cleared in New York and that the charges were groundless. This Elizabeth Leech Glenn again contacted me and told me that I was cleared and they regretted very much the fact that I had been so badly treated as a result of It, she was sorry, and she sent a rather inept public-relations officer, I might say, to see me at my home, who explained that in revolutionary situations the innocent must die with the guilty, it is just too bad. "We are sorry, fellow, that this hap. pened to you. We are sorry that for a year and a half now," or a year, whatever the time was, "we understand, it is awful," she said. "Once up in Michigan the same thing happened to me, I was called a renegade," she said, "a Trotskyite, and some kind of deviationist." She said, "I lived through that, and I know what it is and I understand," and so forth. "And it is too bad, but you mustn't have any ill feeling toward the party. You must understand it. You must be a Bolshevik."
Mr. TAvrsmm. Do you recall the name of the emissary that came to see you I COMMUNIST ACTIVITIPA IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 445 
Mr. Ln rox. Her name and her face blotted out from my memory, I think instantly. I found it itparticularly painful interview, I didn't like it.; I was tincoinfortable and tlnhappy about it. I have novel, seen her before or since. I can only state that sho stated site was from Michigan. More than that I do not know. As a matter of fact, she didn't give me a name. I might make that point clear, Mr. Tavenner. People are not necessarily intro. duced to each other formally in tile Communist Party, and first names are often used. You will learn a name, but you are not necessarily brought up to itperson and someone doesn't say "Comrade So-andSo, meet Cotnlrado So-and-So." It isn't done th1is way, at least in this short experience that I had. So I don't know who sihe was.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, may I a4sk a question itthis point? . I
Mr. VE,.,. Yes.
Mr. JACKsON. YoU were told dutrin the ciurise of this interview that in the process of itrevolution the innocent sometimes had to stiffer along with the guilty. Did that strike you as being inconsistent with the party line as it generally operates? This hysterical cry of smear that you hear from the Commuists, from tile fellow-traieling press, this hysterical dentnciation of committees of this kind, simply beeau tiii tile course of tile investigation sometimes, as happened yesterday, an innocent name is mentioned, which the committee attempts on all occasions to correct immediately, but, still this cry goes on, "(m.uil by asso(eiltion, Faseists, witehhunting, everyred baiting," were, according to yoir statement, they accept its day practice tile fact that a lot of innocent people are going to get hurt during this revolutionary period. This seems to me to be itvery glaring inconsistency in what they say and what they practice. That is not a question. It is simply an observation, because it made a marked impression on me. The comrades talk out of one side of their mouth about one thing, and out of the other about something else.
Mr. Lyr'roN. Well, Congressman Jackson, for a long time I wanted to say, "I dig you, Jackson," Laughter.]
Mr. VFtmWE. May we be Inorder, please.
Mr. Ly'roN. I would say if you.are trying to pinpoint one incon. sistency to the Communist Party, it might take us longer than your terms in Congress to pinpoint all the inconsistencies in thie Communist Party and its line.
Mr.JACKsoN. Tie committee has been working for many years to pinpoint a few of them. However, this is an important one.
Mr. LYrroN. I think so. I think it is a very important one. You and I are of a different political stripe. I am a Democrat and you are a Republican.
Mr. JACKsON. That is the hallmark of America.
Mr. LYTroN. Nonetheless, we can sit and discuss our differences, and we have; not you and 1,but a couple of Republicans have with me, and other Democrats.
Mr. CAtry. We haven't had any differences up to date.
Mr. Lr'rro. Well, me might.
Mr. CLrWY. Don't work on it too hard.

Mr. Ln'troN;. Well, a fellow Pennsylvanian, I can answer you in this fashion: No, sir, you did not have tile same experience. You see, tile majority of tile people you knew backed your position. The majority of the people you knew and had to work witi still respected and admired you. But tlis wasn't the case in my instance, because the story became broader and broader. And in the Screen Writers' Guild, since I had identified myself in voting consistently for a number of years with the leftists, even though I was not intile l)arty, I had voted with them on virtually every issue, and tley were fighting at that time to build a guild and they weren't political in their attitude for the guild at that time. I felt they were fighting to build a strong Screen Writers' Guild and I voted with them on issue after issue, as I recall, and I was probably COMMUNIM' A(VlIVITII04 IN TiE 1,014 ANORLETS AIlA 447 liilH of iminy muleel writers.

Well, whilt occurred when you went to that meetTr. LY'JrroN. I couldn't possibly tell you, since I didn't go to that meeting. I was called thIo night before the meeting was canceled. Said, "I see. When is the next meeting?" "You will be called and told." T'hat is that.
Mr. rAVENNEJ. Can you tell ,s who gave you this information I
Mr. LwroN. No. Just someone called andsaid, "Is this Bart Lytton I" "Yes." 'Bart, this is Mary," or Jane, or something like that. I don't know the name-I mean it was just the first name that was given to me on the telephone. And "I was told to contact you. The meeting is canceled." Now, I knew a Sam Moore. I hadn't been at the meeting, so I didn't know what Sam Moore's home it was. I knew it was Sam Moore on Rossmore. And I knew a Sam Moore, and I knew him as president of the Radio Writers' Guild. I saw this Sam Moore subsequently, in the next couple of weeks, and I said, "Sam, what about that meeting at your house.

Wherever I turned I was astounded that while the party was notJarge, they had as inany areas of Influence as the had in Hollywood. Made several attempts to have a hearing on he matter. I didn't want to get back in the Coinmtuust Party. I wanted no part of It. I had learned everything I had to learn about Itand everything it represented, but I wanted a hearing because I wanted to be confronted with any evidence that might exist, and I wanted to mio what they had to say. I was never afforded a hearing. I was never afforded any opportunity. I was told, "We don't have to give you a hearing. We don't have to listen to you. We know what you are." I asked who told then those things, and they said, "That is our business," and so forth. The feeling there was simply that I was guilty because I was seen with an Army officer who was known to be an Intelligence officer. The Army officer was my brother. He wits a captain in the field artillery.
Mr. thAoKsON. So that was guilt by association. 
Mr. L mN. Yes, sir; guilt by association.
Mr. JACKsoN. Isn't that a very relrehensible thing in the Communist Party parlance I
Mr. LrroN. I think"gtuilt by association" isgenerally rerelensible and I think the Communists have very poor grace in ever accusing anyone else of it.
Mr. fAc.KsoiN. Except for the fact that a bank cashier who travels around with thugs and holdup men. He doesn't hold his job very long, does heV
Mr. LrrroN. I don't know what you mean.
Mr. JACKSON. That would be guilt by association. 
Mr. LrrroN. I see what you mean; yes, that is right.
Mr. JACKSON. But the Communists do practice guilt by association.
Mr. LyrtoN. Most assuredly they do. There is no question about that.
Mr. CL.,wy. Of course, they never assassinate anybody's character. 
Mr. Lrrro. They did their darndest to assassinate mine. Well, let us put it this way: I was no longer welcome in any of the circles I previously knew. People would not talk to me about it. The very nice people to whom [-am indebted for my appearance here today, Pauline and Leo Townsend, I went to, because I had seen them at a meeting, and I asked them what it was about, and at that time they weren't out of the decompression chamber and they.appeared nervous and ill at ease about the matter, and said that I had- better talk to somebody else. They were the only people, incidentally, who would even speak to me about it Others just simply turned their backs.
Mr. Dou. You mean that only Communists who would talk to youI
Mr. Lrrror. No, sir; I wouldn't sy-I will put it a little strong than "only Communists." I would may that tfe Reds have a lot of fellow travelers, as you know, and you get to know pretty well who the fellow travelers are or you would my, "Well, mabe ti s j1uo is a Communist. I don't know whlmt be is a Communist rar member but I know he is a Cummunkt or i fellow traveler." The allow travelers, in turn. have influence at concentric circles, influence upon liberals, we will may, and this gwes on. Now, they t COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TIE LOS ANOELES AItRA 453 didn't care what they said and they said many things that had no hasis in fact whatsoever.
Mr. CLARDY. What you are trying to say is that they are the most intolerant people on earth.
Mr. LrroN. Tolerance is not even considered to be a virtue in the Communist Party, according to its teachings. 
Mr.CLAIIDY. You are agreeing with me, then, I take it?
Mr. LyrroN. Most assuredly.
Mr. TAVrNNF.R Well, as a result of your experience in the Com- munist Party, you left the field of screen writing; is that what I understandI
Mr. Lnrov. Well, let us say that it was certainly a large contributing factor. I was unable to secure another job in town. I had the interesting experience, incidentally, of being told by a couple of producers tlt I was a known Communist. I said, "1low did you learn that I" And he said, "Well, your name was dropped by a couple of people I know to be Communists." This was in that period. In other words, if it was necessary to state that I was a Communist not to get a job, they would do it that way.
Mr. DoYl,. May I ask this question Y
Mr. VEWE. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DoYi, I hope you will see the pertinence of my question, sir. 1p until the time of .your trouble with the Communist Party leadership, as a sc een writer you had been financially successful?
Mr. LJrroN. I certainly had.
Mr. ID)oYL. Thank you.
Mr. TAvFNqNER. You mentioned the name of Mr. Stanley Praeger. Will you spell that for me?
Mr. LrrorN. P-r-a-e-g-e-r0 I believe.
Mr. TAvzNNzr. What is his occupation-what was it at that time?
Mr. L0row. Oh, he was a road show Lou Costello. That is what you call a poor man's comic. lie used to appear at all social affairs ana do skets and skitches-"skets and skitches," that is interesting. And he was, I think, for a time employed at Twentieth Century-Fox a a comedian.
Mr. TAvZNNrYJ. Since the time of your withdrawal from the Coinmunist Party or your expulsion, have you engaged in any Conuntuist Party activities, to your knowledge I
Mr. Lrrrmo. No, sir. In the decompression period, which we will speak of again, I supported Henry Wallace in 1948 in his candidacy for the Piesidency of the United States, before the campaign and during part of it, fut before the campaign was over however, I didn't like the associations that it required and I ceased that support. I voted for him, however.
Mr. TAvzWUL I believe, Mr. Chairman, that is all I desire to ask.
Mr. Vaw& Mr. Jackson.
Mr.JACISOX. Your contention, as I unlermtand it, Mr. Lytton, is that as a result of you bretk with tho party that you wveri m turn, reviled and blackliied by these with whom you hd ptWriosy be aiwiociated !

Mr. Doy'a-. Air. Cliairman, I wish to say this to the witle... I join heartily in thanking 3Ol for coming ad exposing the colispiracy which you ilid and the mnlner in whieli you did iL And in cOnlnee, tion with that eompliItent to you, T wish,'Mr. Chairman, to say while I do not have more than just personal aequaintance with the counsel now sitting beside the witness, lie had with him yesterday a very able, distinguished attorney, who lives in my old congressional district in Los Angeles County, andlI want to comIipliment him, and the partner here today, counsel for this witness, as men of the bar, successful as they are, taking time to come to this sort of a proceeding and add dignity and patriotic attitude by the bar toward the United States Congress. . Before I close, Mr. Chairman, I have received so many requests; both orally here and over the phone, and by messenger, where people are asking under what basic law this committee functions. I have had four quesions to that effect this morning. While I have often referred to this, I believe it is pertinent, in view of the observations by (MtJNiM'ip ACrOTIP IN IR fli dit-il~ilml(Ol coljulte Iltli LrMhAi AN(IPM , hi from Old, il epiw A~I'A 467 ly tht0,.

Miss GI=T. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENX. What are your screen credits?
Miss GILBEr. It is hard to remember the work that you do. Put it this way: From 1932 to 1938 1 worked mainly in the theater. From 1938 to-no, because I was in pictures before there was a Screen Writers' Guild-from 1937 to 1947 1 worked mainly in pictures.
Miss GuL1I.RaT. What were the main screen credits that you re- ceived?

Miss Gu.ipwr. Well, the Long Beach papers said that I would be a talkative witness, and I don't want to disprove anything that is printed in the press.
Mr. TAVHNNER. Just tell the committee what your principal screen credits have been during the period froimn 19:38 to 1948.
Miss Gnaimnr. Well, I mean anything I dil-you know, I did pictures with Gary Cooper, for one, a couple with #John Wayne, andMr. 'l'AVPNNER. What were they?

Mr. T1AVENNER~. I sayv,will you tell us what they were?
Miss GILBER. 'rhe picturesV One of the pictures I remember that I did with Cooper was the first one for which lie won the Academy Award, and the second picture that I did with Gary Cooper I remem- ber specifically because he is such a fine actor.
Mr. TAvrNNEIt. My only question-just a moment,, please. My only questionMisq GnptT. The second picture was with Mr. DeMille.
Mr. TAviE-NNE. If you will just confine yourself to answering my questions and naming the pictures, that is 'all I have asked you.
Miss GILBERT. Well, I remember those two specifically.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there any other pictures that you received screen credits for, major screen pictures?
Miss GimiBRT. Oh, I am so sorry. ,I didn't know-you want the screen credit--because I don't think I received screen credits for many of them at all. I received very good notices.
Mr. TAVEFn. All right, then, I will change that question and ask you what were some of the major pictures in which you took part?
Miss Gitrr. Well now, that again is a matter of semantics. I have given you two or three major pictures. The one that I remember most is the one that I-the one I remember the most is one in which I got the best notices.
Mr. TAP1ER. You are still not answering, and I will have to with. draw my question, because you don't make your answers responsive. GILiRT. I am terribly sorry, Mr. Tavenner, but I worked in

Miss GILBERT. Would you spell the last name, please? 
Mr. TAvNER. The spelling was N-a-r-c-i-s-e-n-f-e-l-d.
Miss GILBERT. One moment. May I confer with my counsel? 
Mr. Tavenner, would it be possible for us to confer for about 2 minutes? It is a little difficult. Nobody is more aware of dead air than I am.
Mr. TAvE ER. I am willing for you to consult with counsel, of course, but I haven't asked you a question yet.
Miss GILBERT. I know you haven't, but this creates a question for me, you see. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well.
Miss GILBERT. Go ahead, Mr. Tavenner. I am sorry I interrupted you. 
Mr. TAVEXNER. It is quite all right. You have been identified as having been a member of the Communist Party byMiss GILBERT. "You are all going to have to be quiet, because I can't hear. I beg your pardon. M'. vzE Let's a have order please.
Miss GILBERT. Thank youMr. Velde.
Mr. TA vFJNER. I Say you have been identified by Mr. Harvey Narcisenfeld as having been a member of the Communist Party, and I want to ask you about that. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA
Miss GiLBERT. Do you really expect me to answer that? 
Miss You hope I will I 467 
Mr. J'AENNER. Well, I hope you will. GuILBRT. 
Mr. TAVENNEI. Yes.
Miss GILBERT. Why didn't you conte to my house and ask me that, or bring ie down here quietly'?
Mr.TAVENNE . Mr. Chairman, I ask that she be directed to answer the question.
Mr. VELuE. Yes, Miss Gilbert, you are directed to answer that question. It is very simple and entirely in accord with your rights in this matter.
Miss GILBERT. Do you direct me to answer this question, Mr. Veldef
Mr. VELDE. Yes, Miss Gilbert, please.
Miss GILBERT. Thank you Mr. Velde. I hope you will be quiet because I am an actress and I am accustoied to these lights and le mikes and everything else, but I hope that these people will not infer that because Istop to think before I speak, thit there is anything guilty connected with it. I decline theprivilege of answering this question, and I have certain grounds on which I decline, and I would like to invoke the 19th amendment, which gives me equal rights to decline, and have just a few' moments to answer it. 
Mr. TAvENz;. Well, we understand that that is one ground. Do you have any other ground I
Miss GILBERT. I have not given my legal grounds, Mr. Tavenner. I have asked for just a moment to give my legal grounds,
Mr. TAVzNNER. I understood you to say that you were relying on the 19th amendment.
Miss GILnErr. I did not say that. I said that I would like to invoke the privilege of relying on the 19th amendment. Is it permitted, Mr.-VeldeV
Mr. VELDE. Certainly.
Miss GiLBERT. Thank you. I have certain grounds, certain very definite grounds, Mr. Tavenner. Ifyou don't photographers mind, I will ose . for you afterward; I will be glad to~addressing
Mr. TAvEzqNF. There is no one attempting to photograph you. 
Miss Gnmrr. The Herald-Express put such an ugly picture in the paper of ine the other day my mother tore it up.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, I think I have the same complaint to make.
Mr. VELDE. Please'proceed.
Miss GuzEwr. I am terribly sorry. I am trying to concentrate.
Mr. VALD. This is a serious matter. 
Miss Gumr. It certainly is. I lost my job. My grounds for declining what I consider to be the priilege of answering this question don't have anything to do with the press or the cameras or the people that are watching, or anything, except for the very profound respect in which I hold the Congress of the United States. You may find this hard to believe, but I took an oatl I was going to tell the truth and this respect is the truth. Beyond that I have a very profound respect for myself. No matter whether or not I have acted like a clown or make jokes or tried to find some comfort in some way to speak publicly, I have this respect and I thank you, Mr. Velde, 408 I COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THR L0S ANGLES AtIOA for allowing me Just a few minutes. I will try to be very short, because I know I talk too much. I have three grounds on which I want to decline tie privilege.
Mr. '1',V mNP.1. Will you name them, please l 
Mr. CLAR mvM. Mr. Chairman, I move the witness be hrected by the chairman to answer the question.
Mr. VEainm. Yes. If you decline to answer these questions relathi to your connection with the Conunuist Party, it should be on a le t basis. 
Miss Giaour A legal basis? 
Mr. VWi., Yes. Yollr legul grounds for not answering.
Miss Gutnrr. I will try to be very short. When yon sustain tile shock of a lifetime, being stopped in your pI'ofessio ,with 11O excuses, no reasons given, and you see-you sit. for' maly days and you watcl people of brilliance being tortured, it isn't easy to choose the right words to say at the moment of decision. My legal grounds are actually based on powers of reasoning which I ant not allowed to expound here, as other people have ben, so that women don't have equal rights. They are based on the fiflh Colmandment, which reads, "Honor thy father and thy mother that, thy days may be prolonged in tile land whieh tile Lord thy (lod has given thee." I choose to interpret this to mean forefathers. For that very reason I accepted, accept it as a privilege to be allowed to say, with all the lights on, everybody listening, that the fifth amendment was written for tile protection of tile innocent. It says nowhere ill the fifth amendment that anyone will be compelled to bear witness against themselves. There is not one word in1the fifth amendment about self-incrimination. I an not a lawyer, though I have conferred with lawyers and I have called to so many people it Wollhl make your head swim. If you think I amMr. VEIua. Now, your statement is not responsive to the question.
Miss Oth[nimT. I an sorry. I didn't finish.
Mr. Vimmm. Do you decline to answer the question?
Miss GILBERT. I decline. I haven't finished my reasons. Do you withdraw the question?
Mr. Vem:. Bo you rely on the 5th ameudnent as well as the 19th alurndlnent for your refusal to answer ?
Miss GILnRT. Mr. Velde, I actually rely ol tle Constitution of the United States and the ten eomnandments, because of tile fact I am aware that the fifth amendment was written for the protection of the innocent, and I rely on tie fifth amendment. I an not hiding behind it. I am standing right in front of it.

Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, she was.
Mr. TAVENNER. That you were a member of that same group?
Mrs. ADAMS. I was. 
Mr. TAVENNF.R. Now, in tle course of Mrs. Fleury's testimony she described a rather violent disagreement, I should say a positive disagreement, between herself and Mr. Ed Biberman regarding the use of art. Can you enlighten the committee, or do you recall the incident ?
Mrs. ADAms, Yes, I do. It was on an occasion, I think it was an educational, open educational meeting where there were both Communists and non-Communists present, and the discussion had to do with art and whether or not an artist should express himself in any way 11e chose or whether 11e should just reflect social influences, and-=. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THN'iiLO ANOi.,1*4 Aft-i.A 473 well, I Rin not really an artist, and it is a little above my head, but that waiH tie genera idea.

Mrs. ADAMs. He w1ts well known.
Mr. TAvNN.Ei. And prominent in fhe work of the Communist Party, within the knowledge of Communist Party members?
Mrs. ADAMs. Yes, I believe so. Alr. TAVENNER. Did you have the feeling that he wits a person who spoke with some authority for the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. Oh, yes. lie had that manner.
Mr. TAVENNFR. And so if a person of that character and reputation and personality of Mr. Biberman advocated a principle, it was a matter that necc. sitrlly hadlweight with other Communist Party members, wouldn't you say?
Mrs. ADAMS. Yes, to a degree.
Mr. ''AVErNNER. And on this particular occasion he was endeavoring to lead the membership of the Communist Party into the line of carry- ing out some special design in their art? By design I mean some purpose.
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, the art phase of the Communist Party was never that rigid. Actually, the fact that they had, that Mrs. Fleury and
Mr. Biberman had discusson-it was not like a debate, it was simply a discussion, and the two ideas were thrown out for whoever was listening to select.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall the circumstances tinder which Mrs. Fleury left the Communist Party?
Mrs. ADAMS. I think it had something to do with her disagreement with Mr. Biberman.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was because of her disagreement with the Communist Party purpose to direct how site should practice her art
Mrs. ADAMS. Well, I think that the party was more in favor of
Mr. Bliberman's approach than it was Mrs. Fleury's.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that resulted in her leaving the Communist PartyI

Mrs. ADAMS. I think it has to do with how I got the attitude which made me respohid. In about 1935 or 1936 a friend of the studio who had done a little acting in college or something like that, I believe, asked me if I would like to visit the Contemporary Theater, which was, I believe, a leftwing theater in Los Angeles. COMMUNITY ACI'IVII'IS IN Triii L0 ANOMiLiES A.tPA 478 She didn't tell file what kind of theater It was, She list aid Contem!porrlry Thoeiter, will eoliflm worry Rollil(ded--wel, it sRolinled nil right to me, so I wetlt with her.

ItLwtis su0h it novel situalion to ine that there was no other choice. At that time I was working at Leon Schlesinger Productions and at that time a number of the cartoonists joined a union in the studio not the cartoonists' union, but one of the craft unions, a very small group of craft unions it was, and they asked me if I would be interested injoining that. I said "Yes,' anything to improve conditions in the studio. So I joined, and about the second meeting I went to, the union that we belonged to decided that we were too small a group for them to bother wit, and about that time a number of unorganized different crafts in the studios were organizing independent organizations for the pur. poses of collective bargaining, and- another small group who was in this other union decided they would also organize, and the cartoonists were interested. Well, we were very green in the matter of organization. We knew absolutely nothing about what we had to do.
Mr. TAVE.NER. I don't quite understand when you say "we."

Mr. TAV NNER. TIhen you were the sole owner of the corporations
Mr. LAZARUS. Of this $5,000 of the stock.
Mr. TAv~xxER. Yes. That being all the stock and you being the holder of all of it-Mr. LAZARUS. That is correct. 
Mr. TAvxxNER. You were the sole owner of the corporation?
Mr. LAZARUS. AMr. Tavenner, I really don't know the legal end of thatMr. TAVENNER. There may have been qualifying shares in the names of other persons, in order to make up the necessary number of directors under the California law.
Mr. LAzARUs. Not that I know of.
Mr. 'ITAvENNEIR. There were no other stockholders?
Mr. LAZARUS. There were no other stockholders, so far as I know. As far as I remember-as far as I know. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Then to be certain, you were the sole owner of the corporation?
Mr. LAZARUS. That is correct. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of the stock of the corporation?
Mr. LAZARUS. That is right. 
Mr. TAVENNER. How many pictures had your corporation produced before you resigned or left the position of president? .Mr. LAZARUS. They were about finishing a picture. They were about to finish one production.
Mr. TAVENNER. ne production. What was that picture?
Mr. LAZARUS. The title, the working title of that picturee was Salt of the Earth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Had you produced any other picture or worked in the production of any other pictures besides that one? (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. We did not l)roduce any other picture besides this one.I 
Mr. TAvxE- . Had you contracted for any picture other than that (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. There were agreements made for one other picture. Some oral agreement was made about another picture that we had in mind to make. However, no other pictures were made by the corporation.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was that agreement made for the production of another pictures
Mr. LAZARUS. That must have been about a year ago we were con- templating to nmiake that picture.
Mr. TAvwNNER. Did you abandon the production of the other picture that you have reference to?
Mr. LAZARUS Yes we did. 
Mr. TAvxNER. This is a California corporation, is it not?

Mr. LAz~nus. At the present time I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNit. Who is the secretary of the corporation ? (At this point Mr. ILaizaruis confferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. L.,Azuvs. Mi. Taviier, to answer this question I)ertainig to iamies that you will ask me from now on ill, of any names, I will ask the privilege of refuse to answer. I have it slight knowledge of the workings of this committeeMr. 'rAENm:n. Let 111 Lsk you it question at this point. Do you have the custody of the records of the corporation, or aire the records in tie custo(ly of its secretary?
Mr. LAZAIMS. I do not have it with me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand that.
Mr. LAZARUS. I do not have the recordsMAr. Are the records subject to your control?
Mr. LAZARUS. No.
Mr. TAVENE J. Then I will Iave to ask that you tell us who the secretary of the corporation is.
Mr. LAzARuS. I will have to answer you that I do not desire to name names before this committee. As I said, I have sat hcre the last few days and I have seen with my own eyes something that was a little bit repulsive to meMr. TAVENNER. Your answer is not responsive to my question.
Mr. LAZARUs. I am sorry, Mr. Tavenner. This is absolutely my answer. It has to be, because I have drawn certain conclusions from the meeting, from this forum, which makes me do things that I probably did not think of before. I think I have a perfect right to explain to you why I don't want to mention any names. And I am doing that. I am trying to tell you that I don't want to mention any names liecause this committee is only interested in naming names to blacklist these people.
Mr. Vumnn. Mr. Lazarus, the committee will listen to any reasons you have based upon logical, legal grounds for your refusal to answer. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. VELDE. But we don't care to listen to any lecture or any voluntary statements like you have been making. I direct you to answer the question that was asked of you by counsel. If you don't remember it, I will ask him to rephrase it or have the reporter read it t6 you.
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Velde, I haven't given you the reasons yet, all the reasons. I think I am entitled to have the privilege of addressing to you, as much as the other witnesses did. And I think you have left witnesses here talking to you for hours, with repeats. However, they did, and you let them, while I want to explain my reasons and you refuse.
Mr. VELD. If you will answer the question, Mr. Lazarus, we would probably give you the privilege of talking to us.
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Velde I-am explaining to you why I don't want to answer this question. I have a perfect right to explain the reasons. 31747-53--pt 2-4 482 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIE8 IN T118 1,014 ANOIEhtA AIRRA I want the American people to know, I am in front of television and I alll lit front of radio.

Mr. Doyas. I feel as it member of this conittee, I want to sincerely counter youir charge that this committee is Inteested In blacklisting vI)ople. That is absolutely false. As a member of this committee, want you to understand that I am not interested in anyone being blacklisted unless they are tmbvoesive and intend to unlawfully overthrow my Government. (At this point Mr.LaIzarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. DoYLE. Those are the kind of people we are trying to discover . Are you a member of the Commanunist Party now V
Mr. LAzAnus. Now, Mr. Congressman, I have been|aiusinessinan for 37 years. I hmve been a good citizen in this conununit y for :17 years. I have not committed any crimes. I have made nothing but friends.
Mr. 1)oyiax. We don't say you have committed any crimes, hut I am asking you if you are a member of the Communist Part, flowI
Mr. LAZARus. Let me answo you 11thO way I feel lik answering. I have answered this question in front of other forums all over the country. I have made statements all over the country about my political affiliations. However, I refuse to make my political affliations In front of you, to tell you, for it reason, and this is tie season, my friend: If I tell oil what you wallet, to tell yoll-alld I have, to tell time tr-t10h, a11d _would be a very nice fellow, I would not he called any names, because I ain not the kind of fellow that you think I am. However if I say it ill front of this audience today, and tomorrow and 6 months froni now, and a year from iow, somebody would drag lme into court and state that I have perjured myself, anld then I have to go to court and I have to be dragged in. And at, my age, Con- gressman, I don't think I should do that, that you should ask me to do that.
Mr. DoYLe. We are not asking you to perjure yourself. We are asing )oil to tell the truth. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.) 
Mr. CLA-DY. MAr. Chairman, I suggest that counsel propound his question again so that we may get back to that.
Mr. Lz, RUs. By the wayMr. ChArDY. Just a moment, sir. I made a request of te chairman.
Mr. VamE. Will counsel propound his last. question?
Mr. TAVE.NzNE. The question, Mr. Lazarus, is this: Will you please advise the committee as to who the secretary of your corporation is at the present time?
Mr. LAzARus. I didn't hear the question.
Mr. TAVENNEXR. Will you please advise.the committee of the name of the secretary of your corporation, that is, the corporation of which you are the sole stockholder?
Mr. JACKSON. The Independent Productions Corp.
Mr. TAvENNER. The Independent Productions Corp. at the present time. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Tavenner, I refuse to answer this on the grounds that I propounded to you before, and I refuse it relying on tle Constitution of the United States, on the first amendment, and all of the amendments, especially the fifth amendment. COMMUNIST A'fIVITIES IN TIHA LOS ANGEL S ARIEA 483

I want to answer it in the same mantmr as I answered the other question, namely, that I am absolutely relying on the Constitution of the United States and on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. CLARDI. You mean you are refusing to answer on those grounds?
Mr. LAZAIMU. Yes, sir; on those grounds.
Mr. C1,AIDY. Would it be fair to say, then, that tany question we might ask you concerning the personnel connected with the corporation will be answered in tile sae way? That will shorten it up.
Mr. LAZARUS. Concerning the personnel, yes, sir; yes, sir..I would like to talk to you anything you w'ant about my personal affair in the corporation, of whic h I u1e. very proud. Now, if you desire to talk
Mr. LAZA1R11s. Before I answer yor question, I Woui(ld HIM to to me about the corporation from my standpoint, from my understanding, I will gladly answer your every question. But I will not nlntion any names. 
Mr. WATER. How did you become president of the corporation?
Mr. LAZARUs. I became president of the corporation a year and a half or 2 years ago when I decided to go into the business of producing pictures. M r. AWVrTR. How did you become president?
Mr. LAxzARUs. I became president because I was the initiator of the thing, I was tho first investor in this corporation, and therefore I became the )resident.
Mr. WALTER. That isn't an answer to my question. Who nominated you for president?
Mr. LAZARUS. Tle original directors.
Mr. WALTER. Who were they ?
Mr. LAZARUS. I can't mention any names.
Mr. WALTER. Well now, if you had all of the stock, how could there have been other directors?
Mr. 'LAZARUS. Yes, we did. Originally, the corporation, I imagille(At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. My attorney tells me that the laws of California do not require a stockholder to be a director, or a director to be a stockholder.

Mr. Jlloyixp. AMr. lUt'/artan1 I am assmnning in tasking you this question that you, apparently b~etng the onl stockholder to put any money into theo corporation, thtyo or amiliar with the script which wti8 going to be used in the production of this play. Now, fain not asking you again who wrote the script, because it apparently wol besees. 'Mr. LAZARUS. Yes. I think Mir. Doyle, you know the name. You know the name, why do you ask me?
Mr. DOYLE. 'rhaiks for giving me credit for knowing everything Mir. LAZARUS. I read the book.- I read the script. I wits very mileh in love with the script. Mir. DoyLE. Good. Were you familiar also with the names of any of the chief participants to be in the cast? Don't misunderstand me. I am not asking you nor I am not going to ask you the names of any 494 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA of the members of the cast. But when your corporation made this deal with the Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers outfit, were you then familiar with or prior thereto were you familiar with the names of any or all of the leading figures to be in the cast ?
Mr. LAZARUS. I was not familiar with any names of the cast.
Mr. DoYLE. All right. Thank you.
Mr. VnWE. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. Xo questions. 
Mr. V ni:t.Mr. Counsel, is there anything more?
Mr. TAVENNm. Yes sir; I think there is another question.
Mr. Lazarus I understood you to say in the early part of your testimony, I beheve you said you would not reveal the address ofthe office of your corporation. Did I understand you correctly or not?
Mr. LAZARUS. I really don't know the address of the corporation today, what address, it any, it does have. Originally it was my address. It was the address of my home when I first incorporated. It was 1250 Beverly Estate Drive, and then when I moved to different places I have changed the address to where I moved to.
Mr. TAvENNER.-What was the address of the office in September of 1951?
Mr. LAZARUS. I don't recollect September 1051.
Mr. TAVENNER. You don't recollect?
Mr. LAZARUS. I suppose you know it. It is in front of you. Will you please tell me, ask me the address and I will tell you whether it is correct or not? 
Mr. TAVENNER. All right, sir. I will try to refresh your recollection. I hand you what purports to be photostatic copies of the bank statement for your corporation covering the period from September 21 of 1951, to January 30, 1952, and ask that they be marked also as Lazarus' exhibit No. 6 for identification. (The document referred to was marked "Lazarus' Exhibit No. 6" for identification.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I will ask you to examine the name of the account and see whether or not the address of the account appears-I mean the address of the company appears as part of the account. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. TAVENNER. May the record show flat ttose papers constitute Lazarus' exhibit No. 6 for identification onlyI (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. The address is the attorney's address, the attorneys of the corporation address.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is that address?
Mr. LAZARUS. It is 709, I think, Rives Strong Building, Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was that the address of your corporationI
Mr. LAZARUS. No that was the address of the attorneys.
Mr. TAVENNER. *hy did you give the bank the address of your attorney for your account, instead of your own company's address?
Mr. LAzARus. I really don't remember what was the reason at that" particular time." (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. I know that I was at that time in the process of moving from one place to the other. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THI LOS ANGLES AREA 495 
Mr. TAVENNER. It took quite long to move, from September 1,1951, to February 1052.
Mr. LAZARUS. I left it there from the first time we opened the account, we left the address there. We did not use it and the bank was at that time right across the street from me, the Union Bank, located on Eighth Street.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Tavenner, I might say tis: As a member of the California bar I know that it is quite the practice where there was a corporation such as this, owned entirely by one person, it is quite a usual thing for the official office of the corporation to be the office of legal counsel. It is not unusual at all.
Mr. 'VAVEN-4ER. I have no further questions.
Mr. Scif:mtx. Mr. Lazarus, I have in my hand a certified copy by the secretary of state of the State of California of the articles of incorporation of the Independent Producers Corp. I would like to have the witness look at this and identify it as the articles of incorporation of his corporation.
Mr. TAVENNER. I suggest that the photostatic copy be marked Lazarus' exhibit No. 7 for identification only. ' (The document referredto was marked "Lazarus' Exhibit No. 7" for identification.)
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Congressman there are other haines on the document presented to me, and therefore I will refuse to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCIEmtER. I haven't asked you about names; I am merely asking you whether that is a copy, a certified copy of the articles of incorporation of your corporation.
Mr. CLAnnY. Before you answer, turn it over and look at the certification on the back.
Mr. SuiEmtm. The certification is right on the front.
Mr. CLAnDY. There is a certification on the back.
Mr. LAZARUS. Gentlemen, I think you are not looking for any information. This information is right in front of you. Why do you want me to answer this, which is it certified copy of the franchise of the State of California Do you need additional information from me?
Mr. SCHERER. Yes, very much so.
Mr. LAZARUS. I am not going to give it to you on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JAcXsoN. Mr. Chairman, that is obviously an abuse of the privilege. I ask that the witness be directed to answer whether or not that is a copy of the articles of incorporation.
Mr. VELDE. Yes, the Chair feels that that is a perfectly legitimate question and can be answered.
Mr. JACKSON. The constitutional amendment can be stretched just so far.
Mr. VEE. Therefore I direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MAROOLIS, May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman? If he answers that question will it be considered a waiver with respect to any of the names that appear thereon?
Mr. CQARDY. What?
Mr. MARGOLIS. Will it be considered a waiver of his rights with respect to any of the names that appear on the documents 400 COMMUNIWt' AVIIII $IN TH 1.09~ ANGUtL141 AIIUA Oi tl111 lel, io lilts to know ill ordor ito ktnow Whether 110 t'malit jprivitt'go.

But there were two so-called professional Comnmunists who sometimes attended our meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were they?
Mr. HvioN. A woman named Jane Wallace, I think.
Mr. TAv'NNE. Do you know whether that was her party name or her actual namely
Mr. HUaNDON. I ani not sure whether it was Jane Wallace or it was Jane Wilson, and I don't know which was which; Jane Wallace or Jane Wilson.
Mr. CiARDY. If he can identify her any furtherMr. TAVENNFJt. Can you give us any further identifying informationMr. HrINI*DON. Other than the name, no.
Mr. TAVE.NNER. Of the individual?
Mr. HFRNDON. Of the individual?
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether the individual was a fulltime employee of the communist Party or whether the person had some other occupation ?
Mr. HERNDON. I understood she was a full-time employee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall the name of the second person ?
Mr. HERNDON. Anne-I got her mixed up with someone else, now.
Mr. CLARDY. Perhaps he had better give it a little more thought.
Mr. TAVENNER. Possibly you should wait and see if the name occurs to you later in the course of your testimony.
Mr. CLARDY. I would rather we didn't get anything unless he is stlle. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. I think if you are not sure abouta name you should not suggest that it was possibly so and so. We want only your very positive and distinct recollection. I want to read to you and make a )al't of the record some things that were said about the teachers and the teaching profession in the Communist Party literature as a basis for asking you additional questions. In volume 23 of Lenin, at page 499, there appears this statement: Today the chief task of those members of the teaching profession who have taken their stand with the International and the Soviet Government is to work for the creation of a wider and, as nearly as possible, an all.embracing teachers' union. Of course, Stalin at that time was writing in Russia and he was writing on the subject generally. Again at page 500, Lenin has this to say: Your union should now become a broad teachers' trade unlon embracing vast numbers; a union which will resolutely take up its stand on the Soviet platform and the struggle for socialism by means of a dictatorship of the proletariat. Do you recall whether that part of Lenin was actually discussed in your special group within the teachers' group?
Mr. HERNDON. I don't recognize either of those quotations as having heard them before.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like also to read you a paragraph from Toward Soviet America by William Z. Foster, printed in 1932, relating to the subject of education. He said: Among the elementary measures the American Soviet Government will adopt to further the cultural revolution are the following: (COMMUNST 'ACTIVITIES IN THE ,08 ANOELES AREA 5, The schools, college, and universities will be coordinated and grouped underthe National Department of Education and Its State and local branches, The studies will be revolutionized, being cleansed of religious, patriotic, au other features of the bourgeois Ideoloy. The students will be taught on the basis of Marxian dialectical materalim, InternationalIsin, and the general ethics of the now Socialist society, 'resent obsolete methods of teaching will be superseded by a scientific pedagogy. Religious schools will be abolished. Do you recall that portion of Foster's volume on Toward Soviet America having been read or discussed in your meetingsI fNDON. I reliember the title of the book, as we were recomMir. I1 mended to read it, and I evidently never read it because I don't re- member that passage. 
Mr. TAVENN:R. Were you informed by higher functionaries of the Conunmunist Party fully aIs to what the Communist Party intended to accomplish by infiltration into the teachers' groups?
Mr. IEIINION. No, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNERI. In this connection I want. to read you an excerpt from the Communist, an organ commonly referred to as an organ of the Communist Party, of May 1937, entitled "The School and the People's Front," by Richard #rank. Richard Frank was it member of the education cotiilission of the Young Communist League. He had this to say: The task of the Communist Party must be first and foremost to arouse the teachers to class congclousness and to organize them Into the aerican Federation of Teachers, which Is the ain current of the American labor government. In the effort to organize the teachers every care must btt taken to bring together in united front actions all existing teachers' organizations. Especlal attention must be paid to secure such action with the American Association of University Professors, the National Education Association anl the Guild. Our party members in theow organizations inust work actively toward that end. Well, do you recall those purposes or objectives of the Communist Party being disctlsed at your meetingsI
Mr. HERNDON. 'T'he part you read about increasing working-class consciousness among teachers, yes, that sort of thing. The influence on the teachers' unit of tle Communist Party at the time I was in it seemed to be not based on any broad general philosophy, but on, rather, week-by-week or month-by-montIt piecemeal actions in favor of this, that or the other.
Mr. TAVENNF.R. Now, yon have stated that 1 of the principal objectives 1 of the 2 principal objectives, as you understood it, of your particular group of the Communist Patty was to control the policies of the teachers' local.
Mr. HINDON. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNm. Did that include also the ability to take over the organization and influence it generally?
Mr. HEtNrNoD . By "take over the organization," we did not want to have a complete sltte of officers, for instance, who were Communists. We had the secretary of the union during the time I was there, and sie was a Communist. I think she was perhaps the only member of the governing hoard who was a Communist, But that, you see, was the contact and the in for the Communist Party. We didn't want to head it. The Communists didn't want to head it. They wanted to have people who were not possibly compromised running it for them, and they would pull the wires Iehind the 808 cOIMMUNIFs ACTIVITIER N TJTH LOR ANOELE8 ARNA, dewno. Dbmilnatlon in that sense, yes, but not by electing a complete slate of officers.
Mr. TAVyHNr.R. Now, the Teachers' Union was composed of many teachers who were not in any sense members of the Communist Party or even sympathetic to the Communist Party, is thnt right?
Mr. 1IF'tNDON. I myself had Joined it in4acramento in 1029, praetically before I heard of the Communist Party, on its own merits. 'Mr. 'rAVPNNVR. How many people were members of Local 430 of the Teacher's Union I
Mr. 14titmnox. I do not know.
Mr. TAVNERin. Can you give us a general idea I
Mr. HrINDoN. The membership must have been much larger than the attendance at meetings. At meetings we would have 150 or 200 members, perhaps.
Mr. CI IDY. How frequent were those meetingsI
Mr. HEUNnOx. I believe once a month.
Mr. CIJRDY. That was about the average attendance? 
Mr. HuaNnoz. One hundred and fifty members average.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many members were there in this Communist Party unit which was seeking to exert its influence on the union? Mi. Hatr oN. Eight, ten, twelve.
Mr. CLARDY. Of course, the 8, 10, or 12 were a cohesive unit with a definite objective, so you were able to sell your ideas to those at least wito just at random differed on particular subjects? .Mr. H.RNDON. Exactly yes, because the Communist Party acted as a unit, frequently would dissolve its meeting, the formal meeting, and reconvene as a fraction of the teachers' units to discuss what was com- ing up, to plan motions and seconds to motions, and so on, and plan just what route would be followed in case anything unforeseen came up, and we could call the party caucus iu- advance of the executive board of the union. We caucus4d before the executive board and also we caucused in advance of the general membership meetings.
Mr. CLARDY. So at the meeting you had all your moves planned both for the executive committee and for the membership meetings. . Mr. HEnNDoN. The Communists came early, stayed late, and volunteered for the dirty jobs.
Mr. CLARDY. And outshouted the rest of them when that became necessary, I take it?
Mr. HnNDoIm. If necessary.
Mr. TAVENwNE. Did this type of activity continue during the entire eriod of your membership in the teachers' unit of the Communist Party?
Mr. HERmoN. Yes. 
Mr TAvENnR Would you state to the committee, please, whether in your judgment your Communist Party unit was fairly successful in its endeavors in connection with the Teachers' Union?
Mr. Emunw. It was very successful in its endeavors. We were careful not to try anything too raw, so we would try only things which were slightly raw', because if we tried anything too raw we would have been slapped down by the membership at large.
Mr. Climy. I take it you really never lost out on an important issue that you wanted to raise?
Mr. HnNDoN. Not that I can remember. My memory is quite vague on specific issues at this distance. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANOn:LES AREA 509 
Mr. CtAnDy. I would Imagine it would be.
Mr TAVENNER Can You recall any particular instance when the Communist unit set about a deliberate plan to cause the Teachers' Union to follow its leadership in any outstanding matter?
Mr. IHENDON. Not specifically.
Mr. TAvxNNYR. Do you know whether or not the Communist Party endeavored, to your knowledge, to have the Teachers' Union adopt resolutions that related to matters outside of its own immediate sphere of operations, slci us on international questions or foreign policies of the Government ommatte,'s of that kind as to which the Communist 6 Party line changed from time to time?
Mr. HERNDON. I can remember telegrams, for Instance, being authorized by the resolutions of the membership on matters of housing, on matters-on Spain, also, on which the Communist Party line of the moment was followed.
Mr. TAVENNERI. Were such matters endorsed and approved at your meetings of the Communist Party members, which were held prior to the meetings of the Teachers' Union f
Mr. HERINDON. 'They were and that was pursuant to instructions from above, which would frequently come in the form of directives in the Communist newspapers, that all Communist organizations should get the non-Communist organizations with which they were affiliated to further certain policies of the party nationally.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall any instance in which they took a position with respect to the foreign policy of this country or the Soviet Union I
Mr. HERNDON. I cannot.
Mr. TAvENN~EJ. Can you give us the names of the schools or institutions which were represented in this Communist unit of the professional units of the Communist Part ?
Mr. HERNDON. I wouldn't say the schools were represented. There was a member from the City ollege of Los Angeles. There was a . . A member from the junior high schools.
Mr. TAVENNER. I think possibly at this time it would be well to identify, if he can, who the member or members were from the various sclool..
Mr. HERNDON. There was a man named Norman Byrne from the City College. There was a high school, a junior high school in North Hollywood I do not know the name of the high school. The teacher's name was ilarry Shepro. Roosevelt High Sclool, there was a teacher named Rose P-o-s-e-l-l. And Lewis and myself from Glendale College. rvENNE. What was Lewis' first name?
Mr. T
Mr. HERNDoN. Richard Byrd Lewis.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he have a nickname or a pseudonym?
Mr. HNoN. Dick was his nickname.
Mr. TAvxzN1;. Can you recall the names of other persons from other institutions?
Mr. HEIINDON. Those are the only names whose schools I can remember at this time. I may never have known the schools these people were from. We were very secretive with one another and very secretive within the party as to the other units. I didn't know, for instance, of certain knowledge what other professional units there were besides 510 COMMUNIST ACVIRLIS IN TIM LOS ANGELES ARFIA teaching. I know there were others, I can't say(eertainly what ntiher there were. 
Mr. CLARDY. Each cell was more or less hermetically salmed agaitist the rest. 
Mr. HzRNDON. At that time, yes.
Mr. ToAVmNNiEP. We have learned in the course of these hearing from the testimony of Mr. Ashe that the purpose of forming tie -professional cells, was to give the members of the profemions a type of security which other persons in the Coniunnst Party (lid not eniov. 
Mr. HxMoI. Exactly. 
Mr. 'T'AVEaa415. Now, were most of the members in that group members of the Teachers' Union Local 480? 
Mr. HyENDoN. All of them who were in teaching were, I believe.
Mr. TAVENRP.V. But there were some persolis it your group who were not teachersI
Mr. HUNDoN. There were some people whose status was-there was the wife of one there. I am not sure whether slit, was o over had been a teacher.
Mr. TAv;rR. What was her nameI
Mr. HEnNDox. Anna Shepro. Site was a ntember for a short time and dropped out.
Mr. TAVENNzR. Do you recall how many locals of the Teachers' Union there were in the State of California at that time?
Mr. HERNDON. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You know there were others.
Mr. H NsvoN. There were others. I was a charter member of the local which was formed in Glendale and Burbank, which never amounted to much, died of lack of interest, and that was born on orders from the party.
Mr. CLARDY. From whom did the orders come?
Mr. HRNDoN. I don't know, sir, and I don't suppose we were encouraged to ask these questions. As I remember At, r didn't ask many questions.
Mr. CLARDY. You mean someone in your own local group just advised the group that he had orders from higher up to set up this proram and you all blindly followed through?
Mr. HERoto. That is about it.
Mr. CLARDY. Who was the secretary of your group?
Mr. HraNDoN. They changed at various times. The idea was more -or less to rotate the officers. I cannot remember anyone who was secretary. . Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us the names of other persons in your group who may not have been teachers at the time You gave us the wife of Mr. Shepro as one. Now, were there others that you can recall?
Mr. Hz DON. Another wife of another member, and I am not sure whether she is a teacher or not or whether she merely attended our meetings because of family convenience.
Mr. TAwsN. Well, just a moment. If it is a mere matter of family convenience, I don't believe I will ask you any questions, unless you are certain she was a member of your group.
Mr. immWoN. I could not be that certain oTit. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THR 1LOS ANGELES AREA 511 
Mr. TAVNNPR. Were you acquainted with a person by the name of Jane HoweI
Mr. HEENnoN, Jane Howe is the name that I remembered as Anne. It is not Anne. It is Jane Howe. That was the name I couldn't remember a minute ago.
Mr. TAVPNNPR. Do you know whether she went by another name, used another name also?
Mr. IlF.RNDoN. Site did, but I can't be sure what it was. 
Mr. TAVE~NNER. Was it Anne Kinney? 
Mr. HnNDON. I believe it was. I believe it was.
Mr. TAVENNE.R. Well, Anne Kinney has testified before the committee in executive session, and has admitted her membership in the Communist Party. In fact, she testified that she was at one time a Socialist, and that there was a Communist Party unit organized within the Socialist Party of which she was a member, and Mr. Ashe, who was one of the early witness in this hearing, was also a member and who had testified to it. She also testified how she was assigned to this particular unit, your unit of the Teachers' Union, and that she left the party, I believe in October of 1045, and has not been a member of the party since. Now, she further testified that she was on a committee which had the job of disciplining members of the Communist Party where occasion for such a thing existed. Do you know anything about that? Do you know anything about discipline that was exercised within the Communist Party by a committee? * Mr. HERNDON. Only by hearsay. I heard that there were disciplinary committees which were supposed to be very fierce organizations, but there were no disciplinary cases in regard to anyone whom I knew while I was in the party.
Mr. CLARDY. You yourself were never disciplined by the party?
Mr. HERNDON. No formal reprimands after a formal hearing or anything of the sort. There was a good deal of self-criticism and informal slapping down of members who were slack in any way. At my first party meeting I was too frightened. I was told to stand up on my feet and give a 8-minute speech on why it was important not to come 2 minutes late. I came in 2 minutes after 8 or whatever it was. - I suppose you would call that informal discipline. (Representative Donald L. Jackson reentered the hearing room at this point, 11 a. m.)
Mr. JAocKSON. Did your group of the Communist Party endeavor to exercise its influence over the Teachers' Union to the extent of con.trolling the delegates from the teachers' local to the State or National conventions which it had?
Mr. HzitNuoN. I imagine so, but I can't say so of certain knowledge.
Mr. JAcKSON. Did you ever attend the State or National convention as a delegate?
Mr. HER roN. No sir.
Mr. TAvENNER. Did you ever attend a fraction meeting of the Communist Party?
Mr. HzRNwoN. I attended what was called the State fraction meeting, which was held in San Luis Obispo, I don't know when, and I don't know where it was. I think I know who I went with.

That fall I went back rather sporadically, becoming more and more disgusted with the whole thing, and when Staliti invaded Finland I gave up. I went away and didn't come back. I had decided by that tite-what I had joined was supposed to be the teachers' unit of tie h1ollywood professional section of the Comnunist Party of the United lstates, aid I decided finally that I had more than enough evidence to l)etplsuide tie that the so-called Com,nunist Party of tile Unitd States was absolutely nothing more nor less than a tool of the Soviet foreign policy, of Russian foreign policy, and I didn't. want any part of it.
Mr. TAV.NX.r. Aid as a result you made the decision to get out of it and to stay outI
Mr. HMF.X4(. Yes. I should have done it sooner, of course. I had heard all sorts of tales of disciplinary committees and goon squads and I thought someone would (rive up beside me and finish me off, perhaps. Actually, I really had nothing to fear.

Mr. HEmNNo. He became a member after I entered, and he was still In when I left. His wife, Libby Minkus, who, I believe, was not a teficher and myself, and Richard Byrd Lewis, no relation to the Matilda Lewis. Matilda Lewis, by the way, did not come to meetings for more than a short while. She may have left the party or been transferred, 1 am not sure which, before I left.
Mr. TAVzr;1ER. Now, you have told us that you were'sent on a mission to another area to attempt to revive t Coimnunist Party group which was beginning to weaken.
Mr. HERNDON. Yes.
Mr. TAVENln. Where was that?
Mr. HEENDoN. That was in Pasadena and it was a mixed group.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by "mixed group"?
Mr. HEUNDON. Not one profession. In fact, not even entirely professional.
Mr. TAvENNER. Do you remember how many members there were?
Mr. HERzDoN. Well, including the 2 of us who were sent there, 10.
Mr. TAVENNFR. Who were the 8 members who were originally members of that group, before you went over?
Mr. HE NDON. I can remember only 2 names, a man and his wife. At his home we met. I don't know what they did, now. Another man and his wife. The man, I believe, was a dentist. A man who was an instructor.
Mr. TAVENNE. Let me ask you, are you positive of the names of the individualsMr. HERNDON. I cannot--haven't the faintest recollection of the names of those four. And I have attempted to remember.

Mr. TAVENNFR. Can you fix the approximate time when that occurred I
Mr. IIpRfNDON. It was before Christmas, before the end of the year, in 1940.
Mr. 'TAVENNER. Now, Mr. Herndon, the committee is very much concerned about the situation that may exist where a teacher at the present timie who is subject to the discipline of the Communist Party may be actively engaged in teaching in a school. Now I would like to know from you, from your own experience and from your knowledge of the objectives of the Communist Party and its operation, what you have to say from your own standpoint as to the advisability of a teacher being permitted to teach young students, particularly where the teacher is subject to the directives of the Communist Party and its discipline.
Mr. HEpRtoN. Th1at brings up the question of academic freedom$ and my conception of academic freedom is that a teacher should teach his subject and good citizenship and good character along with it, to the best oi his ability, that he should use his intelligence and teach the truth as far as he can see it, and that his teaching should be in accordance with his conscience. Now, a teacher who is in the Communist Party is not a free agent. No matter how intelligent he may be, when he enters the party he ISee p. 521 for correction; name should be Sidney Welnbaum. 518 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THM 1,01 AN, ELR AIMA agrrees to accept tie direction of the Communist Party as to what he should think, when he should think it, without demlt a1d without a why. He is not it free agent Intellectually, and he is not a free agent morally. I don't see how, realy-I have come to the conclusion that with t practicing Communist I don't see how it can be a question of academic freedom at. all. I think that a teacher who Is at. the present tine, let us sty a practicing Conmntist is a person' who is under the direction of the Conintunist Party to teach not the truth as he sees it, but tile truth as the Comnuuunist Party sees it, as far as possible. 
Mr. ScitrIn, May I intert'upt, Mr. Chairman and counsel?
Mr. Scherer.
Mr. S'ot sn. Professor, from yoir experience, do you feel that a

Mr. HUtNDoW. I don't see how ho Can stay in).
Mr. S0llm.R.Rs. I think ptrhniips you might ajlree with Lewis Webstor Jones, who is tie president of Rutgers Utiversity. Rutgors lini. varsity is one of the best universities In this country. Unfortunately tile university had to aet within the hlst few molnilis to remove from tile faculty a number of its members. In connection with the removal of those mellbes, the president of Rttgers adeIlia a statement, which has been reduced to pamphlet formn wud which is entitled "Academic Freodom and Civic Rospon4.ibility." In the past the committee has, as you perliaps know, been attacked front various sources by prominent educators onl tile ground that, by investigating pensons who are engaged in Communist activities in the teaching profession we are interfering with academic freedom. it) that connection I think it. would be well, Mr. Chairman, to ask this witnem if lie agrees in the conclusions drawn by 1President Jones of Rut ers. I just have 2 or 3 paragraphs which are along the lines which you have just testified. Tile president says it his statement, first: Tie legil right of tiny citizen to refuse to testify on the grounds of possible self-lncrimination as provided unter the fifth aiendinent is not In dispute, though th legal as well tip the mortl wisdom of exercising it Is open to serious doubt. And then he continues: The Commnunist Party i not a isilitleal party like any other. It is a secret conspiratorial orgnnizatiou Inmosing on Its nmenibers a disellilne anti reginen- tfition of thought quite alien to the normill political parties of i democracy, Its standards of ethics are radically different from the ethical principles on which lit it free society freedoitof thought, freedom of reseaureh nid of teaching are based. The university must isist on tolerance of honestly held and frankly lproclaimed differences of opinion, and its facility must be free to engage In ordinary ol~en political activity, lint it mnst protect Itself and cooperate in protecting the (ittntry against tty consplity whihb, if steessful, would destroy that freedom. It Is unreasonable to deny that there is a real danger of Oommu. nist aubvershon or to dlstism all public concern with Communist activity as hysteria. The public has the right, through its legally constituted representa. ties, to Inquire Into the communist Party membership of Individuals. Public Investigation of the universities iN legitimate anl should be frankly met. It Implies no Invasion of academic freedom. COMMIINIW' ACTIVITIEF.

Now, from your experience, would vou eone(, ll ite stantllientS ma(le by tihe president of Rutgers Uniiveri with reference to this subject and the subject about which you have just been testifying I
Mr. Hmrmyolm. I took notes as you were reading, and I think I can agree with the president of Rutgers oti all of his points. M. JACKSON. I think in that connection Rultgers is a long way off in point of miles, but within the past few days the heads of the great California institutions, the University of California, Dr. Sproul; the University of California at Los Angeles, Dr. Allen; and tile president of Stanford University up nort h, have all joined in eff&et in the position taken by )r. IAwis Webster Jones, and it is v matter of great sttisfaction to me and to my colleague from Califii,ia, Mr. Do,e)to know that, these university presidents have takLn that poasition with respect to the necessity for finding out where Communists are in their elhools and eXposing them. Ar. CIr.Aiw. [ think it ought to 1)e noted, Mr. C chairman, that while we had some witiesses before us front the faculty of Rutlgers, the president aid the entire school dlininistration cOolerated ,. percent with its and eXlressed satisfaclion with our motive and with the results of our investigation.
Mr. JACKSON. Yes. I should also point out that the same is true also of Ohio State University, Temple University, and Harvard University.
Mr. Scunavitt. Mr. Chairman, may 1 make a farther observation in connection with that statement, particularly with reference to Ohio State University I In the mail this morning I received at newspaper artieh, from the Cincinnati Enquirer concerning Dr. Boris' action with reference to Prof. Byron '. Darling, who testified before this committee in Waslhington just a few weeks ago or as Mr. Clardy stys refused to testify, wich is perhaps more in lille with the truth. And in view of the fact that we are on this subject now and in view of the fact that Profemor Ilevis ha83iust spoken oil that, I believe that what lie said should be at least ill ided in the record at this point, for the benefit of those who are here today at this point. For the benefit of those who are here today, Prof. Byron T. Darlin is an ontstandin r profesor at Ohio State University.

Mr. Hxno. . it depends upon how manil- opportunities tile teacher has to put forth thle Communist line. Naturally, some teachers in certain subjects and on ceirain levels would have many more opportunities than other teachers.
Mr. Doxrm. Well, we grant that, but is a member of tile Communist Party, who happens to teach in the California ubhie schools, in your judgment taking the opportunity to teach tile ommunist line as far as he can? Is flint his obligation?
Mr. HErfDmo. The obligation is to take opportunities to teach the Communist Party line as fir as lie can without destroying his usefulness and exposing himself too obviously.

Mr. HERNtooN. That is a photograph of the mail I knew as Sidney Weinbaum. 522 OMMUZOST' AMVoIrr1s 'IN THE 1O08 ANGELES 'AREA ' Mr. TAVzNNi I want to call to your attention one further excerpt from the article written by Richard Frank and entitled "The School and the People's Front," which appeared in the Communist of May 1937. This statement was made: To enable the teachers and the party to do the latter-- and by "latter" was meant to furnish to the students working class education. the party must take careful steps to see that all teacher comrades are given thorough education in tle teachings of Marxism and Leninism. Did you consider that instruction was being carried out in your tell that you were being given teachings in Marxism and Leninism? M~r. HERNDON. I considered tlat that was a party ideal. I do not think that in my time in the party it was thoroughly carried out.
Mr. TAVENNEIt, And continuing to read.: Only when teachers have really mastered Marxism and Leninism will they be able skillfully to inject it Into their teachings at the least risk of exposure, and at the same time to conduct struggles around the schools in a truly Bolshevik manner. Such teachers can also be used to advantage to conduct classes in Marxism, Leninism, for workers generally, and many such teachers should be assigned not to school units, but to factory or Industrial units where they can have great aid In party education, In helping with leaflets, shop papers, and so forth. Others can play an important role In the educational activities of the Young Communist League. Now, I have during the course of your testimony asked you various questions to indicate to what extent those very objectives were being carried out or fostered in your group. If you have anything further to say about it, I will be glad to hear it.
Mr. H nDoN. That is the Communist of May 1937?
Mr. TAvENNER. Yes; 
Mr. HERNDON. Well, I joined late in the fall of 1937, and at that time, as I said this mornmg, the policy of the party was to keep the teachers in a teacher unit, for instance, and not put them out one by one, scatter them out in shop and factory unit.
Mr. TAvNNER. I find, also, this interesting paragraph in Mr. Frank's article: . In rural communities teachers who are among the few educated people are looked up to with tremendous respect, they are in a position to become community leaders. As a means of mobilizing the people In the villages and the countryside, steps should be taken to try to send Communist teachers Into rural com. inunities where they should become active in all community organizations.
Mr. HEnwoN. May I say something on that?
Mr. TAvENiaR. Yes, sir. 
Mr. HERNDoN. It sounds as if it might be a translation from-that doesn't sound like an American rural community to me. It sounds like a translation from something written for some other country.
Mr. TAvExNn. Well, that was contained in the article appearing in the Communist of May 1937, entitled "The Schools and the peoples Front" by Richard Frank, who, as I have stated before was a member of the education committee of the Young Communist League.
Mr. HnsiXoi. Of the United StatesI 
Mr. TAYvNNERt. Of the United States. That apparently is one of the basic and -that indicates something of the basic and underlying policies of the Communist Party, and-of course we are COBMNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANOELES AREA 523 interested to know how or to what extent it was translated into the activities of your particular group, if at all.
Mr, HENDON. I work in a rather highly literate community in which a good niany people think they are just as smart as the teachers, so I donPt think there was too much application in my particular case, nor in the case of the teachers unit in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAvENNER. You saw no indication of any planned effort to be certain that the teachers who went into the ru'al areas were Communist teachers?
Mr. HERNDOO. I had no contact with teachers in rural areas.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, near the close of the morning session a state. ment was made and a statement was also read Into the record regardihg the attitude of the president of Rutgers University on the general subject of Communist activities aniong teachers, w ow, when you received your subponm to appear before this committee, did you report It to your superiors?
Mr. HEiRN. I reported it to the president of the board of education. In fact, I had spoken to him told him that I might, I thought, receive a subpena, before I received it.
Mr. TAVENNER. What; was the general attitude of your superiors as to your appearance here and your divulgence of the fact that you had formerly been a member of the party?
Mr. HEINDON. Well, I shoul say that their first concern probably was-I am inferring this-that their first concern probably was the welfare of the school system as a whole. I think that was their first concern.
Mr. TAVENNER. Speak a little louder, please.
Mr. HERNDON. Aside from that, the school board was interested in knowing when I joined the party, how long I had been in the party, why I had gotten in in the first place, and why I had gotten out. I think that is about the substance.
Mr. TAvENNER. And did you make a full disclosure to them of what your prior activities had been
Mr. H-INDOX. I did. I made a statement for them and answered to the best of my ability any questions they had.
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of your good faith in coming forward and telling what you know or being willing to tell what you know about the Communist Party, I understand your position with your teaching institution is satisfactory ?
Mr. HEnNDON. The administration has been helpful and friendly.
Mr. ScJERER. I think the committee would feel that the administration should be helpful and friendly, and not invoke any sanctions of any kind whatsoever against the professor.
Mr. TAvENNEr. As the members of the committee well know, that has been the way in which this type of information has been received and acted upon by a number of other institutions. Smith College is one that I have in mind.
Mr. ScHERER. yes, sir. I think we would even recommend that, if it was in our province to do so in this instance, don't you, Mr. Clardy?
Mr. CP.AnDr. Definitely.
Mr. TAvENNER. In other words, a citizen's effort to be truthful and fair in a serious matter of this kind is a patriotic duty.
Mr. CLARDY. That is the way every member of the committee regards it Mr. Counsel, and I want to express that to you, Mr. Witness, 824 COMMUNIST ACYVIVITIII IN-INA~A01 -ANGWhM AM~A lbecallm we want. to elleoli'iige,people like, yourself who luwoeimitt'd tholimeiy'O ouit of tho, false' luoNiton whiki tiey iitially took and hay. rteachetI the jN)Nit-oyii ~~hI yo 1m ritel~iel, 'Volt iitiieiSt~uI what (1oi111i111itiii 'etily w(Iild miiti to 114t Iin 'iitr.~ I tihilk you 141A%1doig it 3iiti'ot 10 N'i'Vk'I, IIIIIl I til, 11li1t. n141t only 141yolu, m throith you, it) ill thot wVlo, like yoiii'se1f, would like to1 ii ho01101111i1 agt'd Into thatl attitilde.

Mr. TAVwER. Will you tell the committee, pleas., what your formal educational training has been? Dr. Ltwis. Yes. I went through Hamper Union High School. I graduated there. Got a B. A. degree from San Jose State College in 1980, master's degree from Stanford, postgraduate work done in 1984,1985, and my degree awarded in 1937 after completing the thesis, and the doctor's degree awarded from Stanford University in 1950.
Mr. TAVENNEt. low are you now employed? Dr. Ltwis. I am a profesor at San Jose State College at San Jose, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged in teaching at that institution? Dr. Lzwis. Since the fall of 1949.
Mr. TAv=Nxn. Would you tell the committee briefly what your other employment has been as a teacher? * Dr.Luwk The yar preceding my work at SanJos State Collee I worked in a staff capacity for s commission a lay commission in California called the State Commission on School Districts. I did that from the period after the War until I went to San Jose. COMMUNIST AC'rlVITIRES IN TII LOS 0 ANUIIiES* ARINA 527 The~preceding 81/1 years I was in the United Statess Navy a comimissioned officer anT canine out a lieutenant commander. Before that I taught from 1931 to 1942, before I went in the Navy, at Glendale College at Glendale, Calif. Before that I had taught part time in the evenings during the early thirties in the adult school in San Jose while I was employed in the daytime as a truckdriver and warehouseman,
Mr. 'T'AVRNNER. Have you been a member of the Communist Party at any time? Dr. Lawis. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVPNNFJt. Over how long a period of time were you in the partyI Dr. Lzwis. Well, my recollection of it is It was around the end of the year 1935 or the beginning of the year 1930, until about late In 1939 or early 1940.
Mr. TAvmNNPR. Now, during that period of time you were engaged in the teaching profession, I believe? Dr. Lnwis. 'hat is right. 
Mr. TAvSNNP.R. Will you tell the committee, please, the circtn- stances under which you joined the party ? Dr. Lpwzs. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAvpr;NNP,. That is, the Communist Party. Dr. Lxwts. Right. When I finished my graduate work first in 1935 1 had gone through a period of years in which I had difficulty in getting started in my profession. A great many people had in the early hirties. I was somewhat frustrated and was ambitious, but it was a difficult thing to get a start. For that reason I went back to Stanford. During the period of my education there I became aware of the fact the Teachers' Uion was in activity. It appealed to me as probably a very worthwhile organization that was working for the interests of the teaching profession. When I came to southern California I looked up the Teachers' Union in Los Angeles and became a member. Being somewhat, I would say, an eager beaver I became known because I talked and took part, andI was interested and I found I was being included in caucus discussions. Small groups of people would get together and talk about the problems of the union and some of the program that was being carried on. It was sort of a gravitational thing. I found one evening, through this particular group meeting, that evening, there was a unit of the Communist Party in the Teachers' Union and would I like to be a member and I said lYes." I would like to say, gentlemen, that I think there is, as other wit. nesses have indicated who have talked with you freely as I do, that it is not a verg, easy thing to talk about these things, because you feel so foolish afterwards. You look back and say you don't now how a person could do that. But it looked so easy and seemed so unimportant at the time. In that period it was easy just to say, "This looks like a fine thing." I would like to als point out the one thing about communism I discovered, after considerable time, that it takes many phases and has appeals to almost any kind of interest. A person who has an enthusiasm for doing a job in a field that is important to people, there is usually a place for him to work where communism has a part. 528 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THR L1 ANORGLS ARIA I found that at the time, and I have no regrets about this, and I don't think anyone elm will either, who worked in it, that at the time we felt that the Teacher' Union was trying to do something for the teachig i)rofemiolu and for tle schools. We weren't thinking so much alioit tile ultimate ends that communism had ilntelded for 1s,, and we were pretty unaware of them, I think. At, any rate, that is how we got. in. You sort of gravitated in from the union.
Mr. Avr.NNrJt. Your induction Into the (,omnuniRt Party isintereating because I believe you are alout tie first witNess who got into tle Communist P'arty froni the Teachers' Union, who lits been before us. lit all the other instances that have been called to our attention the individltals were niembers of the Communist. ]Party which were attempting to infiltrate the Teachers' Union.

Mr. T.%AtNN:II. Of that 'ommnUnist Party effort, Ixecase you were led from the Teachers' Union into the I'arty. Now, when you speak of tie Teachers' Union, What local was it that yOu jointed? Dr. Ltwis. It was tile Los Angeles lowal. I forget the number; 430, I think it was.
Mr. TAVSI4NF.R. 430. )r. lvewis. I think it was. Will you give tile committee an idea of the member. ship of teachers in that union I Dr. Lrwis. I have tried to remember that, I think that the enrolled membership at its peak was probally not over-I am guessing at it now-it was about 400, I would say.
Mr. TAvxNNER. About 400? Dr. jrLwis. Alout 400. There were omne, I suppose, 8,000 to 10,0() teachers in Los Angeles, and the people in the area around that local, as I recall it, represented the Los Angeles County area, isa whole. I think, as Mr. Herndon pointed out, tile attendance at meetings was somewhere between it100 and 200 usually.
Mr. |'AVE.NNF.R. How mnav Clonmmmunst Party members were there in your cell or group of the Oommunist Party? Dr. IJwAs. My recollection of it at any one time is that it probably wasn't more than a dozen at. the most, sometimes fewer. There may have been 1 or 2 more. There were always at least, my recollection is, about 10 or 12.
Mr. TAvr.NNM. Do you know whether there were any other Communist Party units or groups within your local consisting of 400 mmbemt
Mr. Lzwm. If there was one, I didn't know about it, I was not aware of it. I don't think there was.
Mr. TAvENNF.R. Can you tell the committee how many locals of the Teachers' Union there were in the State of Californis at that time?
Mr. Lwms. At that time, my.best recollection of it is that there were probably 4 or 6, perhaps, I think. I am Just guessing at this. I am not mire, to tell you the truth.
Mr. TAVENN V.. Can you give tile committee the names of tile areas or any other title or name that the locals had I 
Mr. TAV.NNR.. COMMtIiST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 529 ,Mr. Lkwis. Well I ant pretty sure there was 1 in Saeramento, and I think there was I in Palo Alto, and I think there was 1 in San Diego. And I don't know whether there was I in San Jose, or not. I really don't know. I wasn't aware of it when I was there. Those are the only ones I would suspect, but even then I am guessing, because I am not too sure of the period.
Mr. TAvHNNvJx. Do you have any information or general knowledge as to the membership of the Teachers' Union in these various locals or iII the State as a whole?

Tlhat is why I say I was in a position where 1 should have known, and if I had known my business better I prob: ably could have told you how inany netnbers there were. , Sir. 'rAvrNNOR. (atn you tell the committee what in your judgment was the principal interest of this Conmunist Party group to which you were affiliated
Mr. l.wis. Well, my recollection of it. is that, the primary interest of this Comatiunist Party grolp was the Teachers' Union, that wag its primary function. It was concerned with the things that teachers were concerned about, teacher welfare, retirement, tenure, and so on. IThe second facet of its program, of course, was the study of communisin and its function in Aterican life. Those two phases of the work. I think Mr. lerndon brought it out, as you know he and I were in there together for quite a while, as you can see from outr dates, we weren't very much students, we were more concerned with the present. We had come out of the depression and we were concerned with tite teachers and the teaching situation the schools,and as t result our studies were secondary, in my opinion, they certainly were with me, to the job I felt that was inportant in the schools themselves, which was working with teachers to improve the teaching profession, which, 31747-.i--lit. 2--7 580 COMUIST ACTIVITIES IN I'I? 1,8 AJ01LN1 ARICA byl te way, I think Is i worthy motive. Some things hang on to where the motives sometimes are not worthy.
Mr. JAoes. Do you think It is it matter of great concern to the omnimunist Party I 1Mr. Lawis. I tink at the timo-mnty recollection of it, sir, is that I don't think at that time it wis of much concern. Maybe I was wrong, Mabe I didn't know. And I xmibly didn't. Iut. I felt that we were isolats, tit we were isolated from the main stramin of the party, and one of t 1o reasons for that is that we had so seldom ever seen anyone who could be called a party official in our group, and we had prac. tically no contact with them, as far is I know. It was, as I say, out olMr. the JAKM. main stream. I don't know whether I made the import of my quoes. ion absolutely clear. Do you think (flat the plight of teachers gen. orally, with respect to pay and working standards and things of that sort wais actually a matter of dee l) concern to tho CounntsL Party I ir,L:wvie. I see what you mean.

Mr. Lawts. That is what I would sy, sir, yes, that they had usedin aly group of people you can find something that, is important to them. Take that important thing an(i hiang your program on it, and go along with it, and you have the people.
Mr. JACKsoN. You pick tip a lot. of j~ople along the way doing itI
Mr. Lpwis. Yes. And very many innocent people, too. And I hope you gentlemen appreciate that in my comments on ths Teachers' Union I want to be sure that you understand I don't feel there were lots of Communists in tie Teachers' Union, but a lot of people who were seriously sincerely concerned in the welfare of the teaelng profession and Ielt that was a good way to help it, and probably were completely unaware, except Ixoqsl)ly ill rart inoments, if even at all, that they were being guided in any way. I want to make that clear. Beaune there ire sueh people, inny of them.
Mr. TAVENN=. Yes, and that is one reason why I brought out the exact faets about the membership.

Mr. IiwS. I think there was some of both, sir, but I think te outside source is the sparkplug. In other words, directives were brought in which Indicated that the thinking at the present moment was so and so. 'T'hat is what I think, if I may use the word-maybe it is not a good one-discnchunted a lot of people wto thought that the Communist Party represented a very fine aRvanwe'nent of democracy. We were sold some vlry fine words along that line. Since thiat was one of the feelings that people hd, that we had at the time, these proposals that caniein, many of them, were along the lines that many people felt were the right thing, you see. We were against isms, against facism, against oppression, against any big man taking on a little man, oppremion of all kinds, and, as a matter of fact, as I say, we weren't a violent group of people. I think personally thei closest I have ever come to violence was wrestling on TV. I mean we weren't talking in terms of revolution, but the ideas that we wore bringing forward were ideas that were common to a great many people at the time, but they did come as directives: Here Is a program, there is going to be a meeting, here we are to smpport' this group. $82 OUbMNIN'i AC't'IViT1iit IN TWO 1LON AN011i~M A~iA And t Would 5tvk there wm it stslon i uit, It, auud ltmidlyV it rather mdtitutlu a~oC p1 itw of whaitt lutui ls4'el btmugt III, aImtIt,Ititlmt. bm Al VIg it, You met.

Mr. Liawift. No; I wouldn't say so, sir. Let's sav this, however: I thilik we must be very cautious to intliente fit tanybody is tin entity, a piersonality is comp~lete, a person w~ho has thoughts along certhain lines, it sems to ine, reveals those thoughlts by his reactions, the eyebrows lie raises at the wrong time or right time, so it would bie folly to say thatt we didn't, influence or try to influence, because even subciosionusly a person might have brought. forth a viewpoit toward one thing or another, because of its i mIxolnne, flhn could have planted a seed, you mee. So I wouldn't say thint, we didn't. But what I (lid say was-and I believe this istrue in my recolledtion of it-there was no planning, "This we will do next, and we will get tilil% kids4 to think lb s, and then we will get the kids to think thatl" That wasn't done.
Mr. CiLumr. Wasn't that largely because they knew they were deal- ing with an intellectual group who could be relied on to work out their own devices and plans to promote the party policy I OM S4UNETS? ACIVITIN IN THW LS ANON198, AREA 
Mr. Luwis. I suspect that may have been so. And it also may have boon- think thrit's right. I don't know what the thought, reeliy, and we hadn't though about what they thought, thr.
Mr. CiAumur. Wouldn't you sy that they probably planted the original seed in your minds and then loft the tactics more or less up to you within some broad general limits which they established?
Mr. Luwts. I think sir, we were what you might call a highly autonomous group. I don't think they know much about us or about how we worked, or what we could do, but they loft it up to us, as you say, I think that's right, in the teacher group.
Mr.TAveNtnR. Your value to the Connunist Party or the value of your group went back largely to the question of your own indoc. trination Into the principles of the Communist Party, and therefore your influence on your associates in that manner f
Mr. Lws. I thInk so, I think that's right, sir; yes,
Mr,TAVrNNR. I would be very 1had to have you describe, in any way it occurs to you that you should do so, what you think of the use of an active Communist Party member today as a teacher in our plu)lic schools, or any schools, for that matter.
Mr Lwis. The thing that you were discussing with Mr. Herndon I
Mr. TAvYrNN . Yes. 
Mr. Lxwis. Right. I have formulated over a number of years a very strong feeling about that, and itties up very much with what Hemdon said. Inthe first place, I am a great believer In what we have called acdemio freedom. But I think what Horndon pointed out, and what I would like to repeat ier, is that we are pretty clearly in mind now, and I think everybody in this audience is clearly in mind, that you are not a freethinker when you follow party police. We were deluded,
Mr. Tavenner, once upon a time, to believe quite honestly that the Communist Party was almost'the most democratic thing that God had created, although He didn't have anything to do withf it in this Instance but it was democratic. And we have since found perfectly clearly t'hat the orders come from above. It is not autocracy, it is a militaristic type of structure. Now, how can a person defend himself in the name of academic freedom when he is receiving orders from someone else and has to follow the line or get out or be hurt? It seems to me, then, with the logic that way, that we have on one hand we must respect the fact that there is a concept of academic freedom, which does not provide us with the opportunity to have academic license, which means to pass on orders that have been handed to us, on to other people, just as a matter of handing it out. So, in short, then, I don't see how a person today could be an active Communist and be useful as a teacher in our country.
Mr. Sitramn. That is one question I didn't have to ask.
Mr. Crmwr. Witness, those of you who have finally awakened, of course, obviously came out from under the opiate rather gradually, as other witnesses have expressed, and as you have inferred: Don't you think that probably you lose the proper concept of academic fmredom somewhat in reverse order that gradually you submerged your own personality into that of the party linet In other words, they gave you orders of small importance first, and gradually increased it, as someone goes on the dope, so to speak I COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THNIO LOS ANOGZLPS AICA 535 
Mr. Lawi, I think probably, sir, that could be described as the evolution of It. I think one thing could be made clear here, and I think this should be of comfort to other people who might want to come before you sometime. I think they recognize thit you recognize that a person doesn't just suddenly become one anI thien suddenly stop becoming one. You sort of go along through a period of evolution while you are having troubles, or something else, like we did in the depression years, and many of- us ha0d personal difficulties, and you find things that you grope for to help you, and these look good, and that is the time those boys move in on you, when you are groping. 18hen when the time comes that you see it isn't all like it looked, then you begin to move out again, and you don't just chop it off, but you start wrestling with it, you see, and It takes time.
Mr. SminmP.R. Hasn't your experience indicated that the party, even tolay, is trying to create dissensions in order that it can noi into etain groups and therein create dissension among people
Mr. Lrzws. Taat's right.
Mr. Scz.nma. So it can move in I
Mr. Litwis. It feeds on them.
Mr. Scizmru. In 1939 our economic system perhaps provided those frustrations without the party's help
Mr. Lxwzs. That's right.
Mr. Soamitim. Now they set minority against majority to create those things to enable them to move in, Isthat a correct statement I
Mr. Lawis. I think that is true. I am not aware how it is functioning today, except I read what I read in the papers. But I think that is good enough guide for me. I do say this, it is one of the reasons--now, mind you, I want to be careful about this, because I don't want to cause any misunderstanding, there are many people right now who believe that the trade-union upproach to teachers' organization is a good one, and I am not criticizing that fact at all, I believe if they want to believe that they should; however, my personal feeling, one of the things that got me out of the Communist Party was my reaction to the fact that the trade-union philosophy, with all die respect to labor, the trade-union philosophy was not the kind of organization for the teaching profession, for several reasons that to me are very sound. Number 1, we teach all the children of all the people. Number 2, ve represent rather a unique kind of function in our society, in which we are representing all the people through a board of education, through school administrators, and through the teachers who have just one job, and that is giving good education to children. Therefore, the trade-union concept of separating employment from management as a bargaining function causes a breakdown in the coordination necessary to make good schools, which is based upon lull understanding and coordination of the board, which is the public, the teachers, and the administrators. Do I make my philosophy clear on that? That is one ot the things that drew me strongly away from the trade. movement, which of course was steering union it. movement and the party
Mr. ScHEarJt. A teacher is largely part of government itself, the same as thee deputy marshals sitting here. '536 'COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. Lmwzs. That's right. We are an instrument of the state, shall we say, sir. I
Mr. Socnum When you accept employment with government you become part of government and you forego certain rights that belong to people engaged in private industry, don't you, is that what you I mean
Mr. LEwis. Well, that is the idea. I wasn't thinking of it in exactly those terms, sir, as much as I was in tying that the principle of negotiating for the welfare of a school group, without seeing it as a total entity of school administration, the public, and teachers working together for children. When you divide up in such ways that you can't work that way, then you have broken down something that I think is fundamental in education in the United States. I am not saying-you understand what I moan here? I want to be sure that we don't say a teacher renounces his rights, whatever they may be, when he becomes a teacher. He is even more aware of his rights, it seems to me, more aware of his privileges. But lie is just as much more aware of his responsibilities.
Mr. ScHtER. Another facet of the problem, perhaps?
Mr. LE'wJ5. Yes, another emphasis, perhaps.
Mr. CLARnY. Witness, to carry the earlier thought one further step I don't mind confessing that for quite some time I was concerned, i could not find in my own thinking the answer to the problem that you are giving us now and that the other witnesses have given since I have been on this committee, amid that question was: How on earth was'it possible for anyone of the intellectual capacity that a teacher. and a professor must'be. how is it possible for such a person to ever so far submerge his intellectual freedom, his ideas, to that of the Communist Party line? I couldn't find that. I found that in not only your testimony, but in that of many witnesses I have heard since I have been on this committee. And I think one of the most important things that you are doing and the other witnesses are doing is getting across to the public generally the real explanation of how that thing happens, how you get wound up, and then how you unwind. And it ties in with this. We are being attacked continuously, rabidly, by* 
Mr. SCHERER. You mean the committee?
Mr. CLARDY. Yes. Being continually attacked, as witness one of the incidents yesterday, and what you saw in the papers last night, by members of the cloth and others, who claim we are subverting academic -freedom, and that the very way in which we conduct our hearings is destroying the American concept of academic freedom. I am laboring this a little bit perhaps, because I think it is a most important point that the committee is reaching for in bringing people of your kind before us. 1 want you to again bear with me a moment. Dr. LnwIs. All right.
Mr. CLARDY. Isn't it true that academic freedom and membership in the Communist Party are utterly irreconcilable? Dr. L~wis. That is right, sir. That is my opinion now and has -.been for a long time.
Mr. CLA YD.And that an exposure of that fact-and that 's what this committee is trying to do-will probably be the best product of this committee's work, if we can do that? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 537 Dr. Lvws. That is right, sir. May I comment on that, sir? 
Mr. C,,ARDY. I wish you would. Dr. Lzwis. To do it I have to put some ashes on my head.
Mr. CLARDY. Let me tell you tids: There are none amoig us that have not made mistakes. I look back on the way I tried some of my early cases and I am ashamed of what I did to some of my early clients. . Dr. LUwis. That is a great comfort. I think one of the most-I have to say this, too-one of the most important things that has occurred to me, and I think should be said, is the fact that a pot-son like me and Herndon and others in this group, I am sure, are going to come forward to speak out, that they suddenly discover they have an whale of a lot of friendsMr. CLARDY. You bet they do. Dr. Lwis. Who have confidence in them. 
Mr. CLARn. If they could see the pile of telegralms and mail we get they would understand just how right you are in what you say. Dr. Lwis. Thank you, sir.
Mr. CLARDY. Go ahead. Dr. LEwi. Fine. It is with that spirit and support that a person can say, "Look how stupid I was." I would like to add something at this point, sir. Nobody can quite explain why those things happen to people because every man grows up a little differently. It seems to me our big problem right now is to try to avoid the mistakes like people like I have made. (Representative Donald L. Jackson reentered the hearing room at this point, 8: 05 p. m.) Dr. LEwis. And what should they (lot It seems to me no one should ba put in the position that I was put in. You know tie story, I guess. It is what they say about contracts, that the large print griveth and tile fileprint taketh away.
Mr. ULAnDY. You are speaking of insurance contracts? Dr. LEwis. Perhaps. Perhaps we didn't read the fine print. What are the factors that keep a person from reading fine print? (Representative Morgan M. Moulder reentered the hearing room at this point, 3: 07 p, in.) Dr. LEwis. Mainly ignorance of the facts. It seems to me the more widespread information like this can be given to the people, the more information they will have and the fewer people will be dupes. I am convinced an ignorant man is duped. As I say, I will put some ashes on my head.
Mr. CLARDY. Let me disagree slightly with you. Isn't it true that sometimes because of the self-interest in some particular problem and the Communists cultivate that, that you become suddenly blind to the fine print, so to speak, and you don't discover it until you find out you were sold down the river on the original proposition that brought you in?

When I was served with the subpena there were itsubstantial number of people who, at the time, had known about this for various reasons, why I don't nieed to explain, I nm sure. However, the mminumt1e it was out, it was annomined in'the lIi)pers and I had no reaction except favorable sport from hundreds and hundreds of people. I could get, if the committee wished-I would be glad to get-another deluge of letters-from people who have known my work for about 12 to 15 years, or more, who would give me moral support, who came forward and said, "We have confidence in you. Go to ft." It bothers me to think-and again some more ashes-why itperson doesn't realize that tle confidence of the people, you can't Lave Iuore confidence in tie people when you are liked than when you are em- barrassed. A person can be very fearful of being embarrassed. Bit once you get it out in the open you find you have your friends with you, and people that know you back you up. There is no reaction except one of great relief. It is now open and you can, in fact, be kidded. That is the first thing. The second thing, I was delighted with the community reaction in our own community, where the papers pointed out, in what I would call very stable tones, that this committee was doing a job and those people who came before it should not be considered criminals or in any way unpleasant characters, because they were called by the com. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TU LOS ANGELES AREA 541 mittee.

I do no for the follow- imng~ve reasonst.Thpy are bMief and succinct, and I would like to Ito able to state then%in full. No, 1, as an employee of the State of Californa I um subject to the ,statutory tenor provisions with whild the people of this Stato have seen fit to protect te rights of tie teachers of thehi Whihlhn. l'rheo are in division I of the State education code. Under tile law of this State, also, I huave subsclbed to all the required oaths and declarations relating to ily loyalty, including, to ti moner'Y, the following: ,iAoath o11 eceOiving imy tolllng credentials in 1934. A11 onth on 1roeivina my lifetime teaohlog ei d ential in 1042. The Los Allgehs bAt of lily Board of Edication loyalty reaoflirtmation oath in 1948. The State Levering Act oatlh of 1060. Also, 1 have taken approximately 4,000 pl)edges of allegiance during my 19 yeals of telshing.

'No. 2. Since I have sworn its an employee of the State of California to support and defend the Constihtiion of the United States, and df the State of California, I calmot violate that oatth, nor will I he coipolled to repudiate that Oath. This requires that I resist any abridgment of constitutional' rights for myself anid for others. I have taught my students to honor and live by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I can do no less myself. NO. 3.The Education Code of California, section 18280, in one sentence states: Eitch teacher shall endavor to impress upon th mind of the h pils t1o principles of morality, truth, justle, anm patrlotsmn; to teavh thll to:avold idlene., profatly, anti ftlsehotil; to imtruct then in the liviiit ieg of free governuteut, and to train them titl to a tried comprehension of the rights, duties, and dgilty of American cltienship.

Mr. MfINKUS. Almost.
Mr. JAOKSOX. If you will please expedite it.
Mr. MiNxus. The Federal Constitution includes in the fifth amendment the provision that no person may be compelled to bear wit ness against himself, a privilege which was (deignedfor the protection of innocent people, and I invoke each and every part of the fifth amendment for myself as a restriction upon this committee, and to help protect this basic constitutional right for all people, thereby fulfilling my oath as a teacher which I must not violate, to protect and uphold the Constitution of the United States. VOMMUIIW AC1Lz11II IN TJUN 1,0 545 ANGIPMES ARRIA so. 6.

Mr, JAoxSoI4, That has not been suggested. Counsel, I wish you would press for the answer to the question now pendnlg, and let's get on with the or hrly conduct of this committao.
Mr. MNV. I still have not finished my answer to the last question.
Mr. TAV NNE. Mr. Chairman it is purely a question of whether or not he will be permitod to read tie rust1 of the opinion from the Court consisting of four lines.
Mr. JACKSON. If it will ffaCilitate the meeting, and it undoubtedly will, without objection on tie part of any nionfier of the committee, these four lines may be concluded. However, thereafter and for the bahce of these hearings-at least at sutel times as i have the,chair-?these long statements are not going to be permitted above and beyond those necessary to identify the portions of the Constitution upon which the witness is basing Itis declinations. The witness nay continue.
Mr. MINKUs. Thank you very ntuch,
Mr. CiARYr. May I be sure that this is conditioned upon the fact that he admits that ie is reading the decision of the court? If he does, I have no objection to his finshing.
Mr. JACKSON. Proceed. Air. MINRS. Thank you very much, Mr. Jackson, (Continuing to read.) Through the harassment of hearings, Investigations, reports, andsubpenas, government will hold a club over speech and over the press. Congress could not do this by law. The power of investigation is also limited. Inquiry into lprsonal and private affairs is precludel, and so Is any matter in respect to which no. valid legislation could be had. .. I have finished and thank you very much, Congressman Jackson.
Mr. JAcKsoN. Continue, Ar. Counsel. Nfr. TAvE mNr. Mr. Chairman, the only ground assigned for refusal to answer the question Which is recognized as a valid ground by ihi namely, the. fourth matter which committee was thebut s voluntary it occurs to me thatlieinmentioned lihton fifth amendment, statement he has waived the fifth amendment when he stated to the committee that he had seen an article in the press which larged that by the testiniony of certain witnesses the Communist Party had taken over the Teachers' Union and that this was absolutely not truet or words to that effect. So I think I am entirely within my rights in insisting upon an answer to questions relating to his knowledge or lack of know edge of th Cnimniunist Party effort to influence and control' that union of which he spoke. COMMiJWIHT AIVITIM IN' TFF, IA AN(OPJEKR AIMA 49

Mr. TAVENNERI. Mr. "Minkus, on what do you base your statement that the newspaper. article carrying an account of the hearing was false? May I amplify that question a little, so that there wfllbe no misunderstanding about it?
Mr. ESTEIIAN. I think you misquoted the statement. May we have it readV
Mr. TAVENNER. I am sorry. I didn't hear you.
Mr. ESTE IMAN. I think you misquoted his statement.
Mr. TAvNNzt. Mr. Reporter, did you get the statement at the beginning of the testimony that he volunteered?
Mr. -REMoMrn. I was not here.
Mr. TAFENNFip. Then I will have to rely upon my recollection. I understand that the reporters have been changed since the witness took thp stand, and that the reporter who is now present was not here at thAt time.
Mr. CLARDY. Well, ask the witness what he said.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Minkus, did you not state in effect to this com- mittee that you had seen an article in a paper which you referred to the testimony that was taken here this morning, and that that article was to the effect that the Communist Party hadtaken over the Teachers' Union, teachers local union, in Los Angeles, and that you bitterly denounced that fact as being false. (At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. MINi us. I prefer to rely on the record, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. CLARDY. Mr. Chairman I ask that he be directed to answer.
Mr. JACKSON. The question is somewhat involved. If it can be put in the form of several short brief questions it would greatly facilitate the answering, I think, and also clarify the matter for the chair. I don't 7',iow that I fully understand the import of the question myself.
Mr tAvENNER. Mr. Minkus, will you state what you told the committeu"? Mt,. MINxus. It is in the record. 1 .'. TAVENNER. Well, what is it? At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. ScriEni. I move that the witness be directed to answer. 
Mr. JACKsON. Mr. Counsel, is there any way you can rephrase that question or bteak it down?
Mr. TAv.wm. Yes; I think I can.
Mr. Minkus, did you not tell the committee that It was untrue or that it was false that the Communist Party had gotten control of the local union, the local Teachers' Union in Los Angeles? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 551. (At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. MiNKus. I think that the best way to get that is to bring in the record. I don't feel that I am required to engage in any memory test.
Mr. JAoKsox. Mr. Minkus, are you a member of the Communist Party? (At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. MiNrvus. I will answer neither yes nor no to this question and to all other questions like it, for the following reasons: No. 1Mr. JAcKsoN. The reasons have already been given, if those are the reasons upon which you relied originally. Are they the same reasons? (At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. MirNus. I wish to give my full answer, unless the question is withdrawn.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, the question is not going to be withdrawn and the committee is not going to listen to a review or to a prolonged argument on the question. You have advanced 4 or 5 reasons for your declination to answer a previous question. I am asking you whether these are identical to the reasons that you gave before. (At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. MiNKUs. Thank you very much for waiting, Mr. Jackson. I would like to give in full the answer that I gave previously, if that will be allowed.
Mr, JACKSON. You decline to answer that question ?
Mr. MINKUS. I have answered the question.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you decline to answer the question for the reasons previously stated? 
Mr. MiNKUs. I have given my answer.
Mr. JACKSON. Your answer has not bee~given. I have asked you if you are a member of the Communist Party. I should like to have a yes or no answer or a declination upon constitutional grounds. (At this point Mr. Minkus conferred with Mr. Esterman and Mr. Marshall.)
Mr. MiNKus. In that case I would like to give my reasons.
Mr. JACKSON. Are those the same reasons you read into the record at the outset? 
Mr. MINHus. They are.
Mr. JACKSON. Is it essential that you read them again at this time, or is this just a-delaying tactic on your part to further delay and harass the committee and handicap its operationsI Your previous answers are a matter of record here.
Mr. MINKUs. Which part of your question am I to answer?
Mr. JACKSON. You can answer any part of it, pick out any part you want, Those are the same reasons you advanced, is that correct?
Mr. MINKUS. Yes.
Mr. JAcKsON. Which are already in the record.

Mr. TAVENNER. Anne Kinney, also known as Jane Howe, testified before the committee on December 22, 1952. She told the committee she had joined the Communist Party in 1933 and remained a member until 1945. She was a member of the group of the Communist Party which was organized within the Teachers' Union Local 430. Both she and the two witnesses who appeared on the stand this morning, that is, Mr. LeRoy Herndon and Mr. Richard B. Lewis, all three testified that you were a member of that group with them.

Mr. E'm WiAN. We will wait until, you bring the record in. Isn't it in the building?
Mr. CLARDY. It is not the fault of the committee or of counsel that this matter necessarily must be carried over until tomorrow, and I think it should be carried over and completed tomorrow. The business of the committee demands us to finish up here soon, so we may be back at our work in Washington, as you well know. I suggest that we should call this man again in the morning and conclude it. Counsel well knows, because we have all practiced law for some time, that these changes come about and are necessitated many times. I suggest we call him tomorrow.
Mr. ESTRRMAN. May the record show I discussed this with Mr. Tavenner and that he knows I am leaving by plane in the morning and I will not be back until Sunday night. He knows that.
Mr. JACKSON. What suits the convenience.of counsel in this matter?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I do know that counsel cannot be here because of other plans he has told me about. And other witnesses that lie had were put over until Monday, for that reason. I think this is a rather important phase of this witness' testimony and I would not like to see him deprived of any of his counsel during that period. I think we should either get the record this afternoon or we should put it over until Monday morning.
Mr. CLAiDY. Then I am prepared to stay until we get it. I want to c nplete this while it is fresh in my mind.
Mr. JACKSON. Several of the committee members have important meetings at this time and other obligations. Therefore, it is necessary that we terminate today's hearing at this time. The witness will be set for Monday morning.
Mr. ESTERMAN. Ten o'clock?
Mr. JACKSON. Ten o'clock, Counsel.

Mr. Vmum. The committee will come to order. Let the record show that a full quorum of the committee is present. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Walter. - Mr. WAIrvm. Mr. Chairman, on yesterday there appeared in a local newspaper an editorial entitled, "Walter Lacks Proof for Slur on the Union." The fact of the matter is what I said was not intended to be a slur on the union and it was not a slur on the union. As a matter of fact, if any implication is to be drawn from what I said, it is to the effect that the union was in no wise connected with this act of sabotage. This is an example of the ends that certain segments of the press go to in an attempt to discredit the work of this committee.
Mr. CLAwY. I understood your efforts to imply, at least, that the sabotage might conceivably be charged to some Commie influence.
Mr.WrR. Of course. The man who had testified, in connection with whose testimony this statement was made, was not a trade unionist.
Mr. CLAnDY. He was talking about the spike-throwing incident, as I recall it.
Mr. WAurzr. That is correct. It seems to me that every trade union should resent. this attempt to speak of communism and unionism as being synonymous.
Mr. CLADY. You recall the last witness last night immediately started off on that attack. Mr. WATr. Of course.

I had expressed myself quite freely as being anti-Communist, but I didn't quite feature ever becomin a. member of the Communist Party. I hesitated, and then, when-ho informed me that there was one group in my area that they, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had never been able to get a line on, as it were, I changed my mind and told him I would. This was on Tuesday. I told him I would let him know for sure on Thursday. I asked him for information and adviceMr. TAvzstN .

Mr. TAVENNSER. I notice on 1 page there are a number of stamps, 0 stamp., showing 10 cents each, at the bottom of each stamp.
Mrs. MACIA. rhat represents dues. The dues were paid, and the reason that 12 of them are not in was because they didn't have stamps at the time, the Communist Party didn't have stamps at that time, and instead they marked it paid. 
Mr. TAvxNNsX. Is that card signed by the State chairman of the Communist Party.

Mr. TAV:NNE.R. If you will hand it to the committee so they may examine it, please. 
Mr. Doyix. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Dovr.x. Undoubtedly our distinguished counsel is-undotbtedly you are going to read into the record, for the benefit of the public, the rights and duties of party members; are you, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVI.NNEI1. Yes, sir. That appears on the back of the card. It reads as follows: Rights and duties of party members: To at all times loyally defend the Interests of the working class against the forces of fascism and reaction; to fight all kinds or forms of national oppression, discrimination and segregation; to fight ideological Influences that oppress racial minorities; to fight for the full social, political and economic equality of the Negro people; to fight for Negro and white unity; to attend club meetings, read the party press and literature, pay dues regularly and be active on behalf of the program and the policies of the party; to participate In the working out of policies and tasks of the club, and to regularly examine the execution of such policies; to vote for officers, committees, and delegations and be elected to any office or committees In accordance with provisions of the constitution; to appeal any .decision with which there ts disagreement to the next higher body, carrying out the decision while the appeal is pending; to strive to master the program and policies of the party, the principles of Marxism and Leninism. Were cards of a similar nature issued to all the Communist Party members at the time that you were issued this card, that is, to members of your group ?
Mrs. MACIA. Yes; they were.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have here 4 receipts or papers indicating that they tire receipts. I would like to hand them to you and ask you to identify them andtell the committee what they are.
Mrs. MACIA. I have 4 and the first one is dated April 2, 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. In whose name is it made out?
Mrs. MACA. To Edda N.-just "N." My name is not written in.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it a receipt for dues for that period?

Mr. Vraum;. It is so ordered, without objection. This evidence will be received. (Tie document referred to was received in evidence and marked "Macia Exhibit No. 2.")
Mr. IrAVFNNEi. Does the memorandum on the back of that receipt refresh your recollection as to what business was transacted or d[scussed at the meeting which was held about April 7, 1940, or shortly thereafter?
Mrs. MACIA. I wouhl say yes; to the best of my knowledge, it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe it; tell us what those matters related to?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, one of the questions that I have written in was evidently asked by some member of the group, "Is not Soviet Russia practically imperialism?"
Mr. TAVENNER. Nbw, just a moment. Do you recall now what the trend of the discussion was on that subject ?
Mrs. MACIA. No; I do not. It was just a question that arose and we just discussed it at length, but my reason for being at these meetings kept me busy. I really didn't get all that transpired in tie discussion.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do I understand that your principal purpose was to ascertain who were members of this particular group?
Mrs. MACIA. That is correct; yes, sir. I was told to go and find out who they were and what they were doing, and as a result, the names were difficult to obtain, and, as I say, I was too busy getting the names to do much about-to take too much part in the discussion.
Mr. TAvENNF.R. If you will proceed, what other notations do you find on the back of the receipt which may indicate the subject under -discussion I
Mrs. MACIA. One is "Demands on Iran what right had the Russian representative to walk out in the United Iations P The next one is, "What will happen if the U. S. S. R.representative -does not return tomorrow?" 8174-18-pt. 2-9 562 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA

Mrs, MACIA. I have three more.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give their dates, please?
Mrs. MACIA. February 4, 1947, and I was paying 35 cents dues at that time. 
Mr. TAVFNNER. Whose initials are signed as treasurer at that time? 
Mrs. MACIA. R. IX. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whose name R. K. stood for?
Mrs. MACTA. Yes; I do. It was the wife of the treasurer of our group. Rose Kline was the name.
Mr. TAvNNFR. Rose Kline. Would you spell Kline? 
Mrs. MACIA. K--i-n-e.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name of the organization referred to in the left-hand margin?
Mrs. MACIA. The West AdamsMr. TAVENNER. The same?
Mrs. MACIA. W. A., just the same.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the receipt in evidence and ask it be marked as "Macia Exhibit No. 3."
Mr. VELDE. It is so ordered and the exhibit will be admitted. (The document referred to was received in evidence and marked "Macia Exhibit No. 3.")
Mr. TAVENNER. A photostatic copy will be furnished. The next?
Mrs. MACIA. The next is issued in the name of Edda N., just the same, for 35 cents. It is signed "L. S."
Mr. TAVENER. Do you know whose initials they were?
Mrs. MACIA. No; I don't recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name of the organization, or was the name of the organization at that time o
Mrs. MACIA. West Adams, just the same.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. And the next?
Mrs. MACIA. The next is April 12, 1948. I paid $1.10 dues which carried me through to the 1st of January 1949. On the left-hand side of this there is "63-2."
Mr. TAVENNER. What does that indicate?
Mrs. MAc A. That it was the 63d assembly district and there were two parties. That is, there were two groups in that party.
Mr. ToaVNNR. Two groups?
MrM MACIA. Yes.
Mr. TAvrN'NNR. Two groups that consolidated, does it mean that?
Mrs. MAC A. It might mean that or it might be there were two upgradings in the.West Adams. I couldn't tell what it was. It is signed "H. S."'

Mr. TAVENNER. What is the name?
Mrs. MACIA. Helen Samuels, 2012 West 87th Place.
Mr. TAVFYNNEUt. Did you write that on the back of the receipt?
Mrs. MACIA No I did not.
Mr. TAVLNNEm. Was it written on the back of the receipt at the time you received it? 
Mrs. MACIA. It must have been on the receipt at the time I received it, yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What position did she hold at that time in your groupI 
Mrs. MACIA. She was just a member of the group or a visitor, I can't say which. I knew her as a member.
Mr. TAVENNEn. But the initials "I. S." appear above at the space marked "Treasurer's signature"?
Mrs. MACIA. That is true.
Mr. TAVENF.NR. I desire to offer that receipt in evidence and ask it e marked as "Macia Exhibit No. 4." Without objection, it will be admitted in evidence.
Mr. V mEW. (The document referred to was received in evidence and marked "Macia Exhibit No. 4.")
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, just what type of an organization of the Communist Party this was, which you had joined?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, it would be rather difficult for me to say. It was a group that was constantly receiving recruits, now recruits. They came, ini for t few meetings and then went into other groups of the Communist Party. (Representative Donald L. Jackson reentered the hearing room at this point, 9:32 a. m.)
Mrs. MACIA. Whether it was a recruiting organization or not, I ant not sure. The meeting place was the same for about two years and a half.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where was the meeting place?
Mrs. MACIA. It was on West Adams, but I don't have the address; I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNFiR. Then, if I understand you correctly, members of this group were assigned out to other groups of the Communist Party?
Mrs. MACIA. Must have been, because they disappeared from our meeting place and from our group, and evidently went into some other group.
Mr. TAvENNER. Was it what is known as a community or neighborhoot group?
Mrs. MACIA. I would say so, yes. The people who came regularly seemed to live in that area.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the chairman of that group when you entered it? 
Mrs. MAMA. Well, since I am not sure of the date, which I am not, I would rather not answer that question if it is permissible.
Mr. TAvFIIrNE. Yes, if you are in doubtMrs. MACIA. I am in doubt, ye.
Mr. TA wNER. Who was chairman at that time, I would rather you not answer it.
Mrs. MAIA. Well, I will answer that I will give the name later. 564 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA

Mrs. MACIA Yes I did.
Mr. TAVEN N , dust tell the committee how you made that record.
Mrs. MACIA. Well, I made it by sitting as close as I could to the treasurer of the group and watching the cards signed and the receipts issued, and in that way I obtained quite a number of names, and otherwise I Iust watched and listened until I could get the name.
Mr. MOULDER. May I at this point ask a question, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Moulder. 
Mr. MOULDER. Would those names be fictitious, like your own name, or would they be true names?
Mrs. MACIA. A great many of them, I think, were true names.
Mr. MOULDER. You have no way of being sure whether they were or not?
Mrs. MACI. No I haven't.
Mr. TAVEXNER. Vow long a period of time did it take you to obtain a list of the group by the method you have described?
Mrs. MACIA. Many, many months. But it was very hard because they spoke-they called one another by their first names usually.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it your purpose to obtain and list the true names of these individuals or the names, the party names, of the individuals?
Mrs. MACIA. The names that the receipts were issued to, and that perhaps was the party name or their real names, whichever they were using at the time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you preserve the result of your work?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, r have some of it. I don't have it all, but I have some of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have it with you?
Mrs. MACIA. Yes, I do have.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you exhibit, please, to the committee the list of names that you prepared at the time you were a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. MACIA. You want me to give these originals, do you?
Mr. TAvEN-zR. Give the original list as you first prepared it. Those names appear in your own handwritingI
Mrs. MACIA. Yes they do. They were written very hurriedly.
Mr. TAYENNER. I desire to offer the list in evidence and ask that it lri marked "Macia Exhibit No. 5."
Mr. V wn. Without objection, it will be received. (The document referred to was received in evidence and marked "Macia Exhibit No. 5.")
Mr. DOYLE. Counsel, while the committee members are viewing that interesting list, and, apparently, you are waiting for them so to doMr. TAVENmm. Yes. 
Mr. DoyLv (continuing). I wonder if it would be appropriate to ask the witness to.fill in this minute or two, and ask if she has counted the number of names on that original list which she made. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. Have you counted the names?
Mrs. MACu. Yes, I have; 148.
Mr. MOULDER. Ma I inquire?
Mr. Vmrw. Mr. Moulder. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANOELES AREA 565 
Mr. MomEa. Now, as I understand you, those names were taken as the treasurer handed the receipts for the dues.
Mrs. MACIA. Most of them were.
Mr. MoULDER. And you don't know whether or not they were the real names of those persons'?
Mrs. MACIA No I do not.
Mr. MOULD . You don't know whether they were the fictitious names and you have no other way of further indentifying the names of the people on there?
Mrs.MACIA. No, I haven't.
Mr. MOULDER. The point I am trying to get at is, it would be entirely possible then for some person's name to be used who wasn't a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. MACIA. I don't think so.
Mr. DOYLE. What is your answer? I didn't hear that.
Mrs. MACIA. I don't think so.
Mr. MoULDER. I mean by that, say, if some person, who was an active Communist there, might select the name of some prominent citizen for the purpose of not betraying their own name.
Mrs. MACIA. That is right.
Mr. DoYLE. May I ask the witness if she ever heard of that being done in this group, 135 people?
Mrs. MACIA. No.
Mr. DoLE. Did you recognize any prominent citizens there?
Mrs. MACIA No I didn't.
Mr. JACKSO. lqr. Chairman.
Mr. VELD Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. On one of these pages, with reference to one of the names, I see what I interpret to be 'Transfer La Brea and Wilshire."
Mrs. MACIA. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Was that a transfer to or from a branch at La Brea and Wilshire? What is the significance of that?
Mrs. MAoIA. What is the exact wording there?
Mr. JACKSON. It says "T-r-a-n. La Brea and Wilshire."
Mrs. MACIA. He was transferred to La Brea and Wilshire, because I show in all my lists the word "From" wherever I have it.
Mr. JACKSON. There was a branch at La Brea and Wilshire?
Mrs. MAoA. There must have been.
Mr. CLARDY. During this interlude, Mr. Chairman, something else suggests itself to me. I have the Communist Party card in my-hand and I am not sure we have put in the record here the rather interesting bit of information on the inside, under the heading, "Dues Rates." I would like to read that in. It is very brief.
Mr. VELDtE. Proceed, Mr. Clardy.
Mr. CLAn-. Under that capitalized lettering it says, Income over $60 per week, $2 per month. Income $25 to $60 per week, $1. Income under $25 per week, 85 cents. Unemployed, 10 cents. Then beneath it-I don't know where the unemployed would get the dime. Beneath that it says, Read the Daily Worker and the Worker. Read our Monthly Magazine Political Affairs. On the outside I notice they have done a very artistic job on the front page. They have in faint blue letters, as the background of 0566 COMMUNIST ATIVITIES IN THE LOS ANOELES AREA everything, the words "Communist Party of America" repeated over and over again. I haven'tbeen on this committee long enough-do you know whether this Is an exact duplicate of all the other cards we have received in evidence in prior hearings?
Mr. VJi. different. No. As a matter of fact, the cards wore somewhat 
Mr. TAVENNz. different. No, I think it Is not. I think the form is somewhat 
Mr. CLARDY. It is quite an artistic job. 
Mr. VEPLw. In fact, I think up until about the year 1045 '44 or 45, the Communist Party card carried the hammer and sicde and seal, if there is any doubt in anybody's mind that the Communist Party is not connected with Russia in any way.
Mr. Mouwmm. In connection with the questions I asked Tou a mo. ment ago regarding the nanes you took at the meetings, Mr. Wheeler, our Investigator, has informed me he has made a thorough investigation of the names you obtained at those meetings, and 00 percent or more of them were members of the Communist Party and active in Communist affairs.
Mr. MACIA. I am glad to know that.
Mr. TAVENNER. I think the investigator meant that 90 percent had been identified.
Mr. JUc^Ksow. Previously identified I
Mr. TAvNNRn. That is what I understand. Not identified by testimony, but identified by the investigator's work.
Mr. CLARDY. For fear that what I said about the dues might give the wrong impression, we have voluminous testimony to show that in the arts, sciences and professions they have a percentage scale instead of the flat dollar scale that I read in. Sometimes it runs up to 10 percent or more, and they are expected to contribute that on a monthly basis also is that not right?
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe the largest percentages I have heard referred to were 5 percent of the professors' salaries at Harvard University, and 4 percent in Hollywood.
Mr. CLARDY. I recall one witness said it might run that high, but I can't remember his name.
Mr. TAvWNNR. Now, will Tyou read the list of names of those that you identified during the period of time that you were a member of the Communist Party from this first list that you prepared, and where you are able to do it, give the committee the benefit of your recollection as to the part that the individual played in any of the meetings, and any other identifying information that you can give concerning the person.
Mrs. MACmA. Well, I can't give too much, but I shall be glad to do that, Mr. Tavenner. I have no idea of the dates on these.
Mr. TAVEzNNER. I will ask you to give the names slowly and to spell them.
Mrs. MAcIa. This is a revised list that I made, some from memory and some from this list. Is it permissible to give those? They are all people that I can identify.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like for you to give-Mrs. MACU. The list as I had it here? COMMUNIST ACflIVITIRS IN TIIO ,0 ANUELIS AIIZA 567 
Mr. TAVENNV.I1. I think that you should give the list as you prepared it originally and then if there are others that you can identify, to nam t110 oso also.
Mr. Doytta:. May I just ask this question ? It would 'be interestinA to know if the. )uIes wer IIIIle y yout tile tiIe of your ittend. ance at the meetings.
Mrs. MACIA. Well, I made then up after I rettirned hone.
Mr. ])oyta. But within an hour or two after the meetings?
Mrs. MAVIA. Ye1. I wouhl make them out on one slip of paper and then the next on another slip of paper and then put them all together at home.
Mr. )ovtr. In other words, you made a niemorandum in the mcwtin ron i slip of paper. Vrs. MACIA. Yes.
Mr. I)omE~. And when you got home from the meeting you im. mediately transferred what you had on the memorandum which you had mnde in the Communist lParty meeting to this list to which you are now referring.
Mrs. MACIA.'ha t is right.
Mr. Doyr,. Thank you.
Mrs. MACIA. Shall I give the husband's wife's name at the same time, because this is a very long listV
Mr. TAV1NNxr. Just as you like, just so that you cover the list. Possibly it would be bettor to give it in the order in which they appear onthelist.
Mrs. MACIA. Serill Gerber.
Mr. TAvENNER. Will you spell it, please?
Mrs. MACIA. I spelled the first name S-e-r-i-l-l, but it may be C-y-r-i-l, I don't know, and the last name O-e-r-b-e.r.
Mr. TAVENNEIR. What part did he play, if any, in the Communist Party group that you were a mneij)er of?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, at one time he was the chairman of the group.
Mr. TAENNnit. Now, do you know that person's occupation?
Mrs. MACIA. No, not actually I do not. I have been told he is a teacher in the Los Angeles schoo s,
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you tell us how long he was chairman of your group, approximately ?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, le wasn't chairman too long, because he left the group to go to Detroit and remained there evidently for some time. He later returned, and I saw him once afterward. tie did not come back to our group.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say him, what were the circumstances under which you saw him on his return from Detroit?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, there were to be several people come from other groups to visit our group that meeting night, and he was there to place the chairs for seating the additiontil group, but he did not appear at the meetin Lillian Gerber, his wife. Helen and Bob Pate, P-a-t-e. Fred Putman, P-u-t-m-a-n. Joe and Rose Kline, K-I-i-n-e.
Mr. TAvENNER. Now, what was the position of Joe Kline?
Mrs, MACIA. He was the treasurer or the financial secretary. 508 O) IN11lW A(IV1l8t II. 1' (ltep&'entatIJtiiv thim poilt., 9):4lb i, IN 01461 1,018 AN0:1dM AIMA ioe 4.11 I. it lit ei'&d tM eilt111ig tiltan lit) fit hi'.TIAVKNNI'11. illI yoll jIlot-emi1 MiPH.

Mr. Vxz. The Chair, of course, concurs with that. Proceed.

Were you able to identify separately those who catte from the Jefferson Club?
Mrs. MACTA. Yes, I have.
Mr. TAv' xmNE.I (o int want to ask you at this moment who they were, because we are still considering the original membership of your West Adams Club. Now, you say after you moved to the new location for your meetings, why, you, as I understand, prepared a list again.

Mr. TAVE ER. What was the purpose of that?
Mrs. MAC A. Just to add it to my membership, that was the list of membership I was making.
Mr. TAVENNE a. You mean additional persons had joined from the time you prepared the first listI
Mrs. MACIA. Oh, yes, they were joining and being transferred at every meeting.
Mr. TAvNNF.R. Well, will you tell us the circumstances under which you prepared the second list Were they the same as the first list?
Mrs. MACIA. Yes, they were the same.
Mr. TAVENNER. I mean the same method of making the list?
Mrs, MACIA. Yes, just the same exactly. Mir. TAvmNER. Well, when you prepared the second list did you also list the same persons whose names you listed at the first meeting in your first list?
Mrs. MACIA, Yes, I did.
Mr. TAvENNEr. So that this list includes all the original members who were still members of your group at the time you prepared the second list and also the new members?
Mrs. MACTA, Yes, that is correct. (Representative Donald L. Jackson reentered the hearing room at this point, 10:29 a.i.)
Mr. TA imnNEI. Will you tell us when this second list was prepared and how long it took you to prepare it? Mirs. MAC A. I couldn't tell you exactly when it was prepared, but it was prepared during the time I attended the meetings at the West Adams Women's Club, and I would say it took at least a year.

In other words, counsel, you are making it clear, ifI un(lersta d it, that the Women's (lab merely rented the building to this grol)? Mis. MACIA. Yes, tlat is trite. ll'. TAVENNER. That is right. 
Mr. ])ovm,. That is right, Mrs. Macia?
Mrs. MAcTA. Yes, that is right. That is correct.
Mr. TA iNNFIn. Mr. chairman, it nay be that I can help you, from the testimony, as to the (late. The witness has testified that she joined this group of the Communist Party in1943. and my recollection is it was inAugust of 1943, and it took ,bout two and a half years to propare the list which she first testified to, and then later ittook a year to prepare the list which she now has.
Mr.DoYLE. I am assuming,Mr. Chairman, that the Women's Club did not know itwas a Communist cell that were using their building. I am assuming that.
Mr.JACKso. Is that the case?
Mr.DoYiE. I don't know. 
Mrs.MACrA. I hope itis.
Mr.DOYLE. I am assuming that the Women's Club did not knowingly rent this building to a Communist cell.
Mrs. MA0IA. I don't see how they could have helped knowing.
Mr. Doyto. I make that statement in view of the discussion. I think it ought to be made clear in this hearing what the fact was, so the Women's Club will not be criticized, if they are not subject to criticism.
Mrs. MACIA. That is true. 874 COOMMUNit' A(VYI'VPIItS IN TIM'I 104 AN01111h14 AIKA Mti. CLARDY.

Mrs. MACA. Yes there were several of us transferred from the West Adanms Women's Cub meeting place. We were still the West Adams roup. We were transferred to what I called the 30th Street group. don't know what the name of the club was. But I have it in my notes as the 80th Street group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you tell us about the date of that transfer I
Mrs. MACLA. Well, it must have been in the spring of 1048 because I didn't attend too many meetings after being transferred to this group. 
Mr. TAvYENEU. Were very many members of your group assigned to the 80th Street groupI . (Representative b'rancis E. Walter re-entered the hearing room at this point, 10:45 a. in.)

Mr. DOYLE. Was it on East 30th or West 80th?

Mr. D.,YLE. Approximately what block on West 30th?
Mrs. MACIA. It was amout three blocks off Jefferson. I went down on the Jefferson car and walked back. I walked north 2 blocks and east 8 blocks.
Mr. DoyLe. That would be approximately how many blocks west of Main Street or west of Figueroa I Jefferson runs parallel with 80th.
Mrs. MA01A. Yes, I know it does. I really can't tell.
Mr. DoYLz. Was it as far west as the Women's Club Building which had been rentedI
Mrs. MACIA. I don't think so.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. TAvENNEXI. I believe you were preparing to give us the number of people who transferred to that group with you.

Mr. TAVENNE. Will you give the names of the six who were transferred with youI

Mr. TAvENNE. How many were in the new group to which you were assigned, that i, the 80th Street group? Kra. MAO. I really couldn't tell you, because I think I only attended three meetings and there were several of them that didn't ap. pear at the second meeting, and there were others that appeared at the, second meeting, that didn t come to the third, so I never really knew who belonged to this group. It was not a large group, however. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA

Mr. Mom.uzn. No questions. (Representatives Fritzier and Doyle entered the hearing room at this point, 11: 15 a. M.) 
Mr. Vm.nn. Mr. Frazier?
Mr. FftAEIER. No questions.
Mr. VELn. Mr. Doyle 
Mr. Dosr E. Yes- I do have, it it is my time to ask a question. 
Mrs. Macia, at the time you made some of your testimony I made notes on some of it, but do I understand that you attended these Commie cells in Los Angeles as late as January 1949
Mrs. MACTA. No; I don't think I attended after November 1948.
Mr. DoYLE. And those cells that you have related were active as late as that; were they? 
Mrs. MACIA. They were.
Mr. DoYLE. At least to your knowledge they were active that late and then they have been active later than that, as far as you know
Mrs. MACIA. As far as I know; yes.
Mr. DOYLE. You think they were, as far as you know?
Mrs. MACIA. They showed no inclination to disband.
Mr. DoYLE. Why, if you know, were the five members transferred to the 30th Street unit?
Mrs. MACIA. Well, because that group was becoming too unwieldy, there were too many members.
Mr. DomE. You said thig-I think this was your exact wording: "Allen, whose real name was Stone, he had revolutionary ideas." Do you remember so saying?
Mrs. MACTA. Well, lie was always advising the group to rise up and fight and gain members, and prepare themselves to be ready when the dav came. When was that big day to come? 4i fr.DoyL.
Mrs. MACIA. Well, he didn't say.
Mr. DOYLE. You said he addressed the group many times?
Mrs. MACIA. He did.
Mr. DomE. And when you said he had revolutionary ideas and told them to rise up, what sort of a revolution did he advocate or speak of?
Mrs. MACTA. They seemed to understand what it was all about. I didn't.
Mr. DOYLe. Did they discuss in their meetings the work of the United States Congress through the Un-American Activities Com. mittee?
Mrs. MACIA. It was touched on very lightly.
Mr. DoyhE. And I understood you to say that this man Stone, his real name being Stone, as far as you know, said: "So, women, rise up and infiltrate synagogues and churches."
Mrs. MACIA. And homes, wherever two women were gathered together.
Mr. Dovtz. What was the response of the women to that word? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TIO LOS ANOELES AIEA 583 
Mrs%MACIA. They seeMed to think it was the proper thing to do. 
Mr. Doytax. Wei, to your knowledge did they state or Idicate that they would do that or try to do that
Mrs. MACIA. I don't know.
Mr. l)oyi,E. You didn't know whether they actually did anything following his advocacy of that?
Mrs. MACIA. No. 
Mr. l)oyt. I think, Mr. Chairman, while I have done it before, in connection with this witnen' testimony that this man Stone had revolutionary ideas and advocated it openly and addressed the group many times advocating revolution and the group seemed to understand what he meant, that I want again to just call to the attention of the group that may he listening and for the record this one paragraph of lPullic Law 831 of the 8ist Congress, which deals with this subject of the world Communist movement, and I read Public Law 831, 81st Congress, chapter 1024, 2d session, section 2: Nevcealty for legilation. As a result of evidence adduced before varlouR cominittees of the Hennte and the Ifouse of Itepresentativen, the Congress hereby finds that there exists a worldwide Communist moventhent which In Its origin, ita development, and Its present practice Is a worllwide revolutionary movement whose purpose Im hy treachery anti deceit Infiltration Into other groups, governmental and otherwise, espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other means that may he nmessary to bring about it Comninist totalitarian dictatorship throughout the world through the medium of worldwide Communist organization. I want to ask one more question. Was there any effort with any of these Commie cells that you were theoretically a member of in the performance of. your, patriotic duty, for which I wish to compliment you, and compliment you very earnestly and sincerely; was there any effort to urge work among young people, school children, high-school children, college stu(lents? DIo you recall any?
Mrs. MACIA. Not that I know of. They did sell the books to young mothers to take home for the little children, to take home to read them nursery rhymes, and so forth, that were truly communistic.
Mr. DOTLH. When you say they were children's books, was that what I understood?
Mrs. MACIA. And nursery rhymes.
Mr. DoEr. Do you have a sample of those?
Mrs. MACIA. No; I am sorry I do not. I took home the one I bought and burned it in my fireplace, because I didn't want it.
Mr. DomE. In other words, you tell me that those nursery rhymes were entirely different?
Mrs. MACIA. They were based on the same nursery rhymes that we know, but they were entirely different from the ones that we learned.
Mr. DoYLE. In what way different?
Mrs. MACIA. It would be hard for me to tell you. 
Mr. DoYLE. Well, you said they were communistic.
Mrs. MACIA. Yes; they were written for the Communist Party's children.
Mr. DovLE. At what age level would these children's booksguch as the one you burned up-be attractive? In other words, w, at age children would these Communist nursery rhymes reach,#
Mr. MACIA. It was baby rhymes like A Little Birdie in the Tree, and so forth. 584 OMMUNI1'P A(ViiVl'IKN IN TiJlQ IOM ANORIIA AII'7A MIr. CAIIY. YOO Inli1a they Welt 1id tlRy 1111(t0 H01110 (,0VOt , tyll of oormtlol fit their smi1 1e.tr. ft,

Mr. CLRDYw. How do you spell your last name 
Mr. LusuaR. Lusher, L-u-s-h-e-r. 
Mr. TAvENNER. Are you accompanied by counselI
Mr. LusitER. I am, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel please identify himself for the record I
Mr. MAIROLM My name is Ben Margolis.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. LusherI
Mr. LusnER. Cleveland, Ohio, April 1913.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation ?
Mr. Lvsn. Union organizer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Pardon me?
Mr. L1si[ER. Union organizer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been ?
Mr. Lustim. Mr. Tavenner I will answer these questions, but I would like to say I am most reluctant to do so, because I don't like to hell? this committee, no matter how indirectly, to carry out its attack against academic freedom.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, it is quite apparent that you don't want to help the committee, but I am asking you to do it as far as you feel you can.
Mr. LusHER. I went to grade school in Cleveland, Ohio, high school in Los Angeles, and UCLA for about 3 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee, please, a record of your employment since 1940 F
Mr. LUSHER. In 1940 I was employed as a clerical worker at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. Since then I have been-in 1941 I became a union organizer and I have been a union organizer except for shortly less than a year which I spent in the Army in 1945.
Mr. WAurR. I suppose when you said that you were also aware of the fact that a member of this committee wrote the Government contract law ?
Mr. LUSHER. I was not aware that he was the author.
Mr. WALTER. So that when you address your remarks to the committee you will probably say with the exception of those members of the committee who have made substantial contributions to the American way, toward the betterment and improvement of working-class people.
Mr. Lusn R. Well Mr. Walter, I have seen this committee on many occasions turn up I don't believe coincidentally, at a time when groups of workers were Aighting for higher wages and were in the middle of a crucial strike, and in so doing assist the employers in holding their employees down in terms of their wages and working conditions.
Mr. WALTzR. That, sir, is absolutely untrue, because in every instance when a Communist or one who has been believed 'to be in the .Co.munistParty who) incidentally, was employed with a labor organization has been subpenaed before this committee and requested a postponement because of a conflict, the request has been granted. That is the record of this committee.
Mr. DomL. That is correct. I join in the statement [that of Congressman Wsilter], and your [that of the witness] statement, sir, is absolutely false. I know that. I live in. Los Angeles County myself.
Mr. JAcKsom Proceed, Mr. Counsel. 
Mr. L auza. My information, gentlemen, is contrary. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 593 
Mr. DoYLe. Your information is, I know, not founded in fact. 
Mr. JACKSON. Proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Screen Office Employees' Guild in 1044? 
Mr. LUSHER. Mr. Tavenner, I must decline to answer that question, and I should like to explain my reasons for so declining. I shall be brief. My first reason is that the Constitution and Bil [of Rights of the United States was written by a Congress which was interested in protecting the civil rights and freedom of the American people, and I do not choose by cooperating with this particular group of Congressmen to tear down what the other Congressmen built up. My second reason is that I believe this committee to be illegal and to be pursuing an illegal objective, because the congressional committees are supposedly set up to gather facts for introduction of leislation, and since the purpose of this committee itself interferes with a freedom of speech and association and of religion, and since the Constitution prohibits such restriction, this committee can have no legal objective. "Thirdly, I believe this committee has assisted employers, as I have said, in holding down wages and working conditions, and since I am a union man a trade unionist, I believe that to help this committee would be to elp this committee accomplish its job of union busting. Fourth, I base my declination to answer on the first amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech, association, religion, and assembly, and I believe that your inquiry into my beliefs and into my association is prohibited under that section of the Constitution. Finally, and particularly, I base my declination to answer on the fifth amendment to the Constitution, which gives me a right to refuse to testify against myself. I would like, in the course of calling or standing upon the rights guaranteed to me by the fifth amendment to refuse to testify against myself, to call the attention of this committee to someone who is probably the best known figure in the world, who has set down something which perhaps is similar to the fifth amendment, and although I am Jewish, I refer to Jesus Christ, and I would like to quote, a very short quote, which I think will indicate that the fifth amendment is not something new. This is a quote from Mark 25: 24, and I quote from the Bible: And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest It. And the chief priests accused film of many things; but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. And that is the end of the quote, Mr. Tavenner. 
Mr. CLA"r. Did you ever hear a Communist cite any section of the Bible? [Laughter.]
Mr. LUSHEI. I must decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated, Mr. Congressman.
Mr. JAcxso. The witness must be given a hearing by the committee. Please give no demonstration of approval or disapproval

Mr. Lvaimat. Mr. T1avenner, I have ntever held it position fit the union which required me to sign these affidavits. 
Mr. TAvFNxR. On what do you base that statement I (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LusitzR. Mr. Tavenner I have not been. an officer of a union and my understanding of the Tah-Hartley law is only officers of unions are required to comply with that section of the law. 
Mr. WALTHR. That is right. 
Mr. TAVENNEIt. So your position is that as an organizer; you were not the type of officer or not an officer who is required to sign a TaftHatley itf(ladit. (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LUs n. I was not required to sign a Toft-Hartley affidavit because of my position.
Mr. TAVzNNFR. Mr. Chairman, this is very close to the problem that the committee considered and made a recommendation to Congress on a year or more ago, where the Army and Navy, In construing the security, various security laws concluded that an officer of a union did not have to be cleared Nher tint union was engaged in defense contracts, where the Atomic Energy Commission, in construing the laws applicable to it, construed the law so as to require all officers of a union to be cleared.
Mr. WALTmR. But there is a difference in the language in the Atomic Energy Act. There is a difference.
Mr AVaxw. That is right.
Mr. WAvr. That is the difference.
Mr. TA wNER. That is why I am pointing the matter out. The language is different in all the acts.
Mr. Cr mY. And because you think, Mr. Tavenner, there may be some necessity for an amendment to the statuteMr. TAvwiiN. It may be just as important that an organier for a union be required to sign the Taft-Hartley affidavit as it would be for the president of a local. In fact, the organizer may have even not certain about ,mater powers than the president of the local. I am line. r.WALTER. Mr. Tavenner, the law is well understood along that
Mr. C ARDY. Your point being there may be some need for a recommendation for legislation along-that line f
Mr. TAvzN. Certainly it is a matter to be considered. Were you a member of the Communist Party at any time while you were on organizer I (At this point Mr.Lusher conferred with Mr.Margolis.) Air. LusHm. Mr. Tavenner I will answer no questions of that character. I stand upon all oi the reasons previously given, includ. ing the fifth amendment to the Constitution.

Mr. Lusxi. Same answer.
Mr. TAvF.mm. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. CLARDY. I want to pursue 1 angle a little further. Are you at the moment an organizer for some union I COMMt AfrV rST S m T=N os ANONLU AsBA 597 
Mr. Lusum. I am unemployed at the moment. 
Mr. CLARDY. Since when did you cease to be an organizer fors union, if you have actually ceased#
Mr. LusEn. Today.
Mr. CLARDY. This morning? 
Mr. Lusnzia. That is right. Was that a voluntary severance?
Mr. Lusuwt. That is right, I resigned some time ago, effective as of today. (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. CLARDY. 
Mr. CLARDY. Do you expect to resume as an organizer after this hearing is over? No, I do not. What was the name of the union? (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred with Mr. Margolis.) 
Mr. LUBHE. 
Mr. CLARDY. 
Mr. LusimR. I am sorry, I didn't hear your question. I would like to say, by the way, these -hearings have had absolutely nothing to do with my resignation, which was submitted considerably in advance of these hearings, or subpenas to these hearings.
Mr. CLARDY. You are not charging us with anything in connection with that, then?
Mr. LusnER. No.
Mr. CLARDY. What was the name of the union you last served as an organizer? 
Mr. Lusi ER. I must decline to answer that question upon all the grounds I previously stated. 
Mr. CLARw. I again ask the witness be directed to answer, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. JACKSON. Not being clear in my recollection whether that direction has been given on that question, I will direct the witness.
Mr. LusHER. I must decline to answer that question on all the grounds previously stated, including the fifth amendment to$the Constitution.
Mr. CLAmY. Do I correctly understand your prior statement to be, no matter how far I may pursue that line of inquiry concerning your past connections, you will refuse to answer on the same grounds ? that will shorten this. (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LusrnR. I am not quite sure I understand your question.
Mr. CLARDY. Maybe I didn't understand you. I understood you a moment ago to tell Mr. Tavenner you would decline to answer any further questions concerning your Communist activities or your connections as a union organizer, upon the same grounds already advanced. (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred withMr. Margolis.).
Mr. CLARDY. Now I want to discover whether you are going to continue to do that, so I may not be bothering you with further questions. (At this point Mr. Lusher conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LuslIER. Mr. Clardy, no matter how many ways you ask me what unions I have been associated with or organizer for or member of, I will continue to refuse to answer for the reasons I have previously enumerated.
Mr. CLARDY. I thought that was what your answer was, but I wanted it clear in the record. That is all.

Mr. MADDOW. I was born in Passaic N. J., in 1901.
Mr. TAvUNIM Where do you reside
Mr. MADDow. I reside in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAvsw'NE What is your occupation
Mr. MADoow. I am a writer.
Mr. TAvummrma. Would you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been?
Mr. MADrow. Well, after grammar and high school in my home town, I attended Columbia University for 4 years.
Mr. TAvNNER. When did you complete your training at Columbia University I
Mr. MADDOW. In 1930.
Mr. TAVENNE. What?
Mr. M"Dow. 1980. How have you been employed since that time, since
Mr. TAVENErx. 1980,J mean in a general way? Just describe it in a general way.
Mr. MADDOW. I was unemployed for about 2 years from 1930 to about 1932, and then the following 3 years I spent as an orderly in a hospital in New York. Te 3 years following I spent as an employee of the Emergency Relief Bureau in New York iy.
Mr. TAvENE. When did you come to California?
Mr. MADDOW. I think the first time I saw California was from a troop train, but I was employed hereMr.TAvEiNm. Proceed and tell us how you were employed in New York before you came to California.
Mr. MADDow. I think I left my employment in the Emergency Re- lief Bureau in about 1938, world be my estimate, and between that time and my entry into the Army I was a free-lance writer and did a considerable amount of work in industrial and documentary films, small films.
Mr. TAVEmNE. And when did you come to California for the purpose of resuming your work as a writer?
Mr. MADDOW. Upon my discharge from the Army, which was in October of 1945.
Mr. TAvENxxn. How have you practiced your profession since that date, in what way ? As a free-lance writer or screen writer or what?
Mr. MArow. i have been a screen writer during the major portion of that time.
Mr. TAv NNR. What have been some of your principal screen credits?
Mr. MADDow. To go back to the earliest one, I worked for Columbia Pictures. I wrote a film called Framed, I think was the name of it, if I remember correctly The second film in which I had a credit, I think it was a split credit, was A Man From Colorado, a Western. COMMUMST AOTI P9s IN THE wS ANOaLES AREA 601 Two subsequent films were Intruder In the Dust, and a split credit on Asphal t Jungle. ehlowin this I did two screenplays for Columbia again. On neither of tse screenplays, however, do I have credit at present, so it is probably pointless to mention it.
Mr. TAvENNEz.
Mr. Maddow, you know, I suppose, that the committee has been engaged for some time in an investigation of the Communist infiltration Into the amusement field, with special emphasis upon the moving pictures, for the purpose of determining what the real objectives of the Communist Party have been in that field, and what they have accomplished, including the extent of infiltration and their methods of operation, and we trust that you will give this committee the benefit of any knowledge that you have on that subject.
Mr. MADDOW. I don't understand. Is that a question, Mr. TavennerI
Mr. TAvYNNER. I am asking you now for your cooperation In telling the committee all you know about the operations of the Communist Party in this area if you have any knowledge of it. Would you do soI
Mr. MADDOW. If 7ou will address to me a specific question, I will endeavor to answer it.
Mr. TAvENNER. I was afraid of that. In the course of our investiation, sworn testimony was taken on March 12, 1953, of Pauline wanson Townsend, and she admitted her former Communist Party membership, explained the circumstances under which she left the party, an during her testimony regarding the operations of the party as she observed it, the following questions and answers occurred:
Mr. WnEiLE.m Will you Identify the Individuals that you met as Communists, in the first group? That was the first group of the Communist Party to which she herself had been assigned.
Mrs. ToWNSEND. Ben and Norma Barzman, Jay and Sondra Gorney, Pauline Lauber Finn, Ring Lardner, Alice Hunter, Bill Pomerance, Meta Rels, Richard Collins, Lewis ' Allen, Ben Bengal, John Weber.
Mr. WaLzim. How long were you In the first group, Mrs. Townsend?
Mrs. TOwIsInn. A year and a halt.
Mr. WHEELEn. Did you hold any office In this group?
Mrs. To'wrsmz. At one time I was chairman. Also, I recall Ben Maddow. Now, was she correct in identifying you as one of that group of the Communist Party of which she was a memberI (At this point Mr. Maddow conferred with Mr. Tietz.)
Mr. MADDOW. Mr. Tavenner, I will decline to answer that question on the rights and privileges afforded me both by the first amendment and by the fifth.
Mr. TAvEiJNE. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Pary?
Mr. MADDOW. I will decline to answer that on the grounds previously cited.
Mr. TAvENNE.. I have no further questions.
