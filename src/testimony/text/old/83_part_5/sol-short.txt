Mr. SHOR. Sol Shor.
Mr. WHEELER. VWhen and where were you born?
Mr. Siron. In New York City, July 16, 1913.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your educational background?
Mr. SHOR. I was educated in the public schools in New York and went to the College of the City of New York at night for about two and a half years and then went to New York University, from which school I graduated in 1937.
Mr. WHIEELER. What is your present occupation?
Mr. SHOR. I am a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. How have you been employed since your graduation from New York University?
Mr. SHOR. I moved from New York to California with my family in 1937. First I got a job on the back lot at Republic Pictures and later became a writer, and since then have been working as a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. What are your screen credits ?
Mr. SHOR. Mainly at Republic Pictures and Columbia Pictures. The titles are mainly serial titles, like Dick Tracy, the Lone Ranger, Zoro.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently employed ?
Mr. SHOR. No; I am working on a free-lance basis now.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I have.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first join the Communist Party ?
Mr. SHOR. I believe that it was sometime in 1938. a Released by the committee. SSol Shor was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 924 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. What were the events leading up to your member- ship?
Mr. SHOR. I believe that I became interested in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League during that period, and somehow through my attendance at meetings there I was induced to attend a group in current events. I don't remember whether this was a pay group or not. From there I went to a group that was to prepare for recruiting into the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Who solicited your membership into the Communist Party, do you recall?
Mr. SHOR. Well, as I recall, there was one person I knew at that time by the name of Michael Alexander, and I think he was the one that got me to take this current events class.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was Michael Alexander?
Mr. SnoR. He was working either as a cutter or assistant cutter or in the messenger department at Republic Pictures at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, was he known to you as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. No.
Mr. WHEELER. But he did suggest that you attend theMr. SHOR. Current events from which the recruitments were made for this other group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Alexander attend the current events group or the study group ?
Mr. SHOR. No, he didn't.
Mr. WHEELER. However, he did make arrangements for you to attend?
Mr. SHOR. No, he just suggested this current events group, since I was apparently interested in world affairs, through my interest in the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.
Mr. WHEELER. But still he would be the individual who made arrangements for you to attend, isn't that correct?
Mr. SHoR. Actually, I am trying to recall now what procedure took place for the enrollment, whether he was actually the one that enrolled me or whether he just suggested this group that met, this current events group.
Mr. WHEELER. He would have to suggest you see somebody in this group to get you started ?
Mr. SHOR. That is right, in this current events group.
Mr. WHEELER. Therefore, he would be instrumental in getting you into the group.
Mr. SHOR. Yes. Actually, as I say, I don't know whether he was an official in this current events or group or not at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Now, how many meetings did you attend of this current events group? Approximately.
Mr. SHOR. I should imagine it was about a dozen meetings. It was a complete course, sort of, that went over a period of about 3 months. As well as I can recall, we used to meet one evening a week.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where the meetings were held?
Mr. SHOR. They were held at various people's houses, but right now I don't think I can recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the individuals who attended these discussion groups? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 925 
Mr. SHOR. This is really very vague in my mind.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party while you attended this discussion group ?
Mr. SHOE. No. This was kind of a preliminary paving of the way, apparently, for indoctrination into the second group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructor was of this group?
Mr. SHOR. I remember the instructor of the second group was a Sam Silver. But this first groupMr. WHEELER. How long after you became a member of the discussion group were you asked to become a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOn. Then I went into this preliminary group that made possible my entrance into the Communist Party. And I attended meetings at this group which Sam Silver was an instructor of for about 12 weeks.
Mr. WHEELER. What I am trying to get at is when you joined the party.
Mr. SHOR. This was at the end of the second group.
Mr. WHEELER. At the end of the second group ?
Mr. SHOR. That is right. That also lasted about 10 or 12 meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Sam Silver as being the discussion leader in the second group?
Mr. SHOE. In the second group.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, how many individuals comprised the second group?
Mr. SHOR. I imagine there must have been between 8 and 10 in that second group.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party when you attended the second group ?
Mr. SHORT. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the individuals who attended this second group with you?
Mr.SHoR. I remember it was held at the house of Blanche Cole. I believe she is a sister of Lester Cole.
Mr. WHEELER. Lester Cole?
Mr. SHOR. Lester Cole.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Lester Cole present?
Mr. SHORT. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was present ?
Mr. SHOR. It is sort of a blank right there, because I don't remember any of these people being in any group I went into later on.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Now, you have stated at the conclusion of your attendance of the second discussion group you became a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. SHOR. Yes, at the last meeting the pitch was made, asking those who wanted to join to join up.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was instrumental in soliciting your membership in the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Well, it came as a result of this Sam Silver, who was the instructor. Actually, he was the one who made the pitch at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. At this time you signed up as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. That is right, at the end of this second discussion group. 926 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall anyone else who signed up as a member of the Communist Party at the same time you did.
Mr. SHOE. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you subsequently assigned to a group of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this first group ?
Mr. SHOR. Well, this first group, I remember I attended one big meeting where there were a lot of people whom I didn't know, since this was brand new to me, and immediately after this first meeting I was moved into a very small group, consisting of about 5 or 6 people.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the first group ?
Mr. SHOR. That must have been about maybe a year.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, do you recall the names of the individuals who were members of this first group ?
Mr. SHOR. There were the two people. Lillian-he is a business manager now.
Mr. WHEELER. IS it Lillian and Bernard Skadron?
Mr. SHOR. That is right. There was a girl of Finnish descent in the group, whose name I do not know. Harold Salemson.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of this group?
Mr. SHOE. No, I don't think I can. I don't think I can call the sixth person. But these 4 I remember definitely as part of the group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was the head of this group, the chairman?
Mr. SHOR. I think it was Lillian, either Lillian or Bernie Skadron.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay dues?
Mr. SHOR. At that time I did, yes; I did pay dues.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. SHOE. I may have paid them to Bernie Skadron.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this group classified as a motion-picture industry group, a talent group, or more or less a neighborhood group?
Mr. SHOR. I don't know whether they classified it at that time, because I was the only writer in the group. Mrs. Skadron, I think, was a housewife at the time, Lillian Skadron. Bernie Skadron was an accountant, I believe. Harold Salemson was a representative of magazines, as far as I could remember, publicity or a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. On how many occasions would you say you saw
Mr. Salemson present at these Communist Party meetings?
Mr. SHOR. He wasn't too regular an attendant. We used to meet sometimes once every week and sometimes once every second week, and I imagine he would be there, oh, about 50 percent of the time.
Mr. WHEELER. He was, however, a dues-paying member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I imagine he was.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, were you subsequently transferred to a second group?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I was.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you give us the approximate date?
Mr. SHOR. Let's see, I joined sometime in 1938. This lasted through 1939, and it must have been possibly sometime in 1939 that COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 927 I was transferred to a second group. This I believe was considered more of a talent group.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the second group?
Mr. SHOR. I believe I was a member of the second group for about 6 months and then went into a third group before I went into the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. On what date did you enter the United States Army?
Mr. SnHO. Pearl Harbor was December 1941. I was inducted in February of 1941. About 10 months before Pearl Harbor.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were members of the second group?
Mr. SHOR. The second group-there was, I think, Salemson was a part of this second group also. There was Edward Eliscu. I am trying to separate the second and the third groups. I think Mickey Uris was in this group. There may have been Morton Grant in this group at that time. I remember the third group more clearly because that was closest to my entrance in the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. How many members would you say were in the second group ?
Mr. SHOR. I imagine about 10 that I saw at various times.
Mr. WHEELER. Were they all writers in the motion-picture industry?
Mr. SHOR. I should imagine that all of them were writers, that this 'was purely a writers' group at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall who was the chairman of this group ?
Mr. SHOR. No, I don't think I could.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. SHOR. I know it wasn't Eliscu. My memory on that is not too clear.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, prior to your entrance in the Army, you say you were in a third group?
Mr. SHOR. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members of the third group were? 
Mr. SHOR. Yes. In the third group there was Lester Koenig. There was a Nicholas Bela. I believe Eliscu was also a member of this group. A fellow by the name of Rivers, I believe-he didn't work in pictures. I think he was a novelist.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that be W. L. Rivers, or Les Rivers?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, Les Rivers. I believe Mortimer Offner was a member of this group.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the total number of individuals in this group?
Mr. SHOR. I think that was about the biggest group I attended. I think there were about 12, I would imagine. Now, there was one I ran across, a Trivers, Paul Trivers. I recall the name. A tall, darkhaired fellow. I don't remember whether he was in the third group or the second one.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the chairman was of the third group?
Mr. SHOR. The chairman of the third group I believe was this Nicholas Bela.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues? 928 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SHOR. It may have been his wife, who was also a member of that group. She was a housewife or she may have been a writer, I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her given name
Mr. SHOR. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Were the wives of any of the other individuals you mentioned in the groups?
Mr. SHOR. No, just this Nicholas Bela's wife. Maybe it is because we used to meet at his house occasionally-not occasionally. I think most of the time this group met at his house in Westwood some place.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified you entered the Army in February of 1941.
Mr. SHOR. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you discharged from the Army?
Mr. SHOR. The end of October in 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you receive an honorable discharge?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, I did.
Mr. WHEELER. What branch of service were you in?
Mr. SHOR. I was in the Signal Corps, United States Army.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you stationed?
Mr. SHOR. When I was first inducted as a private I was stationed at Fort Francis E. Warren in Cheyenne, Wyo., with the Quartermaster Corps, where I was assistant to the public relations director of the pst. Then on orders from Washington I was transferred to Fort Monmouth Motion Picture Division. I remained with the motion picture division after it had moved to Astoria, Long Island.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your rank at the time of discharge?
Mr. SHOR. I was a first lieutenant. I went to the Signal Corps Officer Cadet School at Fort Monmouth, where I secured my commission.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you still retain a commission with the United States Army ?
Mr. SHOR. No, I am on the Inactive Reserves.
Mr. WHEELER. But you still have your commission?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, that remains with me.
Mr. WHEELER. After you were released from the Army, did you return to Hollywood?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I returned to Hollywood in November of 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. While you were in the United States Army, did you participate in any Communist activities?
Mr. SHOR. No, I didn't.
Mr. WHEELER. After your return to Hollywood, did you renew your affiliation with the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Yes. It was in around 1946, I believe, when I rejoined the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the mechanics involved in your reaffiliation with the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Let's see, it was through OffnerMr. WHEELER. Mortimer Offner?
Mr. SHOR. Yes that I was again reintroduced or sort of reattached to a group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Offner contact you personally?
Mr. SHOR. I think it was a kind of a mutual thing.
Mr. WHEELER. However, through Mr. Offner you were reassigned to another group in the Communist Party? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 929 
Mr. SHOR. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. This would be the fourth group ?
Mr. SHOR. That is correct. 
Mr. WHEELER. Whas this a group comprised of so-called talent group in Hollywood?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, this was again mainly writers.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the fourth group?
Mr. SHOR. I was a member of the fourth group until I moved to the valley, where I purchased a home.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you give us the approximate date?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, this was through the year of '46, and I moved to my new home in February of '47.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were members of this fourth group ?
Mr. SHOR. In the fourth group there was Michael Wilson, Herbert Biberman, I believe Carl Foreman, a fellow by the name of White.
Mr. WHEELER. Could that be Irving White'? 
Mr. SHOR. Irving White. Ray Spencer. That reminds me, Ray Spencer was somebody whom I had known as a member of one of the groups previously.
Mr. WHEELER. What is Mr. Spencer's occupation?
Mr. SHOR. I believe he was a writer. I believe Mickey Uris was a member of this group, and Bernard Vorhaus. Paul Trivers may have been in this group, also.
Mr. WHEELER. You did know Paul Trivers as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. Prior to my entrance into the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the total number of members in this group?
Mr. SHoR. The most I saw at any one meeting were about, I think, between 9 and 10.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was the head of this group, the chairman?
Mr. SHOR. The chairman of this group I think shifted between Biberman and Mike Wilson.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom you paid your dues?
Mr. SHOR. It may have been Irving White.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, you have testified that in February 1947 you changed your residence.
Mr. SHOR. That is correct. 
Mr. WHEELER. And because of this change of residence you were assigned to another group.
Mr. SHOR. In the valley.
Mr. WHEELER. In the San Fernando Valley ? 
Mr. SHOR. Yes, that is right. In North Hollywood, that is.
Mr. WHEELER. This would be a different group of which you were a member?
Mr. SHOR. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did you remain a member of the fifth group?
Mr. SHOR. I remained a member of it until my disassociation from the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. When was your disassociation? 930 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. SHOE. Well, I could say that spiritually my disassociation started somewhere in 1948. And either toward the end of '48 or early '49 I physically separated myself from the party. To explain this a little more fully, I began to attend fewer and fewer meetings during the period of '48, because I had begun to have this fight within myself with regard to my attachment.
Mr. WHEELER. We will go into that in just a minute. Do you recall who the members of the fifth group were?
Mr. SHOR. Yes. The fifth group I believe was about the largest group I was a member of, and it later split up into 2 groups. It was still apparently the same group. In the fifth group there were Lester Cole, John Howard Lawson, I remember at the first few meetings of this large group, a fellow by the name of ManoffMr. WHEELER. Arnold Manoff?
Mr. SHOR. Arnie Manoff, that sounds right. Morton Grant, Al Levitt, Carl Foreman, and Mortimer Offner. Sanford-Mr. WHEELER. John Sanford?
Mr. SHOR. John Sanford. Betty Wilson, Melvin Levy.
Mr. WHEELER. John Weber?
Mr. SHOR. No. If I recall in our last interview I believe I said John Weber, but it was his wife that belonged to this group. John Weber was not part of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall John Weber's wife's given name?
Mr. SHOE. Ruth, I believe. George Beck was a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mrs. Beck a member of that group?
Mr. SHOE. I don't recall having seen her at any meetings. I believe we met at his house once or twice very early in that time, that I was transferred to that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Leopold Atlas a member of this group?
Mr. SHoR. Leopold Atlas I remember seeing at either 1 or 2 meetings very early in my attachment to that group. After those 1 or 2 meetings I never saw him again. Anne Froelich was a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall anyone else?
Mr. SHOR. Tom Chapman was a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Tom Chapman's occupation?
Mr. SHOE. I believe he was a reader. Just going back, this goes, way back. There was a director Tuttle, Frank Tuttle. This was back in, I believe, the second group that I was a member of. I remember Henry Meyers, a writer, as a member of the Communist Party, who was in one of the groups prior to my entrance in the Army. Ring Lardner, Jr. That was prior to my entrance in the Army. Hugo Butler was in one of the groups after I came out of the Army, in that first group. Maurice Rapf was before I went into the Army. I remember him in one of the groups prior to my entrance in the Army. Waldo Salt, that was prior to my entrance in the Army. There is a name I recall, Madelaine Ruthven, not as a member of the Communist Party but as either an assistant or one who was directly responsible for my signing the card initially from that second discussion group. I recall Jessie Burns as being in one of the discussion groups just prior to my entrance in the Communist Party. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 931 Clarice Chapman was in the last group, which I have called the Valley group.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you further identify Clarice Chapman?
Mr. SHOR. I believe she is the wife of Tom Chapman.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she employed in the motion-picture industry or was she typified as a housewife?
Mr. SHOE. I don't believe she was employed in pictures at the time. There is a name that rings a bell and I think this is part of the first group that I ever attended. There was a George, I believe it was George Hellgren, and I think he went back to Sweden or something.
Mr. WHEELER. George Hellgren was in one of your earlier groups? 
Mr. SHOR. The first one. early meetings. He was only there for a couple of the 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall Mr. Hellgren's occupation? 
Mr. SHOR. It wasn't in motion pictures, I don't believe. 
Mr. WHEELER. I believe Mr. Hellgren was credit manager at Fox Studios. Does that refresh your memory?
Mr. SHOE. He may have been in some kind of business end of it.
Mr. WHEELER. His wife's name is Nora Hellgren. 
Mr. SHOR. There is a Nora Hellgren listed right under here. Are they Swedish?
Mr. WHEELER. I don't know. 
Mr. SHOE. Somehow I vaguely recall they went back to live in Sweden.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Nora Hellgren a member of this group?
Mr. SHOR. No; it was just George. That may have been the other person in that first group. Josef Mischel was a member, I believe, of the group I was in after I came back from the Army. Here is a name I recall. Dorothy Comingore, but not as a member of the Communist Party, but a member of the first study group I was in. It may have been at that time Dick Collins was also a member of that group.
Mr. WHEELER. Dorothy Comingore was known to you as Dick Col- lins' wife ?
Mr. SHOR. I don't know whether they were married at that time or not.
Mr. WHEELER. They were subsequently married ? 
Mr. SHOE. Yes. In the last group there was a David Robison. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Mr. Robison's occupation? 
Mr. SHOE. I don't recall whether he was a reader at the time or a writer. Maurice Clark is one of the names I recall as being in the group I went into after I came out of the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. The first group you went into after you got out of the Army?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Shor, would you advise the committee the rea- sons why you severed your relationship with the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOE. Well, when I came out of the Army, and probably the thing that brought me back into it was perhaps the still idealistic interest and hope that maybe this was the right answer to the things that I though were politically and socially inequitable in the country at the time. 932 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA However, after a year in which I found that I was ordered to adhere to certain things, that is, if I disagreed, my disagreement meant nothing-in other words, you had to succumb to the general trend of thought and policy of the Communist Party as dictated from somewhere up above, and that to me absolutely ran against the grain. I felt that all the things that were being said about the Communist Party were more and more true, that it was more the tail of a kite that was flown somewhere in Moscow and this was just another appendage of it. It wasn't American in any sense of the term. It wasn't a truly free third party in the tradition of American third parties. My feeling was that since-such an overwhelming majority of the people, including many leading, honorable citizens of the country, felt this party was not for the best interests of the American people, that these doubts that began to assail me finally crystallized, that this S party was inequitable to the best interest of the American people and was inequitable to the democratic tradition of the American people, and it was something I didn't want to be associated with any longer and I felt any of my associations in the past had been a grave error, a mistake in thinking, probably thinking in which I was led by the nose by others without trying to think things out for myself.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall in 1939 Stalin and Hitler entered into a pact, a nonaggression pact?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, I do.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe from your previous testimony you stated one of the reasons you joined the Communist Party was because of your interest in fighting nazism.
Mr. SHOR. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you accept the Stalin-Hitler pact?
Mr. SHOR. As best I can recall, this was a great shock to me, but as I say, at that time my thinking was dominated by others. And even though I remember at the time trying to argue against this feeling that it wasn't right, that making an alliance with nazism at the time was merely aiding nazism. However, the thinking of the other people in the group that I was associated with and the thoughts which dominated were that this was the best interest for peace, and so on and so forth. I finally succumbed and fell into line and accepted this, even though my better judgment said to me that this couldn't be so at the time, that this wasn't right.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you in the Army at the time Browder was expelled from the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOR. I believe I was. It was the period of the disclosure or the writing of the letter by Duclos, which made world history at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, were you ready to accept the Duclos letter?
Mr. SI-IR. Perhaps this is one of the things, even though when I returned from the Army and I reentered the Communist Party, I think this is one of the things that subconsciously remained with me more than anything else. It showed that the Communist Party was not acting as an American entity. It wasn't acting as a third party in the democratic tradition of the United States. It was merely acting as part of a world Communist group and merely accepting orders and dictates of people who are higher up in the, I should say, COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE ,LOS ANGELES AREA 933 hierarchy of the Communist Party; that is, the world Communist Party, if such a thing exists.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party when Albert Maltz wrote his article for New Masses, wherein he appealed for freer expression among writers?
Mr. SInn. I remember there was a great stir about this. Truthfully, this was a little above my level of understanding, the ramifications of what was good Marxist writing and what wasn't good Marxist writing. I recall that there was some discussion about this, but truthfully I could not fathom exactly what this was. Again, I think this is something that gave me the feeling that the man, if he was a member of the Communist Party, couldn't express himself in his own way, but had to follow a line that -was dictated from somewhere above and that if he failed to follow this line he wasn't writing the way a good Communist should be writing.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, during the time you were a member of the Communist Party, did you ever make an attempt to introduce into scripts any Communist Party line or doctrine ?
Mr. SHOR. Well, I think from the kind of material I wrote, mainly blood and thunder thrillers, there was very little opportunity, even if I had wanted to, to introduce any Communist ideology. I don't think I was well enough versed in it myself to be able to introduce any, and my feeling was to do as good a job on a picture as I possibly could and that was it. Additionally, I would like to add this; that those first years that I worked at Republic Studios I worked in a group with 2 or 3 other writers, and anything that I worked on was a collaborating effort, and certainly I didn't use any story ideas to try to influence these other writers.
Mr. WHEELER. Who have your agents been since you have been a writer in the motion-picture industry ?
Mr. SHOR. At the present time my agent is the Jaffee Agency. Before then it was Mitchell Gertz Agency. And those were the only two.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you feel that your membership in the Communist Party assisted you in any way in your writing profession? I mean, in regard to securing employment in the studios.
Mr. SHOR. No, it didn't, as far as I know, because my first job I secured at Republic Studios after working on the back lot. There was this opening, and I had been around pestering the producers, and finally secured a job on the serial staff of writers, and I worked on the serial staff until I was inducted into the Army. After I came out of the Army I went back to work at Republic Studios again and I never secured any help of any of these people that I knew in the Communist Party in any way whatsoever to help me secure employment.
Mr. WHEELER. IS there anything else, Mr. Shor, you would like to add to the record?
Mr. SHOR. Well, I would like to add this: Since my disassociation from the Communist Party I feel much freer, as though a burden were taken off of my mind, because as I said, for some time the struggle had been going on within me, whether I was doing the right thing by still being attached to something that was so definitely opposed to American democratic tradition, and that having severed all connec- 934 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA tions and bonds with the Communist Party, I can think and conduct myself, I believe, more in the American tradition. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever have an occasion to meet Danny Dare, either as a member of the Communist Party or in study groups? 
Mr. SHOE. I believe Danny Dare was a man that I met in the second study group I was a part of, before I became a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, do you recall if he became a member of the Communist Party
Mr. SHOR. To the best of my knowledge, I don't know whether he became a member of the Communist Party. I never was in any group with him.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you acquainted with Harold Hecht?
Mr. SHOR. At present? I haven't seen him in many years.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, did you ever have an occasion to meet Harold Hecht as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHOE. Yes, in the second group that I was in.
Mr. WHEELER. Again, what are the approximate dates of your membership in the second group?
Mr. SHOR. In the second group it was around 1939, the greater part of that.
Mr. WHEELER. How long a period of time did you say you were in the second group ?
Mr. SHOR. It must have been about a year, because then I was in the third group before I went into the Army.
Mr. WHEELER. On how many occasions would you say you saw Harold Hecht in attendance at these meetings?
Mr. SHOR. I imagine I saw him about 2 or 3 times at these meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. These were closed meetings of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SHOR. Yes, at the time, they were.
Mr. WHEELER. Everybody who attended these meetings were duespaying members?
Mr. SHOn. I imagine they were.
Mr. WHEELER. You were a dues-paying member ? 
Mr. SHOR. Yes, at that time, certainly.
Mr. WHEELER. You would reach the conclusion that the other individuals in attendance were dues-paying members ?
Mr. SHOE. Certainly.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions, Mr. Shor. If you have anything in addition you would like to add to the record, anything you can think of, you have the opportunity now of saying whatever you so desire.
Mr. SHOR. I believe I have covered it all. As I say, in regard to people and events, I have gone over the past to the best of my recollection, and as to my feelings now and in the future, I think I have expressed those as fully as I can.
Mr. WHEELER. I want to take this opportunity now of thanking you for your cooperation.
Mr. SHOR- Thank vou. Mr. Wheeler.
