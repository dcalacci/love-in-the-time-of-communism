Mr. WOOD. Mr. Witness, any time during the progress of your examination you have the privilege of conferring with your counsel. 441 442 INDUSTRY 
Mr. BERCOVICI. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Bercovici, will you spell your name, please?
Mr. BERcovICI. L-e-o-n-a-r-d-o B-e-r-c-o-v-i-c-i.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been known by any other name?
Mr. BERCOVICI. In the past I have used several pen names; that was a long time ago; but not to my knowledge have I ever been known as Leonard Berkowitz, as stated on the subpena served on me.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, will you please request the witness to speak louder.
Mr. WOOD. Will you speak louder, please. We can't hear you up here.
Mr. BERCOVICI. I would like to present this birth certificate in evidence.
Mr. TAVENNER. And the reason is that the subpena served upon you stated that you were known by some other name ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. The subpena stated Leonard Berkowitz, also known as Leonardo Bercovici.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you have not been known by the name you mentioned ?
Mr. BERcovICI. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to offer the birth certificate in evidence and ask that it be marked "Bercovici Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. WooD. It will be received. (The certificate above referred to, marked "Bercovici Exhibit No. 1," is filed herewith.)
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born?
Mr. BERCOVICI. In New York City, January 4, 1908.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now reside ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I live in Westwood, Calif., 10520 Garwood Place.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please state to the committee what your educational background has been
Mr. BERCOVICI. Very briefly, I attended high school at Morristown, N. J., and went to New York University and Yale School of Drama.
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been the record of your employment since finishing school?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Since finishing school I did a considerable amount of free-lance radio work.
Mr. WooD. I didn't understand what you said. 
Mr. BERCOVICI. Since finishing school I did a considerable amount of free-lance radio work. In 1937 I came to Hollywood. From that time on, intermittently, I worked for several studios-Warner Bros.; Paramount; RKO; Sam Goldwyn; David Selznick; and several others.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say you worked for them, what did you do?
Mr. BERCOVICI. As a writer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What are some of the screen plays you have taken part in writing?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I have taken part in writing the Bishop's Wife, for Sam Goldwyn; Portrait of Jenny, for David Selznick; Kiss the Blood Off My Hands; Lost Moment; Racket Busters; and probably several others.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party ?  443 
Mr. BERCOVICI. I should like to make this clear now. I am not a member of the Communist Party or in sympathy with the beliefs of the Communist Party as I understand them. In the event my country is attacked by any country I would feel it my duty and my privilege to defend my country in any capacity that I may be called upon. As to the balance of the question regarding past membership in the Communist PartyMr. WooD. Up to this moment you have not been asked that.
Mr. BERCOVICI. That is correct.
Mr. WooD. You have just been asked if you are a member.
Mr. BERcovICI. That is true. I am sorry.
Mr. WooD. Does that cover that question?
Mr. BERCOVICI. That covers that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Richard J. Collins, also a screen writer?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate or degrade me, and it violates my privilege under the Constitution, and especially under the fifth and first amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. As I understand your contention, you assert that your answer to the question as to whether or not you are acquainted with Richard Collins might subject you to criminal prosecution, and therefore you desire the protection of the fifth amendment to the Constitution in your refusal to answer?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I stand on my privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Mr. Edward Dmytryk, a director in the moving-picture industry ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Bercovici, Mr. Collins has testified before this committee in the following manner relating to you: Question. Have you mentioned in the course of your testimony the name of Leonardo Bercovici?
Mr. COLLINS. No. I have worked with Bercovici on a film that was supposed to be about the San Francisco Conference for the OWI. Question. Will you spell the name, please?
Mr. COLLINS. B-e-r-c-o-v-i-c-i. Question. Was he known to you to be a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. COLLINS. At that time he was. Is that statement correct ?
Mr. BERCOVIOI. I decline to answer that question on the same k grounds.
Mr. WALTER. Did Mr. Collins fix the date, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. What date, Mr. Bercovici, was the San Francisco Conference, if you recall?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Oh, I believe the San Francisco Conference was in 1945.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you working, at that time or shortly there- after, on a film for the OWI, Office of War Information ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the ground that it might incriminate me or degrade me, and that it violates my privilege under the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. WooD. We still can't hear you, Mr. Bercovici.
Mr. BERCOVICI. I said I still decline to answer that question on the ground that it might incriminate or degrade me, and it violates my 81595-51-pt. 2-10 444 privilege under the Constitution, and especially under the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. What crime do you think you might be charged with? You admit you were working on a picture for the OWI.
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same ground. (Representative Morgan M. Moulder entered hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you were employed by the Office of War Infor- mation, were you not?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I was employed by the Office of War Information in 1943. I believe.
Mr. WOOD. Let the record show that Mr. Moulder of the committee is present.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you so employed in 1945 ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. No; I was not so employed in 1945.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your employment began in 1943?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Yes, and I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it terminated in 1943 as well.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your employment?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I was employed to write a script for the OWI.
Mr. TAVENNER. And what was that script? 
Mr. BERCOVICI. It was a script about Italians in America.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sign an application for employment?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I signed an applicationMr. TAVENNER. Go ahead.
Mr. BERCOVICI. I believe to the best of my knowledge I signed an application after I completed my work, actually. I am not sure of that, but that is the way my memory serves me.
Mr. WooD. You mean you were employed by the Office of War Information without signing a formal application for employment?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I believe there was some kind of a civil-service form, but it is my impression that I did not sign that until sometime after, or until the completion of that particular script I was working on.
Mr. WOOD. Did you receive compensation for your services from the Government? 
Mr. BERCOVICI. Yes; I did.
Mr. WooD. Had you received that compensation prior to the time you signed that application or form ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I believe I received it on a per diem basis.
Mr. WOOD. But you received it prior to the time you signed that application ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. To the best of my knowledge that is true.
Mr. WOOD. Who approached you on the subject of doing this work for the Office of War Information?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I don't recall exactly. The man in charge of the whole OWI Motion-Picture Division was a man called Robert Riskin, and I believe a man called Joseph KrumgoldMr. WOOD. Joseph who?
Mr. BERcOVicI. Krumgold, K-r-u-m-g-o-l-d.
Mr. WooD. Where was he located?
Mr. BERCOVICT. He at that time was working for the OWI. 
Mr. WooD. Where?
Mr. BERCOVICI. In New York City.  445 
Mr. WOOD. Was he the man who approached you about doing this work for the Office of War Information?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I don't know that he actually approached me, but I was in the building and I knew Mr. Krumgold from college, and I believe he asked if I would be interested in writing a script for OWI, and I said I was.
Mr. WOOD. You say you believe?
Mr. BERCOVICI. That is the best of my knowledge. 
Mr. WooD. And is that the way you obtained your employment?
Mr. BERCOVICI. To the best of my knowledge.
Mr. WooD. Were you approached by anyone in OWI prior to the time you gained employment other than the man you mentioned?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. VELDE. What did Robert Riskin have to do with your employ- ment with OWI?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I don't know that he had anything to do with it, but I imagine approval of all jobs had to go through Mr. Riskin, because he was in charge of the whole OWI Motion Picture Division. That is the only connection I had with Mr. Riskin.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sign an affidavit of any character when employed or while employed by the OWI relating to your past membership or present membership in various types of organizations?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I believe I signed some sort of an affidavit that may have included that statement.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sign an affidavit to the effect that you were not a member of an organization which believed in the overthrow of the United States Government?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I may have signed such a document; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. HOW did you answer that question ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. May I consult counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. BERCOVICI. To the best of my knowledge, I signed the entire document. As to the particular elements in it, I wouTd have to have my memory refreshed on it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Edward Dmytryk testified before this committee relating to you in the course of his testimony as to his attendance at Communist Party meetings. His testimony is as follows: Question. Describe each of these groups to which you were assigned.
Mr. DMYTEYK. The second group I was assigned to met in Hollywood. In this group I saw Herbert Biberman, Arnold Manoff, Mickey Uris, and Leonardo Bercovici. Did you meet with the group to which Mr. Dmytryk referred in his testimony ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the ground it may tend to incriminate or degrade me and it violates my privileges under the Constitution, and especially the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Herbert Biberman?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Arnold Manoff?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Mickey Uris? 446 INDUSTRY 
Mr. BRcovICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Bercovici, the testimony of both Mr. Collins and Mr. Dmytryk related to the year 1945. You decline to answer questions relating to your alleged Communist Party membership at that time, but you state you are not now a member of the Communist Party. When did you cease to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds as other questions.
Mr. TAVENNER. This is May 1951. Were you a member on January 1, 1950 ?
Mr. BERcovICI. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member on December 31, 1950 ?
Mr. BERcoVICI. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Today is the 16th day of May. You state you are not a member of the Communist Party today. Were you a member yesterday?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. KEARNEY. Are you a member today ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. No; I am not a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you mean to say it would degrade you to say when you ceased to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answei that question.
Mr. WALTER. Do I take it from that you think it would be degrading to state when you left the Communist Party?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Bercovici, the committee is in possession of information indicating that you were a speaker on June 12, 1945, at a meeting of the National Lawyers' Guild at the Rosslyn Hotel, Los Angeles. Do you recall that?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee is also in possession of information indicating you were a member of the American-Russian Institute; that is, of the southern California chapter. Is that correct ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer on the ground it may tend to incriminate or degrade me.
Mr. TAVENNER. There has been testimony before the committee of the effort made by certain groups within the Screen Writers' Guild to control the election of officers in 1948. The committee has information indicating you were the signer of a letter in November 1948 addressed to the members, in which you endorsed the candidacy of Lester Cole and Ring Lardner, Jr. I would like to ask you to tell the committee the circumstances under which you signed that letter, if you did sign it?
Mr. BERCOVICI. May I consult counsel, please? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time connected with the California Labor School at Los Angeles
Mr. BERCOVICI. May I consult counsel?  447 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. (The witness conferred with his counsel.) (Representative James B. Frazier, Jr., left the hearing room.)
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name appears as one of those who signed an amicus curiae brief filed with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case against John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo. I would like to ask you who requested you to sign that brief, or to join in the brief ? 
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds, that it may tend to incriminate or degrade me, and that it violates my privileges under the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke a little earlier in your testimony, Mr. Bercovici, regarding the affidavit which you signed when employed by the OWI. First I would like to ask you what the date of your employment was, when you first began your work, or first made your arrangements with OWI for employment ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I don't know the precise date, Mr. Tavenner. I be- lieve it was in the spring or summer of 1943.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a copy of personnel affidavit, Standard Form No. 47, and I will ask you to look at it and state if that is a similar affidavit to that which you signed (handing affidavit to wit- ness) ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Thank you. (After examining document and con- ferring with his counsel.) Mr. Tavenner, I don t know if this is the exact form that I signed. It is a long time ago.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will ask you to examine the affidavit again and state whether or not the affidavit which you signed contained the language appearing in paragraph marked "1"?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Mr. Tavenner, it may have been something like that, but I cannot be sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. Paragraph 1 of the affidavit to which I referred states: It shall be unlawful for any person employed in any capacity by an agency of the Federal Government whose compensation or any part thereof is paid from funds authorized or appropriated by any act of Congress to have membership in any political party or organization which advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of Government in the United States. And at the end of the affidavit is the statement thatI am not a member of any political party or organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence. (Representative James B. Frazier, Jr., returned to hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Were you a member, at the time that you became employed by the OWI, of any political party or organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the grounds that it violates my constitutional privileges, and especially under the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, that is all I have to ask at the present time. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. No questions. 448 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. I would like to ask the witness a question.
Mr. Witness, I think your answer to our counsel a while back was read from a prepared statement by you, wasn't it?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Yes, it was.
Mr. DOYLE. I refer now to the statement you read in which you said that you are not now a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. BERCOVICI. The exact language was, "I am not a member of the Communist Party."
Mr. DOYLE. And I think a part of that answer was that you would fight on the side of the United States of America if it was attacked ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I will be glad to read it again: I am not a member of the Communist Party or in sympathy with the beliefs of the Communist Party as I understand them. In the event my country is attacked by any country I would feel it my duty and my privilege to defend my country in any capacity that I may be called upon. 
Mr. DOYLE. That is the part of the statement I want to ask you a question about. Was there a period of time in recent times, or at all, when you would not have fought on the side of the United States of America ? You volunteered the statement you would now. What about a year ago, or 2 years ago, or 3 years ago, or when you were a member of the Communist Party, would you then have fought on the side of the United States of Americal I ask'you that in good faith, because you volunteered that statement. You came prepared with that statement, apparently written out, to volunteer that information to this committee. That is true, isn't it? I am asking you in good faith, as one American citizen to another: Was there a time when you were a member of the Communist Party and when you would not have fought on the side of the United States of America?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the grounds it violates my constitutional privileges under the fifth and first amendments.
Mr. DOYLE. That is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. I believe you stated you were born in 1908 ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. That is right.
Mr. FRAZIER. Did you serve in the last World War ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I did not.
Mr. FRAZIER. Where were you employed then'
Mr. BERCOVICI. During the war? 
Mr. FRAZIER. Yes.
Mr. BERCOVICI. In 1943, as I stated, I worked for the OWI. I also wrote a picture for the Army.
Mr. FRAZIER. Where are you employed now ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I am not employed now. 
Mr. FRAZIER. That is all. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Moulder.
Mr. MOULDER. In reference to counsel's question regarding the loyalty affidavit, were you a member of the Communist Party at the time you signed the loyalty affidavit when you were employed by OWI?
Mr. BERCOVICI. grounds. I decline to answer that question on the same  449 
Mr. MOULDER. In your statement you said you would defend our country in the event of an attack. Would you fight for our country in the event it became involved in any war?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I would fight for my country under any circumstances.
Mr. MOULDER. That is all.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Bercovici, I would like to go into your employment with OWI a little further. You began your employment with OWI in 1943. Do you remember approximately what time of the year?
Mr. BERcovICI. I can't be entirely sure about that. I feel it was some time in the spring or early summer. I am not quite sure.
Mr. VELDE. How long were you associated with the OWI?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I think in the general vicinity of 6 months.
Mr. VELDE. What was the salary paid you by the Government in those 6 months?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I think something like $10 a day. I am not sure it was even in the form of a salary. I think it was on some kind of per diem basis. I am not clear on that.
Mr. VELDE. Then you deny you had anything to do with writing the picture in connection with the San Francisco conference; is that right ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. May I consult counsel, please ? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. BERCOVICI. Mr. Velde, I did not deny that. I merely declined to answer whether or not I participated in that film regarding the San Francisco conference.
Mr. VELDE. Did you attend the San Francisco conference, or were you in San Francisco at the time of the conference ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. May I consult counsel? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that on the same ground.
Mr. VELDE. You mean that it may tend to incriminate you to admit that you were in San Francisco in 1945 during the peace conference, or during the San Francisco conference ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. VELDE. That is all.
Mr. WooD. General Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. When you read your prepared statement that you are not a member of the Communist Party, were the words "at present" included in that statement ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. The statement merely said "I am not a member of the Communist Party," that is all.
Mr. KEARNEY. I understood you to say you would be glad to defend your country in time of war ?
Mr. BERCOVIC. The statement was, "In the event my country is attacked by any country I would feel it my duty and my privilege to defend my country in any capacity that I may be called upon."
Mr. KEARNEY. You were not in service during the last war?
Mr. BERCOVICI. No, I was not. I was IV-F.
Mr. KEARNEY. IV-F ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. Yes, I was. 
Mr. KEARNEY. I think that is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson. 450 COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. JACKSON. I have no questions. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER. In your prepared statement did you say that you are not in sympathy with the principles of the Communist Party? What is that portion of your prepared statement?
Mr. BERCOVICI (reading) : I am not a member of the Communist Party or in sympathy with the beliefs of the Communist Party as I understand them. 
Mr. POTTER. What are the principles of the Communist Party that you disagree with?
Mr. BERcOVICI. Well, I suppose that one of the beliefs of the Communist Party is the eventual establishment of some Soviet form of government in the United States. Insofar as this may violate the rights of the individuals as we know them-freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom to write, freedom to worship-insofar as those violations are concerned, I am opposed to the beliefs of the Communist Party.
Mr. POTTER. When did you establish in your own mind the disagreement that you have just cited?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the grounds it may tend to incriminate or degrade me.
Mr. POTTER. Have you always believed that the Communist Party held the principles that you have just stated ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. PoTTER. Do you believe the Communist Party is subversive?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds. 
Mr. POTTER. Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?
Mr. BERCOVICI. No; I am not.
Mr. POTTER. Have you ever been a member ?
Mr. BERCOVICI. No; I have not.
Mr. POTTER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate or degrade me, and it violates my privileges under the Constitution, and especially under the fifth and first amendments. Mir. POTTER. In other words, you make a distinction. It doesn't tend to degrade you to tell the committee you have never been a member of the Ku Klux Klan, but you feel it does to tell the committee whether you have ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. BERCOVICI. The answer to the first question is incriminating and the answer to the second is not.
Mr. POTTER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Counsel, any further questions?
Mr. TAVENNER. Not at this time, sir. It would be satisfactory if he would let the staff know where he could be reached the rest of the day in the event we decided to recall him.
Mr. WooD. With that understanding, that you advise the clerk of the committee where you can be reached throughout the remainder of the day in the event the committee desires to contact you, you may be excused until 10: 30 tomorrow.  451 
Mr. BERCOVICI. Thank you. Mr. Tavenner, please, I would like to submit this statement to be filed with the committee. (The statement referred to was filed with the committee.) (Witness temporarily excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, there was subpenaed for appear- ance here this morning a person by the name of Mrs. Beatrice Hammer. We received yesterday a doctor's certificate relating to her, and her counsel, I understand, took the matter up with you a few days ago about her illness and her inability to be here today. I call the matter to your attention and suggest that the doctor's certificate be filed in the record of the proceedings.
Mr. WooD. We have the doctor's certificate, and it was suggested by counsel for the witness that in the event the committee decided to do so-and it is before the committee now-she will be glad to be subjected to examination by any physician the committee might designate. It appears, however, she can be before the committee in the next 30 days.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to call as the next witness Mr. Alvin Hammer.
Mr. WooD. Are you Mr. Hammer ?
Mr. HAMMER. I am.
Mr. WooD. Will you raise your right hand, please, and be sworn. You solemnly swear the evidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. HAMMER. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Have a seat, sir. TESTIMONY OF ALVIN HAMMER, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, MARTIN POPPER
