Mr. WILLNER. I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented by counsel
Mr. WILLNER. I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel please identify himself for the record? 
Mr. POPPER. Martin Popper, 160 Broadway, New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Willner, will you state your full name, please?
Mr. WILLNER. My name is George Willner, W-i-l-l-n-e-r.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born?
Mr. WILLNER. I was born in Waterbury, Conn., on September 9, 1904.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your place of residence?
Mr. WILLNER. At the moment I live in Florida.
Mr. TAVENNER. What part of Florida
Mr. WILLNER. Miami Beach.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation
Mr. WILLNER. A writers' agent.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you married?
Mr. WILLNER. I am married; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your wife's name?
Mr. WILLNER. Tiba, T-i-b-a.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state briefly for the committee your educational training for your profession?
Mr. WILLNER. My educational training wasn't particularly for my profession. I had the normal education. I went to grade school in Waterbury, Conn., and Bridgeport; high school in Waterbury. I attended night school in New York, studying accountancy, for a couple of years. I went toschool for a year in New York and learned draftsmanship. (Representative Donald L. Jackson left hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. When was that?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe I left Connecticut in 1920, to the best of my recollection. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, will you state briefly what your record of employment has been since you finished your educational training. 377 
Mr. WILLNER. Well, I had various jobs in New York--clerical, selling jobs, executive jobs. As I stated previously; I was an agent. Then I became a full partner.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by "agent"?
Mr. WILLNER. I was a writers' agent in Hollywood. 
Mr. WooD. The acoustics in this room are not too good. Would you mind elevating your voice a little so we can hear you up here.
Mr. WILLNER. I will try to.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state what your clerical, selling, and exec- utive positions were-I assume in New York-before you went to the west coast.
Mr. WILLNER. Well, I had many jobs in New York. I sold au- tomobiles. I was superintendent of a furniture factory. I did clerical work for one or two insurance companies in the accounting department, among other jobs. I had many jobs.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the other jobs
Mr. WILLNER. I worked for the American Sugar Refining Co. Have you any specific jobs you are referring to, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, I have. Were you business manager of a pub- lication known as New Masses in New York from 1936 to 1939?
Mr. WILLNER. Mr. Tavenner, the magazine New Masses happens to be one of those-one of many magazines and publications and organizations which are listed as subversive in the guide which this committee has put out. Therefore, as an American citizen I claim my privilege under the fifth amendment and refuse to answer this question on the ground that an answer might tend to incriminate me. You are trying to link me with one of those organizations which you list as subversive.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, I object to the statement on the part of the witness and ask that it be stricken from the record. 
Mr. WooD. The statement that counsel for this committee is trying to link you with subversive organizations is not responsive to the question that was asked. (Representative Francis E. Walter entered hearing room.)
Mr. WooD. Please make your answers responsive to the question. I understood you to say that you declined to answer the question that was asked you whether or not you acted in the capacity of business manager for a publication known as the New Masses, and that your declination to answer that question is based upon your claim that such an answer might tend to incriminate you, and that you claim the privilege of the fifth amendment of the Constitution. Is that correct? (Representative Donald L. Jackson entered hearing room.)
Mr. WILLNaR. That is partly correct.
Mr. WooD. Will you finish it.
Mr. WILLNER. I think the answer is only partly correct, because I must give my reasons why I claim that privilege. 
Mr. WOOD. Because the New Masses, as you contend, has been cited- 
Mr. WILLNER. Not as I contend. As this committee contends. 
Mr. WOOD (continuing). Has been cited by the Attorney General of the United States as being a subversive organization, and that an answer to an inquiry as to whether you have been interested as busi- 378 INDUSTRY ness manager of it you contend would tend to incriminate you. Is that correct?
Mr. WILLNER. Mr. Wood, I was an agent in Hollywood for many years.
Mr. WooD. Please answer the questions that are asked you, Mr. Willner.
Mr. WILLNER. I believe I have answered the question.
Mr. WooD. You can understand the questions that are asked you.
Mr. WILLNER. I certainly can. 
Mr. WOOD. This committee is not endeavoring to link you anywhere. This committee is asking you what you have done in the past in linking yourself. You have the right to answer that question or not to answer it, as you determine, and you can offer whatever reasons you desire for your refusal to answer, if you do refuse.
Mr. WILLNER. I have given my reasons.
Mr. WooD. But bear in mind, sir, that this committee isn't endeavoring to link you anywhere.
Mr. WILLNER. I feel that they are. I have given my reasons, and I stand on them.
Mr. WOOD. I am trying to disabuse your mind as to that.
Mr. WILLNER. It would be very difficult, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WooD. A simple inquiry as to whether or not you have been identified as business manager of an organization is an effort to determine whether you have linked yourself with it or not. If you don't want to answer that question, then cloak yourself under the protection of the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the United States. That is your privilege.
Mr. WILLNER. I still stand on my answer, Mr. Wood.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you go to the west coast from New York?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe it was in 1938.
Mr. TAVENNER. What .work were you engaged in on the west coast when you first went there ?
Mr. WILLNER. I will decline to answer that for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there an office of the New Masses in California in 1939?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that question for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Charles Glenn, G-l-e-n-n, after your arrival in California ?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe that name is one of those that have been characterized by this committee, and an answer to that question might tend to link me with Charles Glenn. Therefore, I shall decline to answer it for the same reasons as previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a volume containing the April 18, 1940, issue of Peoples' World, which has an article on the right-hand side of page 5 by Charles Glenn, entitled "New Masses Makes Its Mark in Los Angeles," in connection with which there appears a photograph of a person by the name of George Willner. Will you examine that article and the photograph and state whether the photograph is a photograph of you [handing document to witness].  379 
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the course of this article by Charles Glenn there appears the following statement with reference to the magazine or publication New Masses: Does it click? Well, in less than a year since the arrival of George Willner, west coast representative of New Masses, subscriptions have increased five times. Do you have any comment you would like to make regarding that ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. Further on in the article this statement appears: We"are one of the leading magazines, and don't you forget it. When the Department of Justice went fishing, they called on us because of our position for peace, our position for the Soviet Union, and for democracy and security. The FBI didn't catch any fish, incidentally. Will you explain, if you know. what was meant by the statement that the publication stood for the Soviet Union ? 
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Further on in the article reference is made to cer- tain cultural accomplishments of the magazine, in which connection this language is used: And in all fairness let it be said that many of these now famous ventures have been managed by George Willner and Tiba Garland, now west coast representatives of the magazine. 
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is Tiba Garland the same person as your wife?
Mr. WILLNER. She is my wife.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of being in various executive positions in the city of New York prior to your going to Hollywood. Were you president of Central Distributing Agency of 52'West Fifteenth Street, New York City ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. The reason that you previously stated was that the publication inquired about has been cited by this committee or the Attorney General as a Communist-front organization. Are you taking that same position with regard to the Central Distributing Agency? I have no information that such an organization has been cited by this committee or any other.
Mr. WILLNER (after consulting counsel). I decline to answer that question for the same grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Which question is it you are declining to answer ? My last question to you was whether or not you are basing your refusal to answer upon the claim that the concern known as Central Distributing Agency had been cited by the Attorney General or this committee.
Mr. WILLNER. I am basing my refusal to reply on the grounds of the fifth amendment. 
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you make no further explanation of your refusal to answer? 
Mr. WILLNER. I stand on my answer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether the Central Distributing Agency has branches in Canada, the United States, Panama, and South America ? 81 5 95-51-pt. 2- 6 380 INDUSTRY 
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the Daily Worker, issued October 7, 1933, you were listed as a Communist Party candidate to the Board of Aldermen of the City of New York in the sixty-first district in Queens County. Is that correct?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the August 28 1934, issue of the Daily Worker, you were a Communist Party candidate for the assembly in the first district of Queens County. Is that correct?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. The Daily Worker issue of July 16, 1935, carries a letter to the editor from one George Willner, of New York City. This letter was addressed to, and I quote, "Comrade Editor," and said: There is no doubt in my mind, and this is the opinion of many Red builders with whom I have come in contact, that a sports section would aid the selling of the-Daily Worker. Did you write such a letter ?
Mr. WILNER. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you be willing to give some description of the "Red builders" referred to in that letter?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee, Mr. Willner, is in possession of information that you held a 1944 Communist Party book bearing No. 48508. Did you hold such book ?
Mr. WILLNR. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of Branch 1 of the Northwest Section of Los Angeles County Communist Party ?
Mr. WILLNER I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time used the name "Paul Wolf"?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Willner, Mrs. Meta Reis Rosenberg testified be- fore this committee on April 13, 1951. During her testimony she stated that she was at one time a member of the Communist Party and was assigned to a group or cell of which you were a member. Do you wish to affirm or deny Mrs. Rosenberg's testimony?
Mr. WLLNER. I decline to answer on the same grounds as previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that ground is that to answer might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. WILLNER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you consider it a crime to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that question, Mr. Kearney, on the sameL grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of being a writers' agent in Hollywood. When did you become a writers' agent?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe it was in the latter part of 1941 or early 1942. 
Mr. TAVENNER. By whom? 
Mr. WILLNER. I don't remember exactly.
Mr. TAVENNER. By whom were you employed?  INDUSTRY 381 
Mr. WILLNER. I was employed by Mr. Nat Goldstone. 
Mr. TAVENNER. That was known as the Nat Goldstone Agency?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Through the cooperation of the Nat Goldstone Agency the committee has procured certain information regarding a contract for the selling to Warner Bros. of the screen play entitled "These Many Years." I hand you a photostatic copy of booking information from the Nat Goldstone Agency, allegedly signed by you. I will ask you to examine it and identify the signature, if it is your signature [handing document to witness]. Is that your signature at the bottom?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. If I referred to the name "Goldstein," I meant "Goldstone." Does that change your answer? 
Mr. WLLNER. I understood you to say "Goldstone," and I answered .as if you had said "Goldstone." 
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer this photostatic copy of the page of the record into the record of this case and ask that it be marked -"Willner Exhibit No. 1." (The document referred to above was marked "Willner Exhibit No. 1.")1 
Mr. WOOD. After it is identified, would you hand it up here to the -ommittee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. This exhibit, Willner Exhibit No. 1, shows that These Many Years, by J. Redmond Prior, was sold to Warner Bros., for $20,000. The name of the artist, writer, and property is stated to be These Many Years, by J. Redmond Prior. Studio and individual who confirmed deal: Warner Bros., Budd Kay. It bears the date of March 1, 1948. Signature: George Willner.
Mr. WALTER. What was that name?
Mr. TAVENNER. Kay; K-a-y. With whom did you negotiate for the pfirchase and sale of this picture?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know J. Redmond Prior?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. I now hand you a paid check marked "Paid, March 4, 1948," bearing date of March 3, 1948, payable to J. Redmond Prior, on account of the Nat Goldstone Agency, in the amount of $17,900.52, which check is endorsed on the back "J. Redmond Prior, Jeanne Cole; for deposit only." Can you identify that check and state for what purpose it was given [handing document to witness] ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the check in evidence and ask that it be marked "Willner Exhibit No. 2." (The document referred to above was marked "Willner Exhibit No. 2.")2 1 See appendix to follow hearings printed under this title, for photographic reproduction of Willner Exhibit No. 1. 2 See appendix, to follow hearings printed under this title, for photographic reproduction -of Willner Exhibit No. 2. 382 INDUSTRY 
Mr. WOOD. It may be admitted. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Willner, is J. Redmond Prior the same person as Jeanne Cole?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Both of which names appear on the back of the check.
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that for the same reasons previ- ously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know who wrote the endorsement on the tack of the check?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that for the same reason. 
Mr. TAVENNER. IS it not a fact known to you, Mr. Willner, that Jeanne Cole, whose name appears on the back of that check, is the wife of Lester Cole?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. And do you not also know that the maiden name of Jeanne Cole was Prior-that the last name was Prior?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer for the same reason.
Mr. KEARNEY. Is Lester Cole now selling under the name of Jeanne Cole?
Mr. WILLNER. Mr. Kearney, I decline to answer that for the same reason previously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. You understand you are under oath here; don't you?
Mr. WInNER. I certainly understand that.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Cole was one of the 10 Hollywood convicted writers?
Mr. WILLNER (after consulting counsel). I understand that to be so from the newspapers. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Hyman Kraft, sometimes known as "Hy" Kraft?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe that name was mentioned in this committee, and again I say, Mr. Tavenner, I think you are trying to link me into an area, bring me into an -area, which might be dangerous for me. Therefore, I shall decline to answer -that on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to have the witness answer this question: Why would knowledge of this individual whom counsel just mentioned tend to incriminate you in any crime?
Mr. WILLNER. Well, if you allow me to answer in my own way, I would be glad to answer that.
Mr. KEARNEY. As long as you don't go into a long haranguing speech; yes.
Mr. WILLNER. Well, for one thing, an attempt on my part to try to explain why might involve me in an area that might become an area which would be dangerous and tend to incriminate me.
Mr. KEARNEY. The mere fact that you knew an individual would incriminate you in any crime-any of these names that have been mentioned here today?
Mr. WILLNER (after consulting counsel). Mr. Kearney, I feel that question is one by which you might be trying to entrap me.
Mr. KEARNEY. I am not trying to entrap you at all. I simply asked you a simple question.  INDUSTRY 383 
Mr. WILLNER. Mr. Kearney, people's names have been mentioned in this committee. I have noticed the following day they have lost their jobs. They have been guilty until proven innocent.
Mr. KEARNEY. Is that due to the fact that the names have been men- tioned here or the company they keep ?
Mr. WILLNER. I think it is probably due to the atmosphere in this hearing and the smell that comes from this hearing.
Mr. KEARNEY. I will say from the testimony of some of the wit- nesses, including yourself, that there is a terrific smell here. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Willner, you say you are a writers' agent. What sort of work does that entail? 
Mr. WILLNER. Well, it involves the sale of literary materials- novels, books, original stories-to studios. It involves the securing of employment for writers who are paid for writing for the motionpicture screen.
Mr. WALTER. For whom have you obtained employment?
Mr. WILLNER. Well, I have been employed as an agent for approximately 10 years, and I have secured employment for literally hundreds of people. To be more specificMr. WALTER. Whom did you obtain employment for since the 1st of January of this year ? 
Mr. WILLNER. I was unemployed as a writers' agent from the 1st of January of this year. 
Mr. WALTER. During the last year of your employment as a writers' agent, whom did you obtain employment for ? 
Mr. WILLNER. Oh, there were any number of people. I had a big list of people. The agency had a very big clientele. I can't remember specifically. I can't remember them all. There may have been as many as 50, 60, or 100.
Mr. WALTER. Give us the names of some ot the people that you ob- tained employment for. 
Mr. WILLNER. Oh, I believe I obtained employment for James Edward Grant. 
Mr. WALTER. James Edward Grant, did you say?
Mr. WILLNER. Yes; I did.
Mr. WALTER. Who else? 
Mr. WILLNER. I believe Lesser Samuels.
Mr. WAurER. Lester Samuels?
Mr. WILLNER. Lesser-L-e-s-s-e-r-Samuels. There were very many. I can't recall them all. M r. WALTER. In your position you were able to recommend to the various studios the works of various people who sought your service; is that correct ?
Mr. WILLNER. Well, not my services. The services of the particular writer involved. 
Mr. WALTER. So, as I understand it, a writer would come to you with a manuscript and you would find a place for him to sell it; is that correct?
Mr. WILLNER. Yes; I would try to do that.
Mr. WALTER. Isn't that your job ?
Mr. WILLNER. It was my job. It is not quite as simple as that, but I would say in its simplified form that is true. 384 
Mr. WALTER. Whose manuscripts did you sell? 
Mr. WILLNER. Well, besides the people who were under contract to us, we would receive manuscripts from various writers all over the country, people who lived in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago-various cities in the country.
Mr. WALTER. Did you obtain employment for Paul Jarrico?
Mr. WILLNER. I will refuse to answer that on the grounds pre- viously stated.
Mr. WALTER. Did you obtain employment for Hugo Butler ?
Mr. WILLNER. I will refuse to answer that for the same reason..
Mr. WALTER. Did you obtain employment for Robert Lees ?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe he is one of those who appeared before this committee. reason. Therefore, I will refuse to answer that for the same 
Mr. WALTER. The fact of the matter is, you obtained employment for the three individuals whose names I just mentioned; didn't you
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that for the same reason.
Mr. WALTER. A moment ago you were asked whether or not Jeanne Cole was the wife of Lester Cole, and you declined to answer the question on the ground that it might incriminate you. Why do you think that you would be incriminated if you knew that Jeanne and Lester Cole were husband and wife ?
Mr. WILLNER. I feel this question is.one-I don't know your nameCongressman Walter, in which you are trying to entrap me.
Mr. WALTER. There is no disposition or desire on the part of any- body to entrap you or any other witness.
Mr. WILLNER. That is a matter of opinion; isn't it?
Mr. WALTER. That is the accepted opinion of all but a few people who don't feel that they ought to assist us in our endeavors to expose the insidious machinations of certain groups. I want to know why you feel that you would be incriminated if you would answer the simple question as to whether or not Jeanne and Lester Cole were husband and wife.
Mr. WmLNER. I think you understand. The very intimation would tend to incriminate me, sir; and, therefore, I shall decline to answer that for the reasons previously stated. 
Mr. WALTER. Why do you think you would be incriminated? By the way, what do you think "incriminating" means ?
Mr. WILNER. Well, there was an article in the last issue of the New Yorker magazine, for instance, which explained the work of this committee. It stated that a man might go to see a baseball game in Brooklyn, go there to see the Dodgers play, and might go there every day that the Dodgers were playing there and not necessarily be a Dodger fan. I feel that because of the atmosphere created by this committee, because of the fact that there is such fear and terror in Hollywood today due to the actions of this committee and the cooperation it is getting from certain organizations, the Motion Picture Alliance in Hollywood, certain people who have lost their backbone, certain people who have suddenly become great singers.
Mr. WALTER. So that you refuse to answer because of an article that appeared in the New Yorker  INDUSTRY 385 
Mr. WILLNER. I refuse, sir, because it may tend to incriminate me.
Mr. WALTER. I have always wondered where some people got their legal opinions from, and I know now.
Mr. WILLNER. You are also aware there is a Constitution and fifth amendment.
Mr. WALTER. I know a great deal about it, and I have fought to defend it, sir, on several occasions. Now, how would you get into trouble if you would admit that you knew that a man and woman were husband and wife ?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe I have already answered that. I stand on my answer.
Mr. WALTER. You know, of course, that when a witness decides not to answer a perfectly innocent question he must assume the consequences, don't you.
Mr. WILLNER (after consulting counsel). I know, first of all, that a witness has a right to stand on his constitutional privileges.
Mr. WALTER. I think the circuit in which you reside has stated the law to be just exactly what I have stated. That is all, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Moulder.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Willner, the record would reveal that you have refused to answer probably 99 percent of the questions propounded to you, for the alleged reason that it would tend to incriminate you. My study of the long history of this committee reveals-I don't remember of any person who has ever been incriminated as a result of truthfully testifying before the committee. And under the Federal statutes any testimony you may give here could not be used against you. Therefore, your refusal to testify so consistently leaves a strong inference that you are still an ardent follower of the Communist Party and its purpose. That's all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions.
Mr. WILLNER. I'd like to answer the question. I am consulting with my counsel. I am not an attorney, Mr. Moulder. I don't know whether you quoted the law correctly or not. I am inclined to think that you did not. I would say that the fact that I did not answer the questions that were put to me for the reasons that I gave in no way whatsoever implies what you have suggested.
Mr. WALTER. Is that a legal opinion from the New Yorker?
Mr. WILLNER. I'd recommend you to read that article.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. Along the same line Mr. Moulder asked, I would like to ask you if you know of anyone who has been incriminated before this committee for answering questions truthfully.
Mr. WILLNER. I haven't followed the whole history of this committee, and I wouldn't know the answer to that, Mr. Velde.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Kearney. SMr. KEAREY. Mr. Willner, do you know today of any of the convicted 10 Hollywood writers who are now writing in Hollywood under assumed names
Mr. WLLN-ER. I decline to answer that on the grounds previously stated. 386 
Mr. IEARNEY. Going back to this check marked "Willner Exhibit No. 2," made payable to the order of J. Redmond Prior, and endorsed on the back thereof, "J. Redmond Prior, Jeanne Cole, for deposit only," do I understand you to refuse to testify that Jeanne Cole was the wife of Lester Cole?
Mr. WILLNER. I believe I answered that question. I stand on that answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Would you answer it again ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. You decline to answer as to what you did answer?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer the question you just asked me on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you know Mr. Cole?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you know Lester Cole was cited for contempt of Congress by the House of Representatives on November 24, 1947 ?
Mr. WILLNER. As I stated previously, I have read about that in the newspapers.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you know May 19, 1948, was the date set for his trial?
Mr. WILNER. I can't recall such a date.
Mr. KEARNEY. On this check you know it is dated March 3, 1948 ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. Two months before the date set for the trial of Mr. Cole, and the endorsement, as I said, on the back thereof is "J. Redmond Prior, Jeanne Cole, for deposit only." Is that correct?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that on the same grounds.
Mr. KEARNEY. Even though I show it to you ?
Mr. WILLNER. Even though you show it to me; yes, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. In other words, you wouldn't believe what you saw before your face ?
Mr. WILNER. I stand on my answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Now, you spoke something about fear and terror in Hollywood because of the actions of this committee. Isn't it true that the fear and terror in Hollywood today is the result of the individuals' actions rather than the actions of this committee?
Mr. WILLNER. My answer to that is that I would say it would have to be traced directly to the action of this committee. I have found no instance--Mr. KEARNEY. But you told us a minute ago in answer to one of
Mr. Velde's questions that you didn't know the history of this committee.
Mr. WILLNER. I didn't say that, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. What did you say?
Mr. WILLNER. I said I didn't know the entire history of this committee.
Mr. KEARNEY. All right, you didn't know the entire history of this committee then. Then that might go to the question that I just asked you, that the fear and terror in Hollywood today is the result of the machinations of certain individuals regarding their subversive activities against this country and not the actions of this committee. Isn't that so ?  INDUSTRY 387 I will have to state categorically that I think it is due directly to the actions of this committee.
Mr. WILLNER. No, sir. 
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you consider it a crime to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. If it wasn't a crime, would you answer it?
Mr. WILLNER. I stand on my previous answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. You'd still refuse to answer ?
Mr. WILLNER. For the grounds that I have previously stated I would refuse to answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I have only got one thing to say regarding the witness' testimony. I will say frankly that it is unworthy of belief, and I have only the utmost contempt for a witness who comes here and testifies in the manner this individual did this morning.
Mr. WILLNER. I would like to give my opinion of the committee since-Mr. KEARNEY. You can give it to me outside any time you want.
Mr. WILLNER. I'd like to give it right here in the hearing room.
Mr. WOOD. Let's stay on the subject of the investigation.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Willner, the studio negotiations for the picture These Many Years were conducted in the studio through Budd Kay. Is that my understanding?
Mr. WILLNER. I decline to answer that on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JACKSON. I believe-was that answer refused in your questioning?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; it was. 
Mr. JACKSON. It was refused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. I read from exhibit No. 1, which was the contract. The witness refused to answer any question relating to what that exhibit shows.
Mr. JACKSON. Reverting back for a moment, Mr. Willner, to your statement as to the fear and trembling and terror that is rampant in Hollywood today as an alleged result of the actions of this committee, would you think it would incriminate you to tell the names of some of these terrorized people to the committee? Who is in fear and trembling today in Hollywood? (Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing room.)
Mr. WILLNER. Well, obviously you don't understand Hollywood. I would say the whole community, no individualsMr. JACKSON. I have lived in and around Hollywood much longer than you have, Mr. Willner. That happens to be my home community, so I am thoroughly conversant with Hollywood. I am not thoroughly conversant with some of the thinking that goes on in some of the minds in Hollywood. Would you give us the name of one person who stands in fear and trembling today ?
Mr. WILLNER. Oh, there must be thousands of such people.
Mr. JACKSON. I am not asking for thousands. Give us one.
Mr. WILLNER. If you want one, I would say some of the witnesses that have appeared here have showed that fear. 388 
Mr. JACKSON. That hasn't been obvious. INDUSTRY Some have shown their arrogance. Many have shown their contempt. To the best of my knowledge, none of them has shown any fear and trembling since I have been a member of the committee.
Mr. WILLNER. Well, I was in the hearing room this morning. I heard one witness say that he was very fearful.
Mr. JACKSON. I don't recall the testimony. I saw a man who was ill and a man who had considerable courage. That's all, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Counsel, did you have any additional questions ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I understood you to say that your employment ceased with the Nat Goldstone Agency about the first of the year. 
Mr. WILNER. No; I didn't say that.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date that you mentioned ?
Mr. WILLNER. It was approximately-I didn't mention any, but I will mention it now. It was August 1950. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you become employed after that ?
Mr. WILLNER. I have not been employed after that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you go to any other agency ?
Mr. WmLNER. I did not.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated in the early part of your testimony that you were engaged as an agent in Florida, as I understood your testimony.
Mr. WILLNER. I don't recall stating that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what did you state in regard to your employ- ment in Florida ? 
Mr. WmLNER. I didn't state anything in regard to my employ- ment in Florida. The answer was to a question as to where I reside. I said I resided in Florida.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you employed in Florida?
Mr. WILnNER. I am not employed in Florida.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been in Florida ?
Mr. WILLNER. Oh, I'd say since approximately last October, October of 1950.
Mr. TAVENNER. Why did you leave jour employment with the Goldstone Agency ?
Mr. WILLNER. I left for personal reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it voluntary or involuntary?
Mr. WILLNER. I wasn't employed at the time, sir. I was half owner of the agency.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you interested as,an owner of the agency?
Mr. WmLNER. I would say for approximately 3 years. There were various stages. I believe in about 1945 I had a participating interest. That was increased as I went along, and I think it was 1947 that I became a full partner in the agency. 
Mr. TAVENNER. By that you mean you had half interest in the agency? 
Mr. WILLNER. I don't remember when I became a half owner. There was a time, I believe, when I was one-third, and then I became a full partner. That might have been in 1948 or thereabouts.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is all. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Moulder.  INDUSTRY 389 
Mr. MOULDER. A while ago, in response to the question I asked you or the statement which I made about your refusal to testify or answer questions leaving a strong inference, an impression that you were an ardent follower of the Communist Party and its objectives, in reply to that you said emphatically no, that it did not. Do you wish now to deny or affirm your belief in the Communist Party and its philosophies Do I understand your reply to that to be that you deny your belief in the Communist Party and its objectives or any philosophy of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WILLNER. It sounds altogether different as you now state it. What I was doing or what I was attempting to do was explain to you what the fifth amendment meant to me.
Mr. MOULDER. Would you answer the question: Do you believe in the Communist Party and its objectives?
Mr. WILLNER. You are just asking the question in a different way, sir, and I will stand on my previous answer and decline to answer. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Counselor, do you know of any reason why this witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance under this subpena
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir; not at the present time.
Mr. WOOD. Very well, you may be excused.
Mr. WILLNER. Mr. Wood, you have allowed other witnesses to read a statement. I have a short statement. May I read that ?
Mr. WOOD. I have seen the statement. It is quite lengthy. We will permit you to file it. (The statement referred to was filed with the committee.) (Witness excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Morris Carnovsky.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Carnovsky, you do solemnly swear the evidence you give before this committee shall be the truth, the whole. truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I do. TESTIMONY OF MORRIS CARNOVSKY, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, MARTIN POPPER
