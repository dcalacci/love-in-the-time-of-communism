Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir, I am Marc Lawrence, and I am a motion picture actor. I have been an actor for 19 years in the motion picture business. I came to California in 1932, and in 1932 I worked around Hollywood.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I interrupt you for a moment there. I want the record to show whether or not you are represented here by counsel. I assume you are. 365 366 INDUSTRY 
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir, I am. This is Mr. Madden, my attorney.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you identify yourself for the record, giving your name and the location of your office?
Mr. MADDEN. Murdaugh S. Madden, 1830 Jefferson Place NW., Washington, D. C.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me ask you a few preliminary questions first.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I was born in New York City in 1910. I attended public school. I went to high school, went to college. after a year and a half. I then did a number of plays I came to California. In California I did a number and then following that I did motion-picture work. I left college in New York. of plays, too, Now, around 1938, I believe it was, there were a number ofMr. TAVENNER. Let me interrupt you again for a moment. How do you spell your first name. I want to get you properly identified.
Mr. LAWRENCE. M-a-r-c.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that your name or is it a professional name?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That is my professional and legal name, sir. Pro- fessional and legal name.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your father's name?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Goldsmith.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name was legally changed ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That's correct, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO Marc Lawrence?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That's right. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When was it legally changed?
Mr. LAWRENCE. About 1940.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is sufficient. Now if you will proceed.
Mr. LAWRENCE. About 1938 I attended a number of "cause parties." This was not because I was interested at the -time, but that is what happened: There was a girl who played the piano very well, and she introduced me to these parties. I went to these parties with her, and then I met an actor named Lionel Stander, who said to me, "You want to get to know how to talk to these people. The thing for you to do is to go to classes."
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, that was Lionel Stander?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Lionel Stander.
Mr. TAVENNER. S-t-a-n-d-e-r? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. S-t-a-n-d-e-r, that is correct, sir. So I went to a number of classes with these guys.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was this? Did you state the date?
Mr. LAWRENCE. About 1938, sir. I went to a number of these parties where they used to read from the books and read the lectures, and intellectuals would tell stories, and it was very confusing.
Mr. TAVENNER. The stories of what ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. They would read. Guys come in and they would read books. They would tell us, "This is what happened, and this is the reason for the war in Spain. This is what happened here, and that is what happened there." I got a lot of headaches listening to these guys. I want to say this: That after I attended about 12 of these meetings, what happened was this. They came to me with a card and they said, "Sign this card, because you are a member of the party, but don't  INDUSTRY ' 367 sign your own name for security reasons." I didn't know what this meant. I was at the time interested in paying, you know, for the expenses of this thing, so I signed a name. Not my name. I picked it out of a newspaper, and that is what I signed. I don't know what name I signed.
Mr. TAVENNER. You don't remember now the name that you used?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No, I don't sir. I never saw the card after that. Now, I want to tell that my appearance in motion pictures has been over a period of 19 years. I have never considered myself a Communist, but this is the story of how it happened: After I attended a number of these meetings where they spoke to me-intellectuals spoke to me-I then went to cell meetings where the common chairmen, guys, would make speeches. These guys confused me. They gave me headaches. And they talked, and they kept telling me a lot of things like that. I didn't like speeches, because these things disturbed me. So I left after about 12 of these meetings. (Representative Morgan M. Moulder entered hearing room.)
Mr. LAWRENCE. Following that-this must have been in about 1939-I left and had no connection at all with the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, before you go any further, let's talk a little more about what occurred in 1938. You say you attended about 12 cell meetings?
Mr. LAWRENCE. About 12; yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were these meetings held?
Mr. LAWRENCE. They were held in different homes in Hollywood. Some I remember; some of them I don't. I remember a guy named Lester Cole. Lester Cole was there, and the guy who introduced me to the party, Lionel Stander, he was there. There was Bob Rossen. I believe I attended some of his meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that Robert Rossen?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Robert Rossen, R-o-s-s-o-n or e-n. I believe that is the way you spell his name. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Madelaine Ruthven a member of that cell with you? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. I don't remember the name, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Waldo Salt a member?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I don't remember the name. I do remember that the classes we attended there was Dick Collins in the class.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is Richard Collins?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Richard Collins, that's right. 
Mr. WOOD. Let the record show that Mr. Moulder of the committee is present now.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated that Richard Collins was a member?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That's correct, as far as I knew. I didn't sign any card in his presence and he didn't sign any in my presence.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say he attended the cell meetings?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No, he attended the class meetings, where I first heard the ideas, where the ideas were first spoken. This is what I remember. Following that I think Richard and I were together in a class in the cell.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the cell ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes. 36S COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. Now I want to get the names of those who were together with you in the Communist Party cell.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, let's see if I remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. You named a few moments ago Lester Cole.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he one of those in the cell with you?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, he was at the time, that's correct; and there was Gordon Kahn.
Mr. TAVENNER. Gordon Kahn?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. K-a-h-n?
Mr. LAWRENCE. K-a-h-n.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated that Lionel Stander was the one who introduced you into the Communist Party ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. He was the guy that said to me, "Get to know this stuff and you will make out more with the dames." This is the introduction. This is the guy. 
Mr. VELDE. What was that he said to you
Mr. LAWRENCE. You get to know the dames more, with the line. I got confused a great deal. Now, this stuff really confused me. I thought at first it was a good idea. I went to the thing because I thought that you could learn something. I never learned anything.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was he one of the persons who was in this cell with you, Lionel Stander ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. He was; yes. Yes, of course he was.
Mr. TAVENNER. NOW let us see if we can recall the names of any others.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes. There was Mr. Bromberg. I believe he was there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know what Mr. Bromberg's first name and middle initials are ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. J. Edward Bromberg. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there any others in that particular group whose names you can recall?
Mr. LAWRENCE. It is very--I can't. If you mention the name, maybe I can remember the name. I maybe can remember the way he looked. But this is hard for me to identify. I want to say-Mr. TAVENNER. You mentioned the name of Robert Rossen?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Rossen; yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't know whether you identified him as being in this particular group or not. I would like to know whether he was.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Whether I met him at "cause parties" or not I don't remember, but I do recall at the time he was interested in the idea. Whether I saw him at one of the cell meetings, this is hard for me to identify because there were a lot of parties at the time. I would like to say following this particular period, 1938-following this particular period I had nothing at all to do with the Communist Party. In 1944, I believe it was--No. The Actors' Lab were doing-the Actor's Lab is an acting organization in Hollywood. They were doing a lot of plays for the war effort, and about 1944 I contributed by doing a play for the war effort, and I toured up and down the coast, went to Army camps, went to hospitals, went to other places, and I did these plays for the USO. About this time-around this time, I think it was-there was a sort of a general cocktail party at which John COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 369 Howard Lawson made a speech about Russia and America, that Russia and America were Allies capital and labor don't have to fight any more, and the thing to do is to believe this idea. Now, whether I signed or not at that time, I don't remember; but I do know a lot of guys of the lab said, "Come together and be in this thing, and it sounds great." So I,followed a couple of the guys, and we signed up, I believe. I believe-I don't remember exactly-following that attended about 12 cell meetings at the lab, where I saw Joe Bromberg and Morris Carnovsky. Oh, yes, whether at that time I signed a petition or not, I don't remember, but at that party, as I understand it, other guys did. I followed that. Now, thenMr. TAVENNER. This, you say, was in 1944 that you went back into the Communist Party
Mr. LAWRENCE. I don't think I went back in. It was an idea. He said, "The Communist Party doesn't have to exist any more as a party." This was the idea-that we guys can say that there doesn't have to be a Communist Party, because Russia and America are friends.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did they call it the Communist Political Association ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That's it, they did. They did call it the Communist Political Association.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then this was the period when the Communist Po- litical Association was acting in the place of the Communist Party ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That's correct. That's correct, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. And that is when you again affiliated with the group? I affiliated with the group only because I was 
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes. working in the Actors' Lab.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was this a group of persons within the Actors' Lab with which you affiliated?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, there were a group of people. This was the time. Now, what they did at the Actors' Lab interested me more, because they were talking about actors' problems. That's why I became interested in it. They discussed plays that they were going to do at the lab. They discussed ideas for new plays, and so on and so forth, and I found it was interesting for me. So I went there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us the names of those who were mem- bers with you in this cell within the Actors' Lab ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, there was J. Bromberg, J. Edward Bomberg, the man I mentioned know whether she was meeting at her house.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell you spell that? before. There was Karen Morley. I don't connected directly with the lab. I went to a There was Morris Carnovsky. us a little about Morris Carnovsky. How do 
Mr. LAWRENCE. C-a-r-n-o-v-s-k-y.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how he was employed at that time?
Mr. LAWRENCE. He was working in the industry. He was a motion- picture actor. 
Mr. TAVENNER. A motion-picture actor?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did the Communist Party cell ever meet in his home to your knowledge? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, I did meet in.his home. 
Mr. TAVENNER. DO you recall how often you met in his home? 370 INDUSTRY 
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, maybe once every 2 weeks. There were meetings actually at the lab, too-the Actors' Lab. I attended many meetings at the lab. Since I was a member of the staff, I also taught motion-picture acting at the lab. I don't know how many meetings I attended at the lab or how many meetings I attended at Morris Carnovsky's house, but I do feel that I didn't attend too many party meetings, because this didn't interest me particularly. What interested me particularly were the problems of the actor. This was my main concern.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. Now, you have named three.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. J. Edward Bromberg, Karen Morley, and Morris Were there others whose names you can now recall?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, there were kids at the lab that I don't recall, whose names I don't remember. They were also at the cell meetings. 1 don't remember them. This is what I do remember. This is actual. There was a meeting held at Karen Morley's house one night in which there was a kind of bunch of actors. Sterling Hayden was there. Larry Parks was there. They were discussing some big thing about what to do with the actors. There was a lot of fuss made at the time. And I remember Sterling and I remember Larry. I remember Anne Revere, Howard Da Silva, Lloyd Gough, and these people. That is what I do remember. Now, I don't know if these people were members of the Communist Party, but it was supposed to have been a closed cell. I couldn't identify these people. Carnovsky. 
Mr. KEARNEY. Was Gale Sondergaard there?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I don't remember her, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you attend any Communist meetings with her, sir?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I don't remember, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Will Geer?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I have never seen Will Geer at a Communist meet- ing, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, before we discuss the meeting at Karen Mor- ley's, let us see if we can identify more persons who were members of this cell within Actors' Lab. You have named three. Can you recall any others?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, there was an actor called Jeff Corey who at- tended these meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. C-o-r-e-y?
Mr. LAWRENCE. C-o-r-e-y. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Larry Parks attend these meetings ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I saw Larry Parks at this big meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the big meeting?
Mr. LAWRENCE. At Karen Morley's house. That is where I saw Larry Parks.
Mr. WooD. I wonder if you could speak a little bit louder. We can hardly hear you up here.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I am sorry. I am awfully sorry.
Mr. WOOD. A little more distinctly if you can.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was John Howard Lawson connected in any way with this particular cell ? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. I don't think he was, sir. The only meeting I remember with John Howard Lawson is when he spoke at this big  INDUSTRY meeting for the preservation of America and Russia's alliance. is what I do remember about John Howard Lawson. 371 This 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who usually acted as chairman of this group or cell? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. The comrade chairmen. There were rotating chair- men. There were different chairmen every week. They were chosen by the people there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall any of those who acted as chairmen while you were present?
Mr. LAWRENcE. I was chairman once. 
Mr. TAVENNER. On one occasion you were a chairman ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes; I was. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall others who served as chairmen?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Most Of the people served as chairmen. Most of the people there. This wasn't assigned to any one person. 
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of this group having met at the home of Morris Carnovsky and that it also met at the Actor's Lab. Did it meet at the home of any of the other members ? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. At Joe Bromberg's house.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently did it meet there?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I wouldn't recall. I attended maybe one or two..
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there a secretary of this group, a person who served as secretary? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. There must have been a secretary, because that was financial business. They came in and they asked you to contribute money. So there must have been a secretary there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you pay dues? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. I paid a very small amount, sir. them a penny. I am sorry I paid 
Mr. WOOD. I didn't get that.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I am sorry I ever paid them a penny.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the amounts of dues that you paid?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I paid a very nominal amount, maybe $1 or $2 a month. Something like that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall to whom you paid the money ? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. It was a girl who came up and called you into private session, and she said, "How much money do you want to give. How much money can you give?" And I didn't like to give any. I didn't give too much.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall her name?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she a member of this particular cell?
Mr. LAWRENCE. She must have been, or an outsider that came in. She must have been. 
Mr. TAVENNER. But you do not recall her name ? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us go back for a moment to this first group in 1938. 
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who acted as chairman of that particular group ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, there were different people, like Lester Cole and Gordon Kahn, and the other guys that gave the speeches.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you pay dues at that time ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes; I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall to whom you paid them 372 
Mr. LAWRENCE. It was the same arrangement then. -They called you in and they asked you to pay money. And I didn't earn too much money at the time. I said, "I can't give too much money."
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall to whom you paid the money ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No, sir; I do not.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of a large meeting held at the home of Karen Morley.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. How did it happen that you attended that meeting!
Mr. LAWRENCE. They called me. Somebody called me up and said, "Come to this meeting there and participate."
Mr. TAVENNER. This was a large group ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. This was not the cell that you had been a member of?
Mr. LAWRENCE.
Mr. TAVENNER.
Mr. LAWRENCE.
Mr. TAVENNER.
Mr. LAWRENCE. That is correct. A different group? That is correct. Do you know what kind of a meeting it was ? I know there was a lot of noise about what the actors should do in the Screen Actors' Guild. This was the tenor of the meeting. Sterling Hayden gave a big speech, and the other guys gave big speeches, and it was very exciting at the time. This I remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Sterling Hayden has testified before this com- mittee that he was a member of the Communist Party cell and that he was directed to-associate with a group working within the Screen Actors' Guild for the purpose of swinging the Screen Actors' Guild into support of the Conference of Studio Unions, which was out on a strike at that time. Do you recall whether the meeting which you attended had to deal with that subject?
Mr. LAWRENCE. It might have, sir. It might have. Actually, I don't remember the details of it; but I know there was a lot of excitement at the time, tremendous amount of excitement, because following that there was a meeting at the Screen Actors' Guild in which the opposition, so-called, Communists defended their position against what the Screen Actors' Guild wanted to do at the time, and they were given the opportunity to do that. I didn't make any speeches.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you become a member of any organizations that were known as Communist-front organizations which were later cited as Communist-front organizations?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I never identified my name with any such organization outside of this particular mistake that I made.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say you never identified yourself with any groups of that kind other than the Communist Party ?
Mr. LAWRENCE.
Mr. TAVENNER.
Mr. LAWRENCE.
Mr. TAVENNER. That's correct. Which you now consider to have been a mistake A great mistake. A great and unholy mistake. How long did you remain a member of the Com- munist Party ? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, I didn't believe myself to be a member of the Communist Party. I didn't believe myself to be a member of the Communist Party actually in terms of participation. I merely investi-  373 gated and wanted to hear. I wanted to see what these people had to say, and about 1946 I did one play for the Actors' Lab, and after that particular play I left the Actors' Lab and had nothing to do with any activity of the lab or any activity in the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the title of the play? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. The title of the play was "Volpone." Following that I never came near the Actors' Lab or the organization of the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say that was in 1946 ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. About 1946, I believe.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you had any affiliation or connection of any kind with the Communist Party since that time ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No, sir; I never have. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Lawrence, it is rather unusual to find a person who was connected with the Communist Party and who at the same time was not affiliated with what is known as the Communist-front organization. Were you ever requested to unite with a Communist-front organization ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes; I was, but I refused to cooperate in this way. I felt that what I was interested in was in seeking and trying to find out, but I never tried to participate as a man who had to lend his name. I always refused to lend my name to such organizations.
Mr. TAVENNER. You indicate that your primary interest in. uniting with the Communist Party was to investigate and find out what it was doing. What do you mean by that ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, I am a curious kind of "schmoe". I am the kind of a guy that listens to speeches. The guy comes over to me and says, "Listen. That sounds pretty good. Why don't you defend this idea?" And I got involved that way. I didn't defend the idea. I listened to the idea. I investigated the idea. I am not interested in the idea. I found that this is a very destructive thing. It has been to me. And I refused to participate in any way to destroy any of my present feelings about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Moulder?
Mr. MOULDER. No questions.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I would like to make a contribution here. I feel that having been a member of the Communist Party has been a great error in my life, a hideous error. I have never in my life voted the Communist ticket. I have been a registered Democrat, and I have always voted Democratic Party. My feeling about the Communist Party is that it is a vety destructive one. I will not in any way as a patriot defend any of its interests. I feel that strongly about it. I do wish. further to say that I will defend this country in case of war with Russia. I will defend it with my life.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Moulder?
Mr. MOULDER. No questions. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Frazier? 
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde? 374 INDUSTRY 
Mr. YELDE. Mr. Lawrence, we appreciate the testimony that you have given us here in connection with some of the names of the people you met and that you were a member of the Communist Party. You have referred to Robert Rossen. Will you describe your meeting with him ? I think you said you met at his home. MIr. LAWRENCE. It might have been parties at his home or cause parties at his home. I have never been in any cell meetings with
Mr. Robert Rossen.
Mr. VELDE. Do you know where Mr. Rossen is at the present time?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No; I do not, sir. 
Mr. VELDE. How long has it been since you have seen him? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. I haven't seen Mr. Rossen in 7 years, maybe.
Mr. VELDE. Can you give any further details of your meetings with
Mr.Rossen when he was present in the Communist Party meetings?
Mr. LAWRENCE. I wouldn't recall any, sir. I recall his face. I recall him as a man. That is all I recall, sir.
Mr. VELDE. Were you acquainted with Sylvia Morrow ? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. No.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Kearney ? 
Mr. KEARNEY. I also appreciate your testimony, Mr. Lawrence. There is only one question I have to ask you after your testimony. Are you now fully convinced that the Communist Party has for its aims and objectives the overthrow of our representative form of government?
Mr. LAWRENCE. If I am not convinced, I would not come here to make the statement that I make.
Mr. KARNEY. Thank you.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. Who called you for the Karen Morley meeting? Do you recall?
Mr. LAWRENCE. This I don't recall, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. You don't recall? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. I just got a phone call.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know V. J. Jerome ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. No.
Mr. JACKSON. You never met him? 
Mr. LAWRENCE. I never met him.
Mr. JACKSON. I congratulate you upon your spendid memory. You should have less difficulty in learning scripts than some of the people who have appeared here.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I was a very nervous man today. 
Mr. JACKSON. I congratulate you upon such straightforward testimony. I am much more impressed with it than I am with some that has been heard here the last few days. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Just one question. Have you identified all of the persons that you can now recallMr. LAWRENCE. To the best of my knowledge, sir.
Mr. WooD (continuing). Who attended any of these meetings while you were affiliated with the party ?
Mr. LAWRENCE. To the best of my knowledge, I have identified those that I think I met and those I have seen.
Mr. WOOD. You have no further recollection of any ? COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 375 
Mr. LAWRENCE. If I have sir, I will communicate this information to you, if I recall any.
Mr. WOOD. Thank you very much, sir. .Mr. VELDE. I have just one more question, Mr. Chairman. When did you first become aware of the fact that there was a Communist movement in Hollywood?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Around 1938. This was when I went to these "cause parties," when there was a great deal of talk about Spain. And this piano-player girl who brought me to the place, she was interested at the time, so I went with her.
Mr. VELDE. Who was that piano player ?
Mr. LAWRENCe. A piano player. A brunette who played the piano,
Mr. VELDE. I didn't get that.
Mr. LAWRENCE. A brunette who played the piano.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson, do you have a further question?
Mr. JACKSON. One. Mr. Lawrence, do you believe, out of your experience in Hollywood, that it would be possible to be around that community for a period of 8 or 10 years, before, during, and after the war, and not know that there was a Communist organization going on or a Communist organization within the industry at that time?
Mr. LAWRENCE.. No; I am very apolitical.
Mr.' JACKSON. You could be apolitical and still could know about this cell organization. Is it likely that the average person would know about such organization?
Mr. LAWRENCE. It is very likely they would, sir. It is very likely they would, but at the time I wasn't particularly interested.
Mr. JACKSON. Just in a general way, it would be extremely difficult not to know that there was a Communist-cell organization?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That is absolutely correct.
Mr. JACKSON. By the same token, it would be extremely farfetched to be around Hollywood for 10 years and not know a Communist, wouldn't it?
Mr. LAWRENCE. It might be possible.
Mr. JACKSON. It might be possible to be around Hollywood for 10 yearsMr. LAWRENCE. I have never considered myself a Communist.
Mr. JACKSON. This is general. I am not trying to make any points so far as you are concerned. I am merely asking whether or not it would be extremely difficult to be in Hollywood during that period for 10 years and not know a Communist, wouldn't it?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That might be so. That's correct, sir. That's absolutely correct.
Mr. JACKSON. It might be so? You would not know?
Mr. LAWRENCE. That's correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Or it might be so, you would know? Perhaps if you consult with your counsel.
Mr. LAWRENCE (after consulting counsel). I still don't understand the question.
Mr. JACKSON. We have had some witnesses who have been wideeyed with astonishment after 10 or 12 years in Hollywood, at the disclosure that there were Communists in Hollywood.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, that's silly. Of coursethat's silly.
Mr. WooD. Is there any reason, Mr. Counsel, why this witness should not be excused from further attendance on this subpena ? 376 
Mr. TAVENNER. NO, sir. 
Mr. WOOD. I believe you are here in obedience to a subpena
Mr. LAWRENCE. Oh, yes, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Very well. You may be excused from further attendance.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Thank you, gentlemen. (Witness excused.)
