Miss WINTERS. I was secretary there also.
Mr. TAVENNER. To whom were you secretary?
Miss WINTERS. Meta Reis Rosenberg.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the circumstances under which you be- came employed at Berg-Allen Berg?
Miss WINTERS. I had formerly worked for Mrs. Rosenberg for a period at Paramount, and when she left Paramount and went to Berg-Allen Berg she asked me to come and work for her there. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your duties as secretary to Mrs. Rosenberg?
Miss WINTERS. Well, general secretarial work, taking dictation, answering telephones, and taking care of the office when she was out at the studios.
Mr. TAVENNER. While you were employed there, did you become acquainted with a sea captain by the name of Warwick Tompkins?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state your reason again?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by "in violation of the fifth amendment"?
Miss WINTERS. I understand the fifth amendment to protect a per- son from testifying against himself. 
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you feel that a truthful answer to that question might subject you to criminal prosecution? That is the ground upon which I understand that you refuse to answer the question; is that correct?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Sterling Hayden testified before the committee that he met you through Warwick Tompkins and, quoting his testimony, "One day she said to me, 'Why don't you stop talking and join the Communist Party ?'" and as a result, Sterling Hayden testified that he did join the Communist Party. Did you have anything to do with recruiting Sterling Hayden into the Communist Party?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Miss WrNTER. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been a member of the Communist Party?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you affiliated in any way with the Hollywood Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer that question on the ground that it may tend to incriminate me. 81595-51-pt. 2-11 460

Mr. MOULDER. That is all.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde.

Mr. VELDE. Up to the present time?
Miss WINTERS. Yes.
Mr. VELDE. During that time, were you aware that there was a Com- munist movement on in Hollywood ?
Miss WINTERS. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me. SMr. VELDE. How would it tend to incriminate you to know that there was a Communist movement in Hollywood ?

Mr. WooD. Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. No questions. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Miss Winters, during the period of time you were employed in the several studios as a secretary, how was the decision made as to whom you were going to work for? Was it a secretarial pool, or did you go to a studio with the understanding you would work for a particular person?
Miss WINTERS. Usually a secretarial pool.
Mr. JACKSON. For whom did you work during the time you were at Universal Studios?
Miss WINTERS. That would take quite a while. I started out work- ing in the stenographic department, in the pool. During my period of employment there I worked for Mr. Cochran, who was president of the company, when he was on. the coast. I worked for a casting director.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the casting director?
Miss WINTERS. Dan Kelly. And I worked for the head of the studio and his assistant.  461 
Mr. JACKSON. Who was that at that time ?
Miss WINTERs. The head of the studio at that time was Charles Rogers. And I worked for a few writers and directors; I don't quite remember how many.
Mr. JACKSON. And to whom were you secretary at RKO?
Miss WINTERS. I was not a secretary. I was not assigned to anybody in particular at RKO. My employment there was very short. I was in the stenographic department.
Mr. JACKSON. And at Paramount? 
Miss WINTERS. I worked in the story department.
Mr. JACKSON. Under whose direction?
Miss WINTERS. William Dozier was then head of the story department, and I would say I presume it was for him that I worked, actually.
Mr. JACKSON. He was your immediate superior?
Miss WINTERS. No. Several people worked under him. A man named John Hanighan had direct charge of the story-files department, and for a time Meta Reis Rosenberg had that position and I worked for her.
Mr. JACKSON. Is that where you made the contact that later led to your employment at Berg-Allen Berg?
Miss WINTERS. That is correct.
Mr. JACKSON. I will say that the mention of these names should in no way be construed as a connotation of Communist affiliation. No further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. PorrER. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you work for Berg-Allen Berg?
Miss WINTERS. As far as I remember, from 1945 to 1948 or 1949; I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Do you desire to retain this witness?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. GORENFELD. DO I understand the witness is excused?
Mr. WOOD. Yes.
