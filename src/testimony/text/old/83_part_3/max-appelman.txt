Mr. APPELMAN. Max Appelman.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is noted you are accompanied by counsel. Will counsel please identify himself for the record ?
Mr. WnmN. I am identified by the name A. L. Wirin, attorney, Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Appelman
Mr. APPELMAN. I was born on January 1, 1910, in White Russia. I was brought here when I was a year old.
Mr. TAVENNER. You now reside in Los Angeles ?
Mr. APPELMAN. I do.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in Los Angeles?
Mr. APPELMAN. I don't remember whether it was 1934 or 1935.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you lived here continuously since that time ?
Mr. APPELMAN. To the best of my recollection except for the time I was in the armed services I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. What period of time were you in the armed services!
Mr. APPELMAN. I was taken into the Army in February 1942 and was discharged from the Army, I think it was 1945. If you want the exact date, I have it.
Mr. TAVENNER. The exact date is unimportant.
Mr. APPELMAN. It was between 1942, the early part of 1942 and prob- ably the early part of 1945.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been
Mr. APPELMAN. I have a high-school education.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation ?
Mr. APPELMAN. I don't believe I can answer that question about occupation, I don't think that it is the concern of this committee what I do for a living.
Mr. DOYLE. We cannot accept the answer. We believe the question is pertinent and I direct you to answer.
Mr. APPELMAN. I say again I don't intend to discuss how I earn a living for myself and my family with the committee. I have here in my possession a newspaper clipping, Los Angeles Times, with direct quotation from Mr. Doyle. I am telling you why I can't answer that question and I quote: There is no doubt that these peopleparagraph above refers to Communistsare now trying to infiltrate political parties, both Republican and Democratic, churches, schools, labor unions, and business firms. It is obvious from thisMr. DOYLE. I stand by that statement. There is ample evidence to the fact. That is a true statement.
Mr. WinN. He is stating his reasons.
Mr. DOYLE. I just want to state I stand onMr. APPLEMAN. I am not contradicting you. I am quoting you. The scope of this illegal inquiry is so broad that Mr. Doyle has made it very clear to me that I cannot even answer a question regarding my COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1769 occupation without fear of possible incrimination. I want to say that I am suspicious of this committee. I think that this committee is out to trap me with some incriminatingMr. DOYLE. WitnessMr. APPELMAN. My last sentence is my constitutional claim. All right. So it is on this basis that I am compelled to claim the rights guaranteed me in the Constitution and particularly those of the first and the fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Has your occupation in part included employment by the Communist Party?
Mr. APPELMAN. I have already said that I am not going to discuss this matter with this committee for the grounds I have already stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a document entitled "Two Decades of Progress," and ask you to examine it, particularly the first page. Will you state the caption at the top of the page ?
Mr. APPLEMAN. I don't think I am required to read any of this document. I decline to do so on the grounds already stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Doesn't it state "Twenty Years of Progress of the Communist Party" ?
Mr. APPLEMAN. You can read as well as I can, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine the fourth or fifth line from the caption and state whether or not there appears there the name of the secretary of the Communist Party ?
Mr. APPELMAN. I say again you can read just as well as I can. I am not going to read any document which may possibly incriminate me or possibly subject me to unwarranted prosecution. I want to make that very clear.
Mr. SCHERER. Or warranted prosecution?
Mr. APPELMAN. That is what you say, Mr. Scherer. 
Mr. DOYLE. On what grounds, Witness? 
Mr. APPELMAN. On the ground previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I desire to offer the frontispiece and page 1 of the document in evidence and ask that it be marked "Appelman Exhibit No. 1" for identification only.
Mr. MOULDER. Is this witness named as the secretary in the document?
Mr. SCHERER. That is what I wanted to know.
Mr. DOYLE. The document will be so received and so marked.
Mr. WIRIN. I don't find the word "secretary" on that sheet.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am afraid I am wrong. That is why I want to read it. 
Mr. SCHERER (reading) : Party, USA, ComTwenty Years of Growth and Progress of the Communist munist Party, Los Angeles County. It has the hammer and sickle on it.

He is educational director. of the ComMr. TAVENNER. Were you the educational director munist Party of Los Angeles County in September 1939? that
Mr. APPE.MAN. I wonder if we can't have an understanding for this committee I cannot in good conscience become an informer 1770 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA and will not in my own self-interest against possible incrimination and unwarranted prosecution, answer questions concerning the Communist Party or anything even remotely related to it on the grounds previously stated, if that is what you want.
Mr. DOYLE. May this be understood to save your time: Instead of reading a prepared statement, each time, even though it is a brief oneMr. WIRIN. He isn't reading a prepared statement each time.
Mr. DoLE. I saw him. It is in front of him.
Mr. APPELMAN. In order to be sure to give the committee the right answer.
Mr. DOYLE. A constitutional claim honestly made is always the right answer. That is all you need make. It will save your time in reading those statements. Proceed.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you Kimple Exhibits Nos. 7 and 8 and I will ask you whether or not they were your Communist Party books issued to you on the dates indicated on each. (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. APPELMAN. Did you ask me a question, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. APPELMAN. Would you repeat the question
Mr. TAVENNER. Read him the question. (The reporter read from his notes as requested.)
Mr. APPELMAN. This question falls in the same province and so I must give the same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time known by the name of Mat Pelman?
Mr. APPELMAN. I give you the same answer, sir.
Mr. MOULDER. You decline to answer for the same reasons?
Mr. APPELMAN. I decline to answer for the reasons I have previously given.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you labor director of the Communist Party in Los Angeles County ?
Mr. APPELMAN. I decline to answer for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. APPELMAN. I again decline to answer for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DOYLE. Any questions, Mr. Moulder
Mr. MOULDER. No.
Mr. DOYLE. Any questions, Mr. Scherer ? O.
Mr. SCHERER.
Mr. DOYLE. May I make this one observation: If you were active in the Communist Party at any time and you are out of it, why don't you help your Government by helping us to understand how best to meet the problem of the subversive activities, whether it is in the Communist Party or in other elements of our society? I make that suggestion to you. If you are out of the party, no matter if you were in in 1939 when this book was published, if you are out of it and learned things of value to your country, about subversive activities or how the Communist Party here and there, if it did when you were in it, and you are out of it, engages in any way in subversive activities, why don't you give that benefit to your Congress ? Didn't suggest that to get into an argument with you. You are a young man, evidently an important young man, with fine training. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1771 I don't mean to impose on you or put you on the spot, sir. I just want to leave that thought with you. Thank you, Mr. Wirin and the witness.
Mr. WInw. May the record show my good behavior ?
Mr. DOLE. Very good. (Whereupon, the witness was excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Joseph Aidlin. May this last contribution go to the Red Cross?
Mr. WIRIt.
Mr. SCHERER. No.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. AIDLIN. I do. TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH W. AIDLIN
