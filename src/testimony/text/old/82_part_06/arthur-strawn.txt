Mr. STR \n x. I xxas born in Ness York City, September 29, 1900. Mi. Will ELER. Will yot give ui, a brief r16sumn of your educational background.
Mr. STRAWN. You don't nind if I refer to a couple of notes that I have brought, do you ? 2)53 2054 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. WHEELER. That will be perfectly all right.
Mr. STRAWN. I have brought this with me in the interest of accuracy. I was graduated from high school in St. Louis in 1918. After volunteering for service in the First World War, and the war ending before I could serve, although I had been accepted, I then went on and attended Washington University of St. Louis, from which I was graduated. First, I should say, I did a year at Stanford and then I got my bachelor of arts degree from Washington University in 1925 or 1926.
Mr. WHEELER. Does that conclude your formal education?
Mr. STRAIN. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your occupational background after leaving school?
Mr. STRAWN. I began writing while I was still going to college. I did newspaper work and then when I left the university I continued on with that. I worked on the St Louis Post-Dispatch, and from there I went to New York and became, for a number of years, their New York correspondent and began to write for magazines and had books published and so on.
Mr. WHEELER. How long have you been associated with the motionpicture industry?
Mr. STRAWN. Well, while I was in New York, and still while I was doing newspaper work and contributing to magazines, I did work on several pictures by an independent outfit. I also wrote plays, but I would say that my first formal connection with motion pictures was around 1935 or 1936, when I came out to Hollywood.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you a member of the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. STRAWN. Yes, I am.
Mr. WHEELER. What stories or scripts have you written that were made into motion pictures ?
Mr. STRAWN. Do you want them all?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. STRAWN. Well, you have had, probably, more impressive lists than mine. I did the original story and joint screen play on The Black Room for Columbia. I did a joint screen play for The Man Who Lived Twice. I also worked on a joint screen play called Lady in Distress. I also did added scenes for Don't Gamble with Love. I did the original story Here Comes the Girls. I also worked on a joint screen play entitled "Road Agent." Another joint screen play entitled "The Enemy Meets Ellery Queen." I did another joint screen play called Eyes of the Underworld. That brought me up to the war and I was sick, recovering from a minor operation, when the Japs hit us at Pearl Harbor, but I immediately began to correspond to see if there was any way I could get into the service. By the time I had recovered from the operation, and the Screen Writers' Guild knew of my desire to serve, I was notified that there was a representative out here from the Air Force, and I went to see him. I was interviewed by him and he thought that he could use me and could get me a commission, but he asked me if I couldn't get a commission whether I would be willing to serve in a civilian capacity. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2055 I said that I would be willing to serve in any capacity. So he wired me later and said that there was no commission for me, but would I come on anyway. I wired back, "Name the date and I will come on," and I did. So I went back to Wright Field and worked in a civilian capacity.
Mr. WOOD. What was the nature of your work?
Mr. STRAWN. I wrote, directed, and produced motion pictures for the war effort, and for the Air Force. Someone in Washington, going over the work in that unit, singled my work out as the most professional work and wanted to know why I wasn't commissioned and came back and said that they had better commission me before they lose me, because as a civilian I wasn't obliged to stay there, so they promptly put through a commission to keep me with the unit. I served for several years, until I was disabled and discharged from the service.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your rank?
Mr. STRAWN. I was a captain.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you discharged? 
Mr. STRAWN. I was discharged out of the Birmingham Hospital here, I believe, around August of 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. From what period of time were you a civilian employee of the Air Corps?
Mr. STRAWN. I went in around June, following Pearl Harbor, and they commissioned me about 4 months later, right after my first scripts were seen in Washington. I remained until my discharge, which was, approximately, August of 1944, I believe.
Mr. WooD. Did you say that you were disabled while you were in the service?
Mr. STRAWN. Yes. 
Mr. WOOD. What sort of disability was that?
Mr. STRAWN. I had internal injuries and was operated on. I volunteered for overseas duty in fact, I was seeking overseas duty and in the course of a routine overseas examination they discovered that I had hurt myself so they sent me to a hospital and I was operated on. There they found other things wrong and discharged me after 4 or 5 months in the hospital.
Mr. WHEELER. What has your employment been after your discharge from the Air Corps?
Mr. STRAWN. I wrote a play which was produced in New York. Let me refresh my memory for just a moment. Then I sold several original stories.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the name of the play and the names of the stories?
Mr. STRAWN. The play was called Sleep No More which was subsequently bought by Universal. That was a comedy. Then I sold some original stories. One was called Blossoms for Effie and another one called Affairs of Geraldine, and for Monogram Studios I did a rewrite on Bad Men of Tombstone and then I did an original, sold an original screen play called Hiawatha, and another one called Flight to Mars. That just about brings it up to date. Flight to Mars was completed last December, I would say; approximately that time. Previously I had had another play produced in the East, See No Evil, and another play of mine which was called Anthony Nero. That 2056 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY was twice given a full length hour and one-half production by the British Broadcasting Corp., on television, which was an unusual distinction to get a full-length play like that shown. I have contributed articles and stories to the New Yorker and the American Mercury and the Herald Tribune magazine section. I have also contributed stories to the Screen Writer, the Saturday Evening Post, and E-quire. Perhaps there may be more.
Mr. WHEELiER. As a writer, you register all manuscripts with the Screen Writers' Guild; is that correct?
Mr. STRAWN. You mean original manuscripts?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. STRAWN. As a rule, yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What manuscripts have you registered during the year 1949 ?
Mr. STRA.WN. I would have to check with the Screen Writers' Guild records on that. What manuscripts have I registered, you say?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes, in the year 1949.
Mr. STRAWX. I frankly don't recall at the moment. I could check their records and find out for you, if you want that.
Mr. WHiEELER. Do you recall a manuscript entitled "Twilight Street"?
Mr. STR kw-. Yes; I recall that manuscript.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember registering that with the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. STRAwx. I very likely did.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you write this manuscript in conjunction with another author?
Mr. STRAWN. Do you mind if I consult with my counsel?
Mr. WOOD. You have a right to confer with your counsel any time you desire. You can retire from the room if you care to.
Mr. STRAWN. I think these gentlemen are trying to link me with someone else, who has been mentioned in the hearings. I find that I must refuse to answer under the fifth amendment, on the ground that my answer might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. WOOD. You have not been asked to identify any person at all. You were asked if you wrote it in connection with any other person. No one has been named as yet. Did you write it by yourself ?
Mr. STRAWN. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. With whom did you write it?
Mr. STRAWN. I claim the fifth amendment on that, too.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know J. Redmond Prior?
Mr. STRAWN. Not that I recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know a J. R. Prior, P-r-i-o-r?
Mr. STRAWN. Wait a minute. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. WHEELER. I have a document here, Mr. Chairman, which was subpenaed from the Screen Writers' Guild It is a registration certificate with the Screen Writers' Guild, where the writers in Hollywood register articles or scripts with the Screen Writers' Guild. It bears the registration guild No. 41938. This form was filled out on 2-25-49. It is registered in the name of Arthur Strawn and J. R. Prior. The registration fee is indicated as $1 and the name of the manuscript is given as Twilight Street. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2057 I would like to show this to the witness and ask him if he can identify it as a registration certificate receipt, that he registered this at the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. STRAWN. Again I will have to claim the same privilege in not answering the question. What was the question again?
Mr. WHEELER. I asked you if you recognize that as a receipt you received when the manuscript was registered at the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. STRAWN. I can only recognize this as a receipt. I had better claim the same privilege on that.
Mr. WOOD. A moment ago, Mr. Strawn, you stated in response to a question as to whether or not you did register this particular script with the Screen Writers' Guild in 1949, you stated that you could investigate the records up there and determine the answer to that question. Now, having refreshed your recollection by being confronted with this record, do you state now that you did not register this?
Mr. STRAWN. You are making an error, I am afraid. I said that I would have to investigate. There could still be this receipt and it doesn't necessarily mean that I registered it or got the receipt.
Mr. WooD. That is what I am trying to find out now. Will you state whether you registered that or not, after having refreshed your recollection ?
Mr. STRAWN. I don't recall.
Mr. WOOD. Even after having seen this receipt?
Mr. STRAWN. I really don't recall.
Mr. WOOD. Was it ever registered e
Mr. STRAWN. Obviously it must have been.
Mr. WOOD. Did anyone else have any interest in this except yourself. in this registration?
Mr. STRAWN. Wasn't that question asked before and answered?
Mr. WIHEELER. Not the same question, I don't believe.
Mr. WooD. You were asked if you wrote it by yourself and you said you didn't and now I am asking you if anyone had any interest in it but you.
Mr. STRAWN. If someone else wrote it with me, then that person must, obviously, have an interest in registering it.
Mr. WOOD. That does not answer my question. Did anyone else have any interest in registering this except you?
Mr. STRAWs. Yes.
Mr. WooD. Could it have been possible the other person interested in the registration of it actually did the registering, or did you do that?
Mr. STRAWW.It could have been done by the other person.
Mr. WOOD. And it could have been done by either of you; is that right'
Mr. STRAWN. Yes.
Mr. Woon You say you have no independent recollection of who did it; is that right?
Mr. STRAWN. My answer was that I do not recall having registered it myself.
Mr. WOOD. Do you recall anyone else having registered it?
Mr. STRAWN. No; but I assume that it was registered by someone else. 93012-52-lit 6--2 2058 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. WOOD. Proceed. 
Mr. WHEELER. The logical person to register this would have been J. R. Prior, he having an interest in the manuscript?
Mr. STRAWN. I will have to claim the same privilege, because I think this is an attempt to get me to incriminate myself.
Mr. WHEELER. Isnt' it a fact that J. Redmond Prior is Lester Cole?
Mr. STRAWN. In view of the fact that he has been rather prominently labeled as subversive, and so on, by this committee, I will have to claim my privilege for the reasons given, because I think it is an attempt to link me up with someone who has been incriminated and I am afraid the answer to that question might tend fo incriminate me.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Lester Cole?
Mr. STRAWN. I will make the same answer to that question.
Mr. WHEELER. You mentioned previouslyMr. STRAWN. May I interrupt and say that any question which I feel is in any way an attempt to link me with any organization or any individual, that I understand to have been listed as subversive by this committee, that I do not careMr. WOOD. Let me set you straight about that right now. This committee has listed no one as subversive.
Mr. STRAWN. I have seen printed lists of organizations.
Mr. WOOD. I am talking about individuals.
Mr. STRAWN. Individuals connected with those organizations or who have been subpenaed or cited for contempt, any attempt to link me with any of those people I am going to, in that connection, claim the same privilege because I feel that it represents an attempt to incriminate me.
Mr. WHEELER. You previously stated, in your testimony, that you were the author of a story called Bad Men of Tombstone.
Mr. STRAWN. That is right; yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was that sold directly to Monogram or do you still have a percentage of the picture?
Mr. STRAWN. I do not have any percentage of the picture.
Mr. WHEELER. In other words, you sold it outright to Monogram?
Mr. STRAWN. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. Then tell us the mechanics of that.
Mr. STRAWN. Monogram had a picture with that title or some approximate title, and they wanted rewriting done on the version that they had. I was engaged to do some rewriting on this.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you do the rewriting yourself or in conjunction with another party?
Mr. STRAWN. I did it in conjunction with another party.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was the other party ?
Mr. STRAWN. I will have to decline to answer that question on the grounds already stated.
Mr. WHEELER. Wasn't J. R. Prior or J. Redmond Prior also engaged on that?
Mr. STRAWN. I will make the same answer to that question.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Strawn, have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. STRAWN. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds as heretofore stated. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2059 
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. STRAWN. I decline to answer on the grounds that I think the answer might tend to incriminate me and therefore I stand on my privilege not to answer.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. I have no questions.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, perhaps there is a question or two that I should ask. You are here under subpena, are you not?
Mr. STRAW. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce this document as Strawn exhibit No. 1 for the record.
Mr. WOOD. It will be admitted as Strawn exhibit No. 1. (The document referred to was marked as "Strawn Exhibit No. 1.")
Mr. WOOD. Is there anything further?
Mr. WHEELER. I have nothing further.
Mr. KENNY. May this witness be excused now?
Mr. WooD. Yes; he may be excused. (Whereupon the witness was excused.) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 6 MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1951 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN AcTivrrlES, Los Angeles, Calif.
