Mr. WHEELER. Were you born on July 28, 1881?
Mr. PROKOP. That is right.
Mr. WHEELER. You entered the United States September 30, 1930?
Mr. PROKOP. That is right-the United States, you say?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. PROKOP. September 1, 1913, not 1930.

Mr. PROKOP. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you naturalized?
Mr. PROKOP. About 14 years ago.
Mr. WHEELER. On February 10, 1939, you received your final papers? 2118 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. PROKOP. Yes; I do think it was earlier but I would have to look it up.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your present address?
Mr. PROKOP. I have two addresses; one business and one home address.
Mr. WHEELER. We would like both.
Mr. PROKOP. The business address is 10974 West Pico; the home address is 12033 Goshen Avenue.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you a member of the Communist Party, Mr. Prokop ?
Mr. PROKOP. I am not a member(The witness consulted with counsel.)
Mr. PROKOP. If I may claim the privilege and retract that, I prefer to claim the privilege, if I can.
Mr. JACKSON. I presume that counsel's remarks were directed to the witness' constitutional rights?
Mr. MARGOLIS. You have no right to assume anything, especially what my remarks might have been to the witness. I was just consulting with my client.
Mr. JACKSON. Your client did not ask for any consultation. Now, he has been subpenaed here to answer certain questions.
Mr. MARGOLIS. I consulted with him and I am his attorney and have a right to do so.
Mr. JACKSON. At the point where the witness was about to make his answer to the question, that had been directed by the investigator, the record should show that counsel intervened and a discussion took place, following which the witness claimed the privilege of the fifth amendment.
Mr. MARGOOLIs. The record should also show that no one could understand what he said and it can also show that I advised him and it can also show I will not tolerate any inquiry as to what I said to my client by anyone.
Mr. J.wKSON. No one is inquiring into your discussion with your client. I am merely making the point, that from this time on, if the witness-and I want the witness to make note of this-if there is any question in your mind, as to whether or not you should answer a question, you have the right to ask your counsel for advice. Do you understand that ?
Mr. PROKOP. Yes; thank you.
Mr. JACKSON. When counsel is requested for advice it is the privilege and the right, your privilege and right, to request such advice on questions which are not clear to you, and on questions which you may want to discuss with counsel. As you very well know, counsel is not here as an ironclad right, and I would so advise counsel. There have been many occasions in the past when witnesses have not been permitted counsel. Continue, if you will.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you also known as Jack Frank?
Mr. PROKOP. I will claim the privilege.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been known as Jack Prokop?
Mr. PROKOP. That is my business name, yes, by the advice of the immigration authorities.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party before you entered the United States? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2119 
Mr. PROKOP. No; not at all.
Mr. JACKSON. You were not a member of the Communist Party before you entered the United States?
Mr. PROKOP. Not at all; no.
Mr. WHEELER. According to the records of the committee, Jack Prokop held Communist book No. 74742, under the name of Jack Frank, in Hollywood unit J-9 in 1937. Would you like to affirm or deny that ?
Mr. PROKOP. I will not answer under the privilege.
Mr. JACKSON. On the grounds of possible self-incrimination?
Mr. PROKOP. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. I would suggest to counsel, if refusals are stated on the grounds previously stated, rather than trying to go through the whole formality-Mr. MARGOLIS. I would have suggested it, that he just state that he is not answering the question on the grounds previously stated, but I didn't want to be thrown out of here. I didn't want to consult with him unless he asked me a question.
Mr. JACKSON. I suggest that for the benefit of the witness, in view of his speech difficulty. You have already stated your refusal to answer several questions on the grounds of possible self-incrimination. If there are other questions which you do not wish to answer, it will be sufficient if you will decline to answer on the grounds already stated.
Mr. PROKOP. Thank you.
Mr. WHEELER. Our records also reflect that in 1934 and 1935, you were assigned to unit J-6 and unit J-4, under the party name of J. Frank, in the Communist Party, in the city of Los Angeles; is that correct ?
Mr. PROKOP. I claim the privilege previously stated.
Mr. MARGOLIS. I might explain that his English is not too good,
Mr. Jackson. I think it is clear that he intends to claim the privilege under the fifth amendment.
Mr. JACKSON. We will do what you lawyers call, so stipulate.
Mr. WHEELER. Our records also disclose that in 1945 you were a member of the Benjamin Franklin Communist Club in the city of Los Angeles; is that correct?
Mr. PROKOP. I claim the same privilege.
Mr. WHEELER. You are making the same answer to that question ?
Mr. PROKOP. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you acquainted with Wilma Solomon?
Mr. PROKOP. I don't know any such person ?
Mr. WHEELER. You don't know any such person ?
Mr. PROKOP. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been in her home ?
Mr. PROKOP. Wilma Solomon's home?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. PROKOP. I really don't know or don't remember.
Mr. WHEELER. She resides at 10513 Holman Avenue in West Los Angeles.
Mr. PROKOP. I don't remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Her husband's name is Lou Solomon; lie is a writer in the motion-picture industry.
Mr. PROKOP. That is strange to me. 2120 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY

Mr. WHEELER. Your business is located in West Los Angeles; is it not?
Mr. PROKOP. Yes; on Pico Boulevard.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend any Communist Party meetings in West Los Angeles?
Mr. PROKOP. I claim the privilege.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you deny that you know any of these individuals that I have mentioned?
Mr. PROKOP. That is right.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions.
Mr. JACKSON. Your subpena will be extended and in the meantime,
Mr. Margolis, if your client moves from his place of residence or his place of business will you notify Mr. Wheeler here at the hotel in order that we can contact him, if it is our desire to so do?
Mr. MARGOLIS. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Who is the next witness?
Mr. WHEELER. Hannah Schwartz Donath.
Mr. JACKSON. Mrs. Donath, will you stand and be sworn, please? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mrs. DoNATH. I do. TESTIMONY OF HANNAH SCHWARTZ DONATH, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT W. KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS
