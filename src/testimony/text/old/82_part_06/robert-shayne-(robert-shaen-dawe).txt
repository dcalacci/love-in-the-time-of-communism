Mr. WHEELER. Will you please state your full name.
Mr. SHAYNE. Robert Shayne.
Mr. WHEELER. Is that your professional name?
Mr. SHAYNE. That is my professional name.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your true name ?
Mr. SHAYNE. R bert Shaen Dawe, D-a-w-e.
Mr. WHEELER. When and where were you born?
Mr. SHAYNE. I was born October the 4th, 1900, in Yonkers, N. Y.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you give us a brief r6sum6 of your educational background.
Mr. SHAYNE. I went through high school in Washington, D. C., and 2 years of Boston University in business administration and one summer course at Chicago University.
Mr. WHEELER. What has been your employment record since leaving school?
Mr. SHAYNE. Oh, it has been quite varied. 2091 2092 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. WHEELER. Well, briefly.
Mr. SHAYNE. The last 25 years-nearly 25 years-I have been an actor.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you relate briefly what studios you have been under contract for.
Mr. SHAYNE. The only studio I have been under contract for is Warner Bros. I came out here in February of 1943 under contract to them, and that contract was terminated in July 1945. I have been a free-lance actor ever since.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently employed? 
Mr. SHAYNE. No. Well, I am and I am not. You cut me out of a job by subpenaing me today.
Mr. WHEELER. Who is your agent ?
Mr. SHAYNE. Mr. Sam Armstrong.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Shayne, during the investigation in Hollywood, information has been developed that you were at one time a member of the Communist Party. Is that a statement of fact?
Mr. SHAYNE. One time a member ?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. SHAYNE. That is a statement of fact, yes. I was a member of the Communist Party back in 1935, if you want to call it that, in New York City during the depths of the depression. I was not a member any longer, I suppose, than-oh, a few weeks or a few months. In 1936 I tore up my card and never paid dues to the organization. I don't imagine I attended more than-oh, a half a dozen meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you a member of the Screen Actors' Guild?
Mr. SHAYNE. That's correct.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever hold any offices in the Screen Actors' Guild?
Mr. SHAYNE. I was on the board of directors of the Screen Actors' Guild at one time.
Mr. WHEELER. What year was that? You were appointed to the board on March 4, 1945; is that right?
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, that sounds right. I am not sure.
Mr. WIIEELER. Then in September 1945, you ran for office and were elected to the board for a period of 1 year ?
Mr. SH vYNE. That sounds right, yes.
Mr. WHErLER. All right. The following year you didn't run. Could you tell us why ?
Mr. SHAYIE. I was not nominated by the nominating committee.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, did you have any discussion with anybody in the Screen Actors' Guild that requested you not to run ?
Mr. SHAYNE. Requested me not to run?
Mr. WHEELER. That's right.
Mr. SHAYNE. No. So far as I can recall, there was no request made for me not to run. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party in Hollywood?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir. Unqualifiedly, unequivocally, no, and I am not interested in becoming a member of the Communist Party at any time in the future.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, let's go back to 1935. Will you relate the circumstances, how you became a member. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2093 
Mr. SITAYNE. Well, it is very difficult to bring back all the circumstances of 16 years ago, Mr. Wheeler. It would be impossible for me to do so accurately. I will do so to the best of my ability.
Mr. WHEELER. To the best of your ability, yes.
Mr. SIIAYNE. If you will recall the emotional excitement of 1934 and 1935 and all those years in there when we were in the midst of a terrible depression, unemployment was quite rampant, and those circumstances were not peculiar to the acting profession any more than they were to any other field of activities in the United States, and I was one of the ones who was suffering a great deal of unemployment, and there were no minimum wages, no pay for rehearsals, and no adequate protection against being fired from a part by a producer and to replace you with an ac tor at a lower salary if the play was a success, and there was considerable agitation among members of the Actors' Equity Association, of course, if you recall that climate for those things, and during the course of that-during that period I must have run into somebody who thought I was a ripe plum for picking and, in any event, I was given a copy by somebody of a book called The Coming Struggle for Power by Strachey. I forget his first name. John, or something.
Mr. JACKSON. John Strachey.
Mr. SHAYNE. John Strachey, and it made quite an impression on me, and one thing led to another, and I was invited down to the Workers' School by somebody-I don't remember whom-on Twelfth Street or Fourteenth; somewhere in that area. I went to a number of courses-rather, classes, and was, I suppose you would call it, indoctrinated. In any event, after some period of time-I suppose it was 2 or 3 months-it was suggested that I join the Party, that that was a good way to get the things that the actors were working for. So I, being fairly gullible, must have signed a card or an application, because to all intents and purposes, so far as I know, I became a member. I was given a card, but I destroyed that card some months later and, as I say, I never paid dues in the Party because I quickly became disillusioned with the secrecy of the whole procedure and the fact that I was supposed to give a fictitious, and 1 believe I did give a fictitious name, but that completely disillusioned me, and I have never been interested or at all active in any Communist Party activity since the spring of 1936.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who actually recruited you in the movement at that time?
Mr. SIIAYNE. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the members of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. You recall no one.
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir. That was 16 years ago.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Anti-Nazi League ?
Mr. SHATNE. No.
Mr. WHEELER. The Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions?
Mr. SITAYNE. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. Hollywood Democratic Committee?
Mr. SIIAYNE. No, sir. 2094 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. WHEELER. Hollywood Motion Picture Democratic Committee?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. Arts, Sciences, and Professions?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. People's Educational Center?
Mr. SHAYNE. I went to school there once 3 or 4 years ago and took .a screen-writing course, but that's all.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructor was?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. May we have a few minutes recess, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. JACKSON. Yes; declare a 5-minute recess. If you [addressing witness] will hold yourself available outside the committee room, please. (A short recess was taken.)
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Shayne, you say that at the time of the service of the subpena you had some work which was effective and that you were out of a job as a result of the service of this subpena?
Mr. SIIAYNE. That's correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Where was that job?
Mr. SHAYNE. I was employed at Superman Productions, television film over at the RKO-Pathe Studios. My producers told me that they asked for a postponement so that I could do the job yesterday, today, and tomorrow, but if they talked with someone it was declined.
Mr. WHEELER. They didn't talk to me.
Mr. SHAYNE. I might add that while you are asking me this, that I consider the way the subpena was served upon me as not in the best of, let us say, spirit.
Mr. JACKSON. We have tried serving subpenas in the best of spirit on a number of people. The next we hear of them they are in Mexico or France, or something.
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, the point I want to make is that the subpena had my residence address on it. I could have been served out there just as easily without it being brought to such-the attention of studio employees, because the fact that a person is called before this committee, although they may be friendly or not, far too often is tantamount to being guilty of something or other, whatever that may be.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, of course, the assumption or any assumptions that are left in the minds of the American people as a refusal of witnesses to testify is a logical assumption and, more often than not, correct. At least, that has been our experience in the committee. We certainly have no desire to persecute or prosecute anyone.
Mr. SHAYNE. I have no employment.
Mr. JACKSON. Instead of blaming the committee, I think a lot of the witnesses would be well advised to blame themselves for not looking around to see where they were going some years ago. However, that is not in line with the questioning I wanted to continue. You say that you don't know who recruited you into the party ?
Mr. SHAYNE. I do not remember, no.
Mr. JACKSON. How many meetings did you attend during the course of time you were a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHAYNE. I think I answered that. So far as I can recall, it must have been a half a dozen.
Mr. JACKSON. Where were these meetings held, Mr. Shayne? COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2095 
Mr. SHAYNE. In homes in New York City.
Mr. JACKSON. In whose homes?
Mr. SIIAYNE. I don't remember.
Mr. JACKSON. You mean you left your place of residence and started out for a home, not knowing to whom that home belonged?
Mr. SHATNE. Oh, no, naturally not, but I say I cannot remember whose home it was 16 years later. 
Mr. JACKSON. Were these people with whom you were associated in the party all members of the acting profession?
Mr. SHAYNE. That I couldn't say. I don't know.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you know whether any of them were connected with the acting profession ?
Mr. SI AYNE. Some of them said they were, but I didn't know them.
Mr. JACKsoN. Did you ever meet John Garfield during that period of time ?
Mr. SIIAYNE. Not during that period of time, no.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you later meet John Garfield? 
Mr. SITAYNE. I must know half of the people in Hollywood as a result of my working in pictures and in 9 years-Mr. JACKSON. Did you meet Mr. Garfield in Hollywood? 
Mr. SH \YNE. I met Mr. Garfield when he was under contract at the Warner Bros. lot when I was also there under contract.
Mr. JACKSON. Now, I believe you stated that you took a course at the People's Educational Center.
Mr. SHAYNE. That's correct.
Mr. JACKSON. You took a course in what?
Mr. SiHAYNE. In screen writing.
Mr. JACKSON. In screen writing?
Mr. SHAYNE. Yes. 
Mr. J\ACKSON. How many classes did you attend in that course?
Mr. SJIAYNE. I attended one term. I suppose it was a half a year or semester, whatever you call it.
Mr. JACKSON. Who gave that course? 
Mr. SHAiiYNE. I don't remember the instructor's name.
Mr. JACKSON. You attended a half a semester? 
Mr. SHAYNE.
Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. SHAYNE.
Mr. JACKSON. That's correct. In a class in screen writing? That is correct. And you have no recollection of- 
Mr. SHAYNE. All I can remember is that it was a woman, but I don't remember her name.
Mr. JACKSON. Was this the same instructor over that period?
Mr. SHAYNE. I think so, yes. 
Mr. J.\CKisoN. Well, Mr. Shayne, that to me is an astounding statement, that a man of intelligence could attend a semester in a class in screen writing and during all that period of time not come to know the name of the instructor.
Mr. SII.xYNE. Well, I don't think there is anything astounding about it, sir. It was 5 years ago, or thereabouts. I can't remember the names of everybody I meet or everybody I have come in contact with any more than you can.
Mr. J CKisoN. Mr. Shayne, I remember the teachers who taught me in the fifth grade. 2096 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, you have a remarkable memory for that sort of thing. I apparently don't.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, I beg to differ with you on that particular point. Did you also attend, you say, the Workers' School?
Mr. SHAYNE. In New York, yes.
Mr. JACKSON. In New York?
Mr. SHAYNE. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Not in Los Angeles?
Mr. SHAYNE. Not in Los Angeles.
Mr. JACKSON. How lon" did you attend the Workers' School?
Mr. SIIAYNE. Well, as said before, I don't recall the exact time, but as near as I can recall it must have been-oh, 3 or 4 months.
Mr. JACKSON. What particular studies were you pursuing in the Workers' School?
Mr. SHAYNE. It was just a general lecture course.
Mr. JACKSON. A general lecture course?
Mr. SHAYNE. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you recall the names of any of them who gave lectures during the period of time you were in attendance ?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir, I don't.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you ever know a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHAYNE. Did I ever know one?
Mr. JACKSON. Did you ever know of your own knowledge a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, the people that procured me must have been, but what their names are, as I say, I don't remember. Since I have been out here in Hollywood I couldn't tell you who was a member of the Communist Party or who wasn't. I have no knowledge, because I do not-I have not discussed politics or political affiliations with anybody.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, how about the period of time you were in New York? Did you know of your own personal knowledge any individualMr. SHAYNE. Not that I can recall, no, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you in the Armed Forces?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you been in the Armed Forces ?
Mr. SHAYNE. I am 50 years of age.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, as I say, we have no desire to persecute anyone in the course of this investigation, and these preliminary hearings are for the purpose of setting out our agenda for the open hearings which are to start next Monday, and the extent of the cooperation given by witnesses in the preliminary hearings is largely to be the yardstick of whether or not they are to appear at the open hearings. Now, I personally feel, Mr. Shayne, that you have not been completely frank with the subcommittee.
Mr. SHAYNE. I don't see how you can say so. I have been perfectly frank. I am perfectly willing to be frank with you. I have been honest with you. I don't know how else I could be.
Mr. JACKSON. I repeat that one semester in screen writing under an instructor is, to me, a glaring inconsistency when one is unable to tell the name. The name might necessarily connote nothing. It does not necessarily say that the instructor was a Communist or hav- COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2097 ing anything to do with the Communist Party. I can appreciate the reluctance of anyone to name names, but that is, to my mind, a glaring inconsistency in your testimony. If, in the course of the next few days, you change your residence, will you please keep Mr. Wheeler informed as to where you can be reached ?
Mr. SHAYNE. I don t intend to change my residence.
Mr. JACKSON. Some people do. We have just had a witness in who did intend to change, so I merely throw that in so that you will hold yourself available for the committee.
Mr. SHAYNE. If you had a list of the faculty of the People's Educational Center, it is very possible that, looking down that list, I might be able to pick out the name, but I have no such list.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know whether the instructor who gave the course in screen writing was connected with the motion-picture industry in any capacity?
Mr. SHAYNE. She was supposed to be connected with the industry as a screen writer somewhere, but I don't know where or what studio.
Mr. JACKSON. Weren't you at all concerned about the capacity of the instructor to instruct in screen writing? Didn't it occur to you that possibly you would like to have someone who had a background in screen writing?
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, naturally, yes; but I had had no training in writing and I wasn't particularly concerned about the great skill of the instructor. I wanted to get the rudiments or elements, and this course had been recommended to me by somebody and I just accepted the recommendation.
Mr. JACKSON. How many people were there in this class, Mr. Shayne?
Mr. SHAYNE. Oh, there must have been a couple of dozen, I guess.
Mr. JACKSON. They went through the course in screen writing?
Mr. SHAYNE. I don't know how far they went. I only took one semester.
Mr. JACKSON. How long was one semester?
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, the usual period of a semester, which is a half of an academic year.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you recall the names of any who took the course at the same time you did ?
Mr. SHAYNE. No, sir. I went alone. I don't know who any of the students were or what has become of them. I know nothing about them.
Mr. JACKSON. Is there any reason why the witness should not be excused for the present?
Mr. WHEELER. None at all.
Mr. JACKSON. Then you are excused, Mr. Shayne, and if you will, if you anticipate being out of the city, communicate with Mr. Wheeler. It will be very much appreciated.
Mr. SHAYNE. May I ask, Is there any compensation for appearing before this committee?
Mr. WHIEELER. He is entitled to transportation to and from his residence.
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, that is only gasoline mileage but, as I said before, your subpena has lost me employment during these 3 day,, which I cannot make up. 2098 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. WHEELER. In regard to that, we received no communications whatsoever from your producer requesting a postponement. I am quite sure that arrangements could have been worked out so that you could have worked this period of 3 days if we would have been contacted, because we certainly don't want anybody to lose their employment, and I was not contacted and Congressman Jackson was not contacted.
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, my producer said that he contacted someone. He didn't tell me who.
Mr. WHEELER. He certainly didn't contact the committee who has jurisdiction over these matters, because if he had we would have certainly been in communication with you or your producer.
Mr. SHAYNE. Then, may I ask you this: Am I free to accept employment next Monday?
Mr. WHEELER. You are free to accept employment any time.
Mr. SHAYNE. Well, now, suppose I am subpenaed for these public hearings?
Mr. JACKSON. You will be notified in sufficient time. If you are subpenaed for the public hearings, we will make every effort to set it at such a time as will not conflict with any obligations you may have in employment.
Mr. SHAYNE. Of course, being a free-lance actor, I never know when I am going to work more than a day or two in advance.
Mr. JACKSON. Will you try to let us know whether or not, if you do receive an offer of employment-it might be a good idea for him to communicate with you.
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. SHAYNE. Where can you be reached, Mr Wheeler?
Mr. WHEELER. Hollywood Roosevelt.
Mr. SHAYNE. In this hotel?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Thank you, Mr. Shayne.
Mr. SHAYNE. Thank you.
Mr. JACKSON. Will you call the next witness, Mr. Wheeler.
Mr. WHEELER. Mendell Morton Krieger.
Mr. JACKSON. Will you stand and be sworn, please ? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Dr. KRIEGER. I do. TESTIMONY OF MENDELL MORTON KRIEGER ,
