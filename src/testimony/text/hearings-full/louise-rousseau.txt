Miss ROUSSEAU. I am.
Mr. WOOD. Will counsel please identify themselves for the record.
Mr. KENNY. Robert W. Kenny and Ben Margolis, both of Los Angeles.
Miss ROUSSEAU. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit a statement, if I may.
Mr. WooD. Very well, the statement will be received. 
Mr. Counsel, are you ready to proceed now ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir, I am.
Mr. WOOD. Very well.
Mr. TAVENNER. Apparently the photographers have not yet com- pleted their chores. What is your name, please?
Miss ROUSSEAU. My name is Louise Rousseau. 1740 
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss or Mrs.?
Miss ROUSSEAU. Miss.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession, please?
Miss ROUSSEAU. I am a writer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a writer engaged in the moving-picture industry?
Miss ROUSSEAU. I was until I received my subpena.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell your last name. I understand there is some discussion.
Miss ROUSSEAU. R-o-u-s-s-e-a-u. It's an old French name.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you worked in the moving-picture industry as a writer?
Miss ROUSSEAU. Since 1943 or 1944. I'm not sure which. Somewhere in there.
Mr. TAVENNER' What have been some of your screen credits ?
Miss ROUSSEAU. I write westerns as a whole. The other day I tried to remember them all but I found it impossible. Mostly they are written by a number, since they come under a series. I have written for Jimmy Wakely, Monte Hale, the Durango Kid, the Lone Ranger, and the Cisco Kid. I might say that most of these stories are based on actual incidents in the past relating to the struggles of the little people to overthrow the bigger people who try to stifle them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you make a brief statement to the committee of your general educational background, please?
Miss ROUSSEAU. Yes. My general educational background began at the knee of my grandmother, who taught me to read and to write, and to have
Mr. TAVENNER. It is not necessary to go into that detail. We have all gone through that experience.
Miss ROUSSEAU. This particular period happens to be the most important educational training of my life, She taught me family history. We were very proud of family history, my grandmother and I, because our ancestors came to this country in the year 1670 and they brought with them a great dream of freedom for the people of all beliefs.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are going rather far afield.
Miss ROUSSEAU. This is rather extremely important in my education, because my ancestors also signed the Constitution and fought for the Bill of Rights.
Mr. JACKSON. The witness' answers are covered in the statement.
Mr. WooD. Will you please answer the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. It would take a very long time to answer the question so I will ask you another question.
Miss ROUSSEAU. It will take a very brief time.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee has information that you were a member of the Hollywood section of the Los Angeles Communist Party in May 1947, and that your 1947 Communist Party book was No. 49869.
Miss ROUSSEAU. Under the first amendment of the Bill of Rights this committee nor any other committee of Congress has the right to ask me that question, because--Mr. WooD. We pass on the question of our right to ask it. The question is your right to answer it or not, as you see fit. What is your answer?  INDUSTRY 1741 
Miss ROUSSEAU. My answer is that I stand on the fifth amendment, which was originally written to implement the first amendment.
Mr. WOOD. We know what it was written for. Do you stand on the fifth amendment?
Miss ROUSSEAU. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Under that, do you decline to answer the question?
Miss ROUSSEAU. I decline to answer the question.
Mr. WooD. That simplifies the matter.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter?
Mr. WALTER. IS that the incorrect number of your book?
Miss ROUSSEAU. This is a question which I consider the same as the other question and I decline to answer it.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter?

Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WOOD. It is so ordered. The committee will stand in recess for 15 minutes pending the appearance of the witness that was called a little while ago. (Whereupon a recess was taken at this point.)
Mr. WOOD. Let us have order. Are you ready to proceed, Mr. Coun- sel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. I would like to call Dr. Murray Abowitz.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Abowitz, would you raise your right hand and be sworn, please, sir. You do solemnly swear the evidence you give this subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ? Dr. ABowrrz. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Dr. Abowitz, are you represented here by counsel? Dr. ABOWITZ. Mr. Kenny.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Kenny of the Los Angeles Bar ?
