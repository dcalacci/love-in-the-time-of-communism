Mr. DAHLSTEN. My name is Leonard Dahlsten.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel accompanying the witness please identify himself for the record.
Mr. MADDOX. Edward C. Maddox. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Dahlsten?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I was born on a farm in Nebraska in 1910.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now reside? 3882 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I reside in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in Los Angeles?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I have lived in Los Angeles about 15, 16 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I am a musician; at least up until now. I suppose I am blacklisted as of now. But I have made my living as a musician for all my life.
Mr. TAVENNER. During the period that you were making your living as a musician, were you a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I decline to answer that question for the following reasons: Number 1, I do not believe this committee has the power to investigate in this area where no legislation is possible or contemplated. Under the first amendment of the Constitution every citizen of this country is guaranteed the right of freedom of speech.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Maddox, we don't have time-we wish we did-to hear your speech. And so I am going to limit you to giving your legal reasons.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. Mr. Doyle, may I askMr. DOLE. That is all the time you are going to have. So let's make it clear and have an understanding. You give your legal reasons and we will give you reasonable time, but we are not going to give you time to make a speech to us.
Mr. MADDox. You addressed yourself to Mr. Maddox. Do you meanMr. DOYLE. I beg your pardon. I meant Mr. Dahlsten, the witness. I didn't mean Mr. Maddox. Thank you.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. Further, I believe that the duties of this committee are purely legislative, but they have taken on a punitive nature.
Mr. DOYLE. You heard what I said, Mr. Dahlstein, and I mean it. We ask-your cooperation. I will be reasonable. You have your constitutional rights, and plead them if you want to plead them. But we are not going to'give you time to tirade against the committee. Please cooperate.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I certainly wish to cooperate to that extent. I am not running for reelection in Congress in the district.
Mr. JACKSON. Why don't you try?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I might do that.
Mr. JACKSON. I think it would be an excellent idea.
Mr. DOYLE. We will have put out of the room anyone who makes an outburst, regardless of whether it is favorable or unfavorable. Proceed, Mr. Dahlsten, or we will have to excuse you from the chair if you are not ready to answer or to decline to answer on your legal reasons. I am sorry to disappoint you, not giving you time to make a speech.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. Under the first amendment, sirMr. DOYLE. You are entitled to plead it. Do you plead it?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I plead the first amendment, but may I explain?
Mr. DOYLE. No. We know what the first amendment is. The Supreme Court has explained it.
Mr. DAHLSTN. Being a musician, the first amendment is something special to me. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3883 
Mr. DoYLE. It doesn't mean anything different to you than to any other American citizen.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. Freedom of expression of a musician is an essential thing. Without freedom of expression there would be no music, there would be no art, no culture.
Mr. DoYLE. We recognize that amendment as you do. Do you plead the first amendment?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I say I do plead the first amendment.
Mr. DOYLE. Give any other legal reason you feel you have.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I plead the first amendment and I also plead the amendment which has been in the Constitution since the Bill of Rights was written, which was put there forMr. DOYLE. Which amendment is it, please?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. A specific purpose. I will identify it.
Mr. DOYLE. Identify it.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. As a union man, this amendment has a particular meaning because in the beginning of the trade-union movement this amendment was used as a protection when trade unions were considered subversive. This amendment was considered as a protection against the stool pigeons who were trying to destroy the unions.
Mr. DOYLE. What amendment do you intend to plead ? Plead it if you are going to.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. That, sir, is the fifth amendment. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. Now, Mr. Tavenner, you know better than to ask me that question. I have stated, at the outset, that I will not answer that question from the previouslyMr. TAVENNEE. There have been a great many people who have refused to answer questions on the basis of the fifth amendment on what had occurred in earlier dates, but who frankly told the committee they are not now members of the Communist Party in the case where that is true. So I want to give you that opportunity. Are you now a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I will not give up 1 inch of my rights as an American citizen under the Bill of Rights.
Mr. DOYLE. Any other questions, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. SCHERE. I think there should be a direction to answer the question.
Mr. JACKSON. As a matter of information, have you, in answer to the counsel's last question, refused to answer on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments?
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I think it is very clear that I have refused to answer that question on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. JACKSON. You had better make it abundantly clear by so stating.
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I may answerMr. JACKsoN. Just once more. 
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I refuse to answer the question on the basis of the first and fifth amendments. May I include the fourth, the ninth, and the tenth?
Mr. JACKSON. As far as I am concerned, you may include all of them that have not been repealed.
Mr. DOYLE. The 1st, 5th, 4th, 9th, and 10th. 3884 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a petition of the Independent Progressive Party of California which has been marked for identification purposes only as "Dahlsten Exhibit No. 1." Will you examine the affidavit appearing at the end of it, and state whether or not the name appearing there was written by you? (Document handed to the witness and his counsel.) (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. DAHLSTEN. I shall refuse to answer that question upon the grounds previously stated, and I furthermore say that if you want to not waste time, any question of this nature I will continue to refuse to answer on those two specific grounds, the first and the fifth amendments.
Mr. DOYLE. May it be understood that when the witness refuses to answer on constitutional grounds that it is on all of the grounds already stated. As counsel, is that acceptable, Mr. Maddox ?
Mr. MADDOx. Yes; if it is on constitutional grounds it is agreeable.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document referred to above,. marked "Dahlsten Exhibit No. 1" in evidence.
Mr. DOYLE. It is so ordered. (This exhibit is similar to Roth exhibit No. 2, p. 3860, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. TAVENNER. At the end of the petition there is an affidavit, Mr. Chairman, over the name of Leonard H. Dahlsten, in which it was stated, under oath, on the 29th day of December, 1947, that he was the person who solicited the signatures to this document. I now hand you a photostatic copy of a document marked for identification only as "Dahlsten Exhibit No. 2" which is an Affidavit of Registration under date of the 6th day of April 1948, in which it is declared that Leonard H. Dahlsten intends to affiliate with the Independent Party. Will you look at the signature appearing there and state whether or not it is your signature ? (Document handed to the witness and his counsel.)
Mr. DAHLSTEN. This is merely a duplication. I decline to answer that question on the previously stated grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document in evidence, as "Dahlsten Exhibit No. 2."
Mr. DOYLE. It is so received and so marked. (This document is similar to Roth exhibit No. 1, p. 3859, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. SCHERER. NO questions.
Mr. DOYLE.. The witness is excused.
Mr. MARGOLIs. I received a telephone call that you wanted Mr. Roth back on the stand, and want to advise you that, pursuant to that telephone call, I am here.
Mr. DOYLE. Have you had the benefit, Mr. Margolis, of consultation with your client ?
Mr. MARGOLIS. I have had the benefit of consultation, and, if you wish to proceed, we are ready to proceed. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3885 
Mr. TAVENNER. We will recall him. 
Mr. MARGOLIS. Do you wish to proceed at this time?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. DOYL. Will you please raise your right hand, Mr. Roth. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. ROTH. Yes, sir. TESTIMONY OF HENRY ROTH, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, BEN MARGOLIS-Resumed
Mr. DOYLE. May the record show that Mr. Roth, the witness earlier in the day, is again a witness under oath, at his request, and that he is accompanied by counsel, Mr. Margolis, who was counsel for him earlier in the day.
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Roth, a few minutes ago while you were in the hearing room, Mr. Lewis Elias, a witness unier oath before this committee, identified you as a member of the Communist Party. Did he lie to this committee when he so identified you ?
Mr. ROTHrn. Mr. Scherer, I answered before under oath all of those questions, all the questions of this type to you, and in my own way. If I may, and my counsel may, cross-examine this person as in a court at law we will then proceed. Otherwise I will not dignify what he has to say under the grounds of the first and fifth amendments. May I cross-examine him . May we cross-examine?
Mr. called under But SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, this man stood up in this room and
Mr. Roth, a witness, a liar. He is now given the opportunity oath to repeat that charge, and obviously he refuses to do so. I think we must have a direction, and I ask that you direct this witness to answer my question as to whether or notMr. ROTH. You have refused me the right to cross-examine.
Mr. SCHERER. I am not finished.
Mr. ROTH. You are finished. 
Mr. SCHERER. Whether or not Lewis Elias lied to this committee when he identified him as a member of the Communist Party. *Mr. ROTH. Sir, I answered those questions before, fully, and to your satisfaction because you dismissed me.
Mr. SCHERER. No; you did not answer them to my satisfaction.
Mr. ROTH. Not in the way you wished, but to your satisfaction as a member of this committee.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. Let it be understood that if he does not answer the question he has had ample opportunity to answer, and if he doesn't answer he should be dismissed.
Mr. DOYLE. So that there will be no misunderstanding of the circumstances which occurred, according to the record, I feel it is my duty and province to direct you to answer the question, and I do so.
Mr. ROTH. I answer the question in the same way that I did before. I refuse to answer it on the grounds of the first amendment and the fifth amendment. 3886 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA And, Mr. Scherer, this is not a Nazi camp yet. Don't talk to me that way. This is not a Nazi camp yet, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. Let the record show that the witnessMr. ROTH. Please put that in the record.
Mr. SCHERER. Let the record show that the witness' tone is exceptionally belligerent, and that his attitude is that of hateful.
Mr. ROTH. I affirm the tone of my voice.
Mr. SCHERER. That is all I want to know. We have already voted to recommend to the full committee that you be cited for contempt.
Mr. RoTH. I might add on, that I think this is a punitive, blacklisting committee. That is your function, and not a legislative function, in my opinion.
Mr. JACKSON. I ask the witness be excused. 
Mr. ROTH. Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. DonYL. If there is no further legal answer to the question, you are dismissed.
Mr. ROTH. Mr. Jackson, are you for subsidies for musicians, as you stated this morning? I would like that for the record because I think it is a very good thing if you are. I would be for you on this basis.
Mr. JACKSON. I don't recall what I said this morning.
Mr. ROTH. You said you thought subsidies were a good thing.
Mr. JACKSON. If I did recall, you would be the last one in the world at this moment with whom I would discuss it.
Mr. ROTH. Will you say it to the press, sir? Not to me. I don't care if you discuss with me.
Mr. JACKsON. Is it my understanding of the chairman's instructions that you are finished ?
Mr. ROTH. Thank you. 
Mr. JACKSON. You are quite welcome.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Victor Gottlieb. 
Mr. SCHERER. We have one more-Mr. Cyril Towbin. I wonder if he is ready with his lawyer.
Mr. MAGooLs. Towbin. Do you want Mr. Towbin back.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is all right with me. 
Mr. Don. He wanted to come back in your absence, and took the floor.
Mr. ToWBIN. I am sorry: I took the floor in answer to a question. I didn't ask to come back. I said if you call me I am ready to answer to anything that is honorable and honest. I just repeat that.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you take down what he said? Will you please read that?
Mr. SCHERER. Without reading what he stated, I am asking that he be recalled.
Mr. TowBIN. I am here, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. And that he be sworn. 
Mr. MARGOLIs. He has already been sworn.
Mr. DOYLE. He was dismissed before, Mr. Margolis. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. TOWBIN. I do, sir. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3887 TESTIMONY OF CYRIL TOWBIN, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, BEN MARGOLIS-Resumed
Mr. SCIERER. Mr. Towbin, you were in the hearing room a few minutes ago when the witness, Mr. Lewis Elias, under oath, identified you as a member of the Communist Party. Did Mr. Elias lie to this committee when he so identified you?
Mr. TowBnN. Mr. Scherer, it is your personal question. I answer you personally that I refuse to dignify anything that any informer will say against anybody by an answer, and that the history of informers is something that I refuse to have any respect for. If you choose to respect the words of informers I will have nothing to do with you; I will not cooperate with you, sir.
Mr. SCHERER. Let's keep the record. I ask for a direction that he be directed to answer the question.
Mr. TowBin. I have already(The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. DOYLE. If, by your answer to Mr. Scherer, you inferred that it was his personal question, I assure you it was not his personal question. It is his official question as a member of this committee. It was not his personal question, and I direct you to answer the question in view of what has occurred. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TowBIN. Mr. Doyle, in respect to your remarks, I will repeat the refusal to answer to the whole committee, to answer this question on the basis of the first amendment and on the basis of the fifth amendment which provides that no innocent person need testify against himself.
Mr. JACKSON. I ask the witness be excused.
Mr. DOYLE. The witness is excused.
Mr. TowBIN. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Victor Gottlieb.
