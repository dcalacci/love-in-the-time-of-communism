Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of an oath and affidavit and ask whether it was presented to you as a county employee and whether or not you refused to sign it as indicated by the stamp on the first page, the language of which-will you examine this, Mr. Wheeler? What is that language?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I must declineMr. TAVENNER. Just a minute.
Mr. WHEELER. "Refused to sign form."
Mr. TAVENNER. Which is stamped, "Refused to sign form"?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I must also refuse to answer the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you wish to state any grounds for refusal?
Mr. NATAPOFP. I refuse on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth amendment to the Constitution.
Mr. SCHERER. May I interrupt? Did your refusal to sign that form have anything to do with the loss of your job?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I must again refuse to answer that question for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you advised by the Communist Party or any Communist Party functionary not to execute that oath ?
Mr. NATAPOFF. That question is in the same area, and I refuse to answer that question for the same reasons on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. At a later date did you change your mind and in fact on the 29th day of April 1948 execute a similar oath? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. NATAPOFF. Do you want me to look at this before I answer?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, I think you should look at it to see whether you signed it. A signature is on the last page. I withdraw my question and place it in another way. Will you examine the document which I hand you and state whether or not the signature appearing on the last page was made by you? (Document handed to witness.) (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. NATAPOFF. I must refuse to answer that question for the same reasons, same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document in evidence and ask that it be marked "Natapoff Exhibit No. 1."
Mr. DOYLE. What about the first affidavit which was not signed? You have not offered that yet.
Mr. TAVENNER. I change the marking and offer the first exhibit presented as an exhibit and ask that it be marked "Natapoff Exhibit No. 1" and the latter marked "No. 2," for identification only.
Mr. DoYLE. As to Exhibit No. 1, it has been handed me, and across the face of it in rubber stamp is "Refused to sign form," and as I read it, I recognize it quickly as the oath that the person to whom it is submitted has never been or is not now a member since December 7, 1941, of any political party pr organization that advocates the overthrow of the (Government of the United States or the State of California or the county of Los Angeles by force and violence. That is the affidavit that the witness refused to sign.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party on the 29th day of April 1948, the date of the signed oath ?
Mr. NATAPOFF. It must be evident that by this time I refuse to answer any question of this nature on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth amendment. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1763 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do I understand that you are refusing then?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I am refusing. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you Kimple Exhibit No. 12 and ask you to examine it and state whether or not it is a receipt signed and delivered by you?
Mr. NATAPOFF. Do I have to touch it?
Mr. TAVENNER. Not if you can see it otherwise.
Mr. NATAPOFF. What is the question ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me ask you this: Have you touched it before?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I would not know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was not your Communist Party name Roth?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I refuse to answer that question for the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine the document and state whether you have ever seen it before ?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I refuse to answer that question for the same reasons, same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party on December 9,1937 ?
Mr. NATAPOFF. Before I answer, I just want to say that remark I made previously about touching that card. I did not want to touch it after a certain individual had handled it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Possibly it was just as obnoxious for him to touch it in the first place after he obtained it.
Mr. SCHERER. Obviously he is referring to Kimple. I have a question. Was anything that Officer Kimple said about you untrue?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I refuse to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. SCHERER. The fact is that everything he said was true, isn't it?
Mr. NATAPOFF. Are you asking me a question ?
Mr. SCHERER. Yes.
Mr. NATAPOFF. I refuse to answer. 
Mr. SCHERER. Who do you think we are going to believe, Witness?
Mr. TAVENNER. I am not certain that you understand the question that I asked you as to whether or not you were a member of the Communist Party on the 9th day of December 1937.
Mr. NATAPOFF. I refuse to answer any question in this area for the same reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist Party now?
Mr. NATAPOFF. I refuse to answer that question, same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Moulder?
Mr. MOULDER. No.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. NO.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. No.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you, Mr. Kenny and witness. You are excused.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Tashia Freed.
Mr. JACKSON. May I direct a question to the clerk of the committee?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes.
Mr. JACKsoN. Did the previous witness use the same pen? The CLERK. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. There was no hesitation in signing the voucher. 1764 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
