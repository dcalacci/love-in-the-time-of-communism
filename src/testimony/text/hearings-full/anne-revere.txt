Miss INDUSTRY 319 IRVERE. I like to think of myself as an actress. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please state in a general way your edu-cational background.
Miss REVERE. I was educated in the grammar schools and high .schools of Westfield, N. J., and went rom there immediately to Wellesley College, from which I graduated, receiving my B. A. -degree in 1926.
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your record of engagements as an .actress, briefly ?
Miss REVERE. Spotty, like all actresses.
Mr. TAVENNER. For whom have you worked?
Miss REVERE. Are you just interested in motion pictures, or would .you like my theater history ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Miss REVERE. I began in the theater many years ago. I presume that my most successful plays were Double Door and The Children's Hour, in which I had an extended engagement. I also established or helped to establish a theater, which I owned and operated, in Surrey, Maine. Subsequently, in 1934, I first came to Hollywood to do the picture version of Double Door, and then went back to New York. I have for approximately 11 years, I would say, been a resident 'of California, and during a great portion of that time. employed in the studios. . Mr. TAVENNER. About what year did your residence in California begin? 
Miss REVERE. Approximately, I think it was January 1940, as nearly as I remember?
Mr. TAVENNER. While in Hollywood were you a member of Actors' Laboratory, Inc. or affiliated with it in any way?
Miss REVE.
Mr. Tavenner and gentlemen, this would seem to me, ,based upon my observation in the course of the week in which I have listened to these testimonies, to be the first in a possible series *ofquestions which would attempt in some manner to link me with subversive organizations; and as the Communist Party is a political .party-legal political party-in this country today, and as I consider .any questioning regarding one's political views or religious views as .a violation of the rights of a citizen under our Constitution, and as I would consider myself, therefore, contributing to the overthrow of -our form of government as I understand it if I were to assist you in violating this privilege of mine and other citizens of this country, I respectfully decline to answer this question on the basis of the fifth amendment, possible self-incrimination, and also the first amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss Revere, the committee is in possession of information to the effect that you were the holder of a Communist Party registration card for the year 1945, bearing the number 47346, and that you also held a card for the year 1944, which bore the number 46937. Is that correct?
Miss REVERE. Could I see the card, gentlemen?
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recognize that card [handing document to witness] ?
Miss REVERE. As this would in effect constitute an answer to a question which I have already declined to answer for the reasons given, namely, that it is an invasion of the privileges and rights of a citizen, 320  I would respectfully decline to answer this question on the basis of possible self-inrimination. However, I do notMr. WooD. Do you refuse to answer for that reason
Miss REVERE. Yes. 
Mr. SIEGEL. May I consult with the witness for a moment, Mr. Tavenner 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. WooD. Proceed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss Revere, the committee also has information in the form of sworn testimony that you were a member of the Communist Party in Hollywood. Do you desire to either affirm or deny that statement ?
Miss REVERE. Again, Mr. Tavenner, I would claim my privilege under the fifth amendment and respectfully decline to answer such a question, on the basis of possible self-incrimination.
Mr. WOOD. Is it on that basis that you decline to answer?
Miss REVERE. Could I enlarge upon that answer, Mr. Wood? I would like to.
Mr. WooD. I just want to know if that is your reason for not answering.
Miss REVERE. That is my reason.
Mr. WooD. That is all the committee is interested in.
Mr. TAVEX-NER. Have you at any time been a member of the Communist Party ? 
Miss REVERE. It would seem to me, Mr. Tavenner, that that is anotherMr.. WOOD. Just answer or decline to answer.
Miss REVERE. I decline again, on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist 'Party at this time ?
Miss REVERE. That I also respectfully decline to answer, for the same reasons.
