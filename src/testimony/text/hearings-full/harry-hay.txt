Mr. HAY. My name is Harry Hay.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is noted you are accompanied by counsel. Will counsel please identify himself.
Mr. PESTANA. Frank Pestana, P-e-s-t-a-n-a.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Hay? 
Mr. HAY. April 7, 1912, in Worthing, England.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you first arrive in this country ?
Mr. HAY. My father and mother were American citizens at the time of my birth and the family returned to the United States at the end of 1916.
Mr. TAVENNER. Therefore you are an American citizen.
Mr. HAY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you now reside in Los Angeles
Mr. HAY. We came here to Los Angeles in 1916, and we have been here ever since.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation, please, sir?
Mr. HAY. I am a production control engineer.
Mr. TAVENNER. In what industry?
Mr. HAY. We make burners and boilers for basic industry. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1873 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been ?
Mr. HAY. Yes; I would say that in the beginning the position of production control engineer up until about 1947 or 1948 did not have regular university training so that my education for that is partly formal and partly applicatory in the field. I will do the best I can in that field, 6 years of grade school, 3 years of junior high school. Because I was graduated from high school before I was 14 I went through 3 years and dropped back and took 2 additional years of electives so I had 5 years of high school. Two years at Stanford; financial difficulties made it impossible for me to continue, so that in preparation for the type of work I do now, I had approximately 2 years in historical research, 1 year in record research, 1 year in market analysis, 1 year in actual practice as a foundry man, 3 years, 1 year in architecturalMr. TAVENNER. I didn't mean for you to go into the detail of stating your curriculum.
Mr. HAY. I suggested these things because to speak of yourself as a production control engineer without a degree sometimes seems a little strange. Would you like me to stop now?
Mr. TAVENNER. If you have covered in a general way, that is sufficient. If you have not, I don't want to limit you.
Mr. HAY. I would simply want to mention 3 years as a small tool analysis and material planning and 2 years in production planning.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you also engaged in the profession of teaching in addition to the other occupation which you mentioned? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. My Chairman, I must decline to answer that question on the first and the fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you had any training in music? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. I must decline to answer that question on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Investigation by the committee discloses that under the schedule of classes for the winter of 1950 of the California Labor School you were an instructor of a class in music and the people's struggle through the centuries. Did you actually teach such a course in the California Labor School? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. Mr. Chairman, I am compelled to answer by declining to answer your question for the reason of the first and the fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether the Communist Party in Los Angeles on the county level selected persons to teach in the California Labor School?
Mr. HAY. I beg your pardon. Is that the whole question?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. HAY. Would you repeat it?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, I will try to repeat it. Do you know whether or not the Communist Party in Los Angeles on a county level selected those who were to teach in the California Labor School?
Mr. HAY. I decline to answer that for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you given instructions by the Communist Party to conduct classes on any occasion? 1874 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. HAY. I decline for the same reasons, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Wereb who appeared as a witness yesterday, and also this morning, stated that you had been sent by the educational director of the Communist Party in Los Angeles to the Hawthorne Club of the Communist Party to give a course of instruction. Was that an accurate statement by him.
Mr. HAY. Mr. Chairman, you are asking me to give an opinion, I believe, in this case. I wish to state that I have neither opinions nor recollections to give to stoolpigeons and their buddies on this committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let's put the question in a different form. Were you instructed by the educational director of the Communist Party to conduct classes in the Hawthorne group of the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAY. I decline to answer that based upon the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCHERER. You called Mr. Wereb a stoolpigeon. Is anything he said about you untrue ? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. I decline to answer that based upon the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCHERER. It certainly comes with ill grace to tag a man like
Mr. Wereb as you have and then refuse to say whether what he said about you was untrue or not.
Mr. HAY. Mr. Chairman, this is your opinion. You may keep it
Mr. SCHERER. It certainly is and it is opinion founded on a little testimony and a little experience on this committee.
Mr. HAY. Mr. Chairman, some of the altercation that went on with the last witness-I might suggest a question in that direction.
Mr. DOYLE. May I have that statement What do you say, please?
Mr. HAY. In effect, Mr. Chairman, what I said a moment ago was that some of the altercation concerning the last witness in this chair might suggest a difference of opinion on that matter.
Mr. DOYLE. Altercation? I wasn't aware there was any altercation with the last witness.
Mr. SCHERER. I think I know what he means.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Hay, did you in January or February of 1947 conduct a Marxist school in Los Angeles?
Mr. HAY. I decline to answer that question based on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1947?
Mr. HAY. I decline for the same reasons, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Conununist Party?
Mr. HAY. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1950? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. I decline to state on the first and fifth amendments, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1954?
Mr. HAY. I decline to state on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party yesterday ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1875
Mr. HAY. I decline to state on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, is it just on Saturdays that you are not a member of the Communist Party ? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. I decline to answer that, Mr. Chairman, on the first and fifth amendments. 
Mr. TAVENNEE. Were you a member of the Communist Party this morning when you entered this hearing room? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. I decline to state on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS it a plan of the Communist Party that when a Communist Party member is called to testify before this committee that he is to deny membership for the period of time he is on the witness stand? (The witness conferred with his counsel.)
Mr. HAY. On the advice of counsel I decline to answer that one on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions. 
Mr. DOYLE. Any questions ?
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. No questions. 
Mr. DOYLE. No questions. Thank you very much. (Whereupon the witness was excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Martha Hard Wheeldin. 
Mr. DOYLE. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I do. 
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you. TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARTHA HARD WHEELDIN, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, EDWARD CARTER MADDOX
