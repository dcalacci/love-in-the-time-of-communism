Mrs. WHEELDIN. Martha Hard Wheeldin.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is noted you are accompanied by counsel. Will counsel please identify himself for the record.
Mr. MADDOx. Edward Carter Maddox. I practice law in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a native of California 
Mrs. WHEELDIN. In the interest of saving time for the committee, I understand you don't want to work after 12 o'clock- 
Mr. DOYLE. We will work as late as necessary. We have plenty of time to hear the witness fully. We would like to be out by 12. If it keeps us to 2 or 3 this afternoon, we will perform our duty so don't worry about that.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Well, I was going to say that in light of the nature of the inquiry-and I have been here and observed the nature of it throughout the week-that I do not intend to answer any of the type of questions that have been directed to various witnesses.
Mr. DOYLE. None has been directed to you yet, so please don't anticipate. We may change our line of questions as to you.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Any further questions that are not in the same nature of inquiry would therefore be not pertinent to the subject and would be out of order. 1876 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. DonLE. We will decide what we think is pertinent and you rely upon the advice of your counsel. We will perform our duty and your counsel will perform his. So let's proceed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you answer the question, please ?
Mrs. WszHEDIN. What was the question, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a native of California?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. NO. 
Mr.TAENNER. Where wereyou born?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. This question, sir, I hesitate to answer in light of some of the previousMr. DOYLE. I instruct you to answer. We are not satisfied with your answer and you know we would not be. I direct you to answer the question.
Mrs. WHEEDIN. I will be glad to answer if I am not told to go back where I came from as some of the previous witnesses were.
Mr. DOYLE. This committee has no jurisdiction to tell you where to go. We have never done it. Now please don't be facetious. Just proceed in a dignified manner.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I was born in Suchow, China.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you come to this country ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I don't recall exactly, sir, I was a few months of aMr. TAVENNER. Are you a naturalized American citizen ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. No, I am a citizen by birth.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I don't quite understand that question. I first came to California, again I don't recall exactly, I was only about 8 years of age at the time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you lived here continuously since then?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. NO. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, then, please tell us what other places it was where you lived.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. That is a rather involved question. Do you want me to go into all the places I have been ?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO. Let us begin with 1945 and tell us where you have lived since that time. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Well, sir, I hardly see that this is pertinent and if it is pertinent then it behooves me to resort to the first and fifth amendments and decline to answer your question.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that the witness be directed to answer.
Mr. DOYLE. We believe it is a pertinent and proper question and I instruct you to answer. (The witness conferred with her counsel.) 
Mrs. WHEELDIN. You said since 1945; is that correct?
Mr. TAVENNER. I will change the question and make it 1944.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I have lived in California since 1944.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where in California?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. In Los Angeles County.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you reside in Los Angeles now ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. No, I do not, sir. Do you mean county or city
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, where do you reside.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. At the present time I live in Pasadena.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived there ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1877 
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I have to stop and think a minute. I would say roughly speaking around 10 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I am a housewife, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any business or occupation in which you are engaged other than that of being a housewife ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I have a profession. However, I am, at present I have no work, I have no job at all, I am a housewife.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. By profession I am a social worker.
Mr. TAVENNER. When were you last engaged in the practice of that profession?
Mrs. WHEELMIN. Sir, if this question is pertinent, and I doubt that it is, I would like to ask for direction of the committee as to whether or not the question is pertinent, I don'tMr. DOYLE. Our distinguished counsel asked you a question and he doesn't waste his time or your time in asking any questions that are not pertinent. We are not satisfied with your answer. You didn't answer it. I direct you to answer it.
Mrs. WHEELDIN.' Well, sir, on the basis of my rights as very definitely established in the first amendment guaranteeing me the right of free speech, free association, and the right I have not to inquire into my private affairs and also upon the fifth amendment, which I do take at this time also in view of the nature of the whole nature of this type of inquiry that you have been conducting here, which corresponds to the inquisition during the 1700's-Mr. DYLE. You have a right to stand on your constitutional privilege. We always admire a person who does it honestly, in good faith, but I am not going to allow you to take this forum to make a speech.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I have stated my reasons for refusing to answer the questions, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you plead the constitutional privileges?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I think I made that clear.
Mr. DoYLE. I didn't think you made it quite clear enough for the record. If you will claim your constitutional privilegeMrs. WHEELDIN. I have done so, the first and the fifth amendments.
Mr. DOYLE. You stand upon those?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Yes, I do.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you active in PTA work in Pasadena?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Again I question the pertinency of such questions.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I ask a direction of the witness?
Mr. DOYLE. We are instructed by Congress to investigate Communist Party activity wherever it is, whether it is in the schools or labor or anything, any group. We believe therefore it is pertinent. I instruct you to answer the question. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. WHEELDIN. I don't quite understand what you mean by active.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the PTA? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Yes, I am a member of the PTA.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you take active part in its work?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I still don't understand what you mean by active. Do you mean am I an officer or what? 1878 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to know what your activity is in the PTA. You know better than I do.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I am a member and that is about the extent of it.
Mr. SCHERER. Witness, aren't you very active, in fact, so active that 3our picture has appeared in magazines in connection with your activity in schoolwork and PTA work and in controversies arising over school matters? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Mr. Scherer, you seem to know more about that than I do.
Mr. SCHERER. Will you answer the question ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. What is the question?
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Tavenner asked you whether you were active in PTA work and you didn't seem to knowMrs. WHEELDIN. I have answered the question.
Mr. SCHERER. You asked me a question and I want to explain my question. Mr. Tavenner asked you whether or not you were active in the PTA work. You have fenced with him and dodged the question and said you didn't know what "active" meant, you were merely a member. Now I am calling your attention to information that has come to me and asking you isn't it a fact that you were active to such an extent that I believe it was Life magazine that carried your picture showing your activities in connection with PTA and schoolwork. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Well, sir, I have belonged to the PTA for many years, ever since I had children in the school system because I feel this is an important part of my responsibility as a parent and if you refer to a picture that appeared in Life, yes, I saw it, too.
Mr. SCHERER. That is all.
Mr. TAVENNER. That of course was based on your activity in the PTA, was it not?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I would hardly say so.
Mr. SCHERER. What was it based on?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I don't know what you have reference to, what was it based on. It is a very ambiguous question.
Mr. SCHERER. Well, it was based on a controversy, then, in an educational matter in Pasadena, was it not? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Any furtherMr. SCHERER. I asked you a question.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I thought he was speaking.
Mr. SCHERER. He was talking to my colleague. Will you read the question to the witness? (The reporter read from his notes as requested.)
Mr. SCIERER. That is the question. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Well, sir, it sounds like a rather opinionated question. It calls for stating my opinion and I have no opinion on it. I think the story in the magazine itself tells you what you might want to know.
Mr. SCHERER. What was it based on then ? You tell us.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. What was what based on?
Mr. SCHERER. You just admitted that your picture appeared in Life magazine and I asked you if it didn't appear in connection with a COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1879 controversy in the educational system of Pasadena. Or did it appear in connection with some other activity or event. That question is clear. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I see what you mean. Well, this was around Pasadena schools, yes.
Mr. SCHERER. That is all I want to know.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your name prior to your marriage?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. My maiden name, sir ?
Mr. TAVENNER, Yes.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Snell.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever been known by the name of Martha Hard?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. It is my name, sir, I was married previously.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was your name Martha Hard during the period of 1945 to 1948? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer on the basis of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witnessMr. DOYLE. We cannot accept your answer and I direct you to answer the question.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer on the basis of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you in the hearing room yesterday during the a functionary meetperiod of time that Mr. Wereb testified regarding ing of the Communist Party at which he named those functionaries who were present? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. DoYLE. The witness volunteered the statement she had been in the hearing room all week.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I was here yesterday, if that is what you mean.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. Did you hear Mr. Wereb identify you as a functionary of the Communist Party who attended a functionary meeting attended by him? and
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer on the basis of the first fifth amendments. because
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer Wereb's tesMr. Tavenner only asked if she heard that part of Mr. tMr DOYLE. We do not accept your answer, Madam Witness, and I direct you to answer.
Mr. SCHERER. Couldn't possibly incriminate her. truly can't trust
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Yes, in a whole day's testimony I If you want to have my recollection of everything the witness said. the record retaped or rereadMr. DOYLE. Not even about yourself. You couldn't trust your memory as to that? I ask you that. (The witness conferred with her counsel.) as to that.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I can't even trust my recollection
Mr. DOYLE. As to yourself, what you heard him say?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I stand on what I have said. you
Mr. DOLE. You understand the question is whether or not heard him; heard what he said? 1880 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I heard some of the things he said.
Mr. DOYLE. About you.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I do not recall all of the things he said.
Mr. DOYLE. About you? I notice you were close by him when he was testifying. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. May I pursue it? 
Mr. DoYLE. Yes, indeed.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I recall him having said the name Martha Hard, but I have no basis for knowing that is the same person as me. There are other persons by such name.
Mr. TAVENNER. To be certain about this, were you a member of the Hawthorne group of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer on the basis of the first and fifth amendments. I do not feel that you can call me to answer such a question in the light of the type of inquiry you have been conducting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of any group of the Communist Party other than the Hawthorne group ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Again I decline on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. You indicated some uncertainty as to the testimony of Mr. Wereb relating to Martha Hard. His testimony was that Martha Hard, a functionary of the Communist Party, attended a functionaries' meeting which he also attended. Were you a functionary of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer your question, sir, for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. To your knowledge, did you attend any Communist Party meeting which was also attended by Mr. Wereb ?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Again, sir, I decline to answer. As I told you when I made my original statement in the interest of saving time there would be no need of asking me questions on any of this area because I decline to answer them on the basis of the first and the fifth amendments, which I am sure you are as well aware of their meaning as I am.
Mr. SOHERER. Will you look around, Witness, and look at the gentleman standing there-stand up-look at the gentleman(The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. Do you know that gentleman? (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I refuse to answer such a question on the basis of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. SCUERER. Mr. Tavenner just told you what he said when he was on the stand the other day. Was that testimony about you true
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Sir, I decline to answer on the reasons previously stated, and again I say in the interest of saving time there is really no point in asking me such questions, because I will continue to decline to answer.
Mr. DOYLE. I wish to answer you, Madam, you needn't worry about saving our time. We have plenty of time.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I have time. Time is valuable to me, too. My housework and children have been neglected this week.
Mr. T.VENNER. Were you given any Communist Party assignment in Pasadena?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer that question, sir, on the grounds previously stated. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 1881 
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Generally I decline to answer on the grounds of the first and the fifth amendments and I do not feel that anybody has a right to ask such a question.
Mr. DOYLE. Of course under Public Law 601 we are delegated by your Congress, your United States Congress, to ask that very question in the field of subversive activities of the Communist Party or any other subversive group. (The witness conferred with her counsel.)
Mr. DOYLE. We are on an investigation of subversive activities. We know of no Supreme Court decision which stops us from investigating in any field in which we can legislate and clearly the United States Congress has and no doubt will further legislate in the field of subversive activities. So when we ask you about Communist Party activities, it is an illegal party, it is a subversive outfit, has been so declared and recognized, we believe it pertinent.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. Sir, your investigation may well be in order as long as it does not violate my constitutional rights. The Constitution has been in effect in this country for many years and I trust will continue for many years.
Mr. DOYLE. That is right. We are certainly in agreement on that and of course the Communist Party is known to us as an outfit, a gang, a conspiracy that would forcibly overthrow that form of constitutional government. I think you know that, you may know it.
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I am not anxious to get into an argument with you about the Constitution or anything else.
Mr. DOYLE. I know that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been a member of the Communist Party at any time
Mrs. WHEELDIN. I decline to answer that question on the same ground as previously stated. It is the same question.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. No reflection is to be made upon the Parent-Teachers Association as a result of questions asked. It is not the purpose of the committee to investigate the Parent-Teachers Association, which is one of the most important, effective, and finest influential organizations in this country. I want to make that clear. Your membership and activity in that organization certainly should not be criticized, you should be commended for any Parent-Teachers Association work that you have performed. I make that statement to clarify that it is not our purpose to investigate the Parent-Teachers Association.
Mr. SCHERER. I agree with what Mr. Moulder says about PTA, but of course we are interested in determining whether or not Communists belong or are active in any organization whether it be PTA, labor union, fraternal organization, or what. That is the purpose of the questions.
Mr. MOULDER. I want to make our position clear. I don't know whether there is any testimony as to whether in the interests of the Communists she was a member of the Parent Teachers Association. That is my point.
Mr. DOYE. I am glad you made that statement, Mr. Moulder. I concur in it. As a matter of fact, I used to be president of a PTA. 1882 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. ScnERE. I am a member now.
Mr. DOLE. You are a member now
Mr. SCHERER. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. There is nothing wrong with the PTA.
Mr. DOLE. Let's congratulate the PTA on having a member like you, Mr. Scherer.
Mr. Scan e. Thank you.
Mr. DOYLE. I want to congratulate the PTA on the great work they have done and always do, but that doesn't stop us as a congressional committee from trying to find out the extent to which the Communist conspiracy even tries to infiltrate the PTA and other groups. That is our job and we would hope that this witness might try to help us. Any other questions?
Mr. MOULDER. I understand that. I wanted to clarify the point that we are not investigating the Parent-Teachers Association here or anywhere else.
Mr. DOYE. That is right. We are investigating individuals. Any question?
Mr. MOULDER. We could ask the question as to whether or not she has ever held any official position in that Parent Teachers Association?
Mr. DOLE. We did ask that.
Mr. MOULDER. YOU just asked about the extent of her activities but every parent who is a member will be active to some extent. I don't know to what extent she was active.
Mr. DOYLE. Any questions, Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. I have no questions.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you, Madam Witness, and Counsel You are excused. (Whereupon the witness was excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Louis Stark.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. STARK. I do. TESTIMONY OF LOUIS STARK, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, ROBERT KENNY
