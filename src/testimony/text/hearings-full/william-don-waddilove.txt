Mr. WADDILOVE. W-a-d-d-i-l-o-v-e. (Representative Donald L. Jackson left from the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Waddilove, it is noted that you are not accompanied by counsel.
Mr. WADDILOVE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is the practice of the committee to advise all witnesses that they are entitled to counsel if they so desire, and to confer with counsel at any time during their testimony if the witness feels the occasion requires it. When and where you born, Mr. Waddilove?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Ridgeway, Mo., May 4, 1919.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your educational training has been.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Secondary school and 1 year at the University of
Missouri.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession or occupation ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I am a musician.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you practice your profession in Los Angeles between 1947 and 1949 ?
Mr. WADDOVE. I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you engaged in that type of work in Los Angeles?
Mr. WADDILOVE. From 1942 until 1952.
Mr. TAVENNER. During that period of time did you reside in the general area of Los Angeles?
Mr. WADDILOE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, whether or not you were a member of the Communist Party at any time during that period?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I was. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Specifically, during what period of time were you a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDLOVE. The latter half of 1947 and all of 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. Does that mean you left the Communist Party early in 1949 ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, the circumstances under which you became a member of the Communist Party? (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. WADDILOVE. Early in 1947 I was engaged in a business venture which was on the verge of failing, and eventually did. About-I am estimating-April or May of 1947, I was engaged in a discussion group with several people for the purpose of discussing political issues and economic issues in general on a social basis. At first only general issues were discussed. And this went on for some time, and finally the people revealed themselves as Communists, after a while, after we agreed on the solution of certain issues, and we were told that these issues could only be resolved through working through the Communist Party. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3661 And that roughly are the circumstances surrounding my becoming a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. If I have understood you correctly, you were engaged in discussion groups with several people regarding political and economic issues ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct. 
Mr. MOULDER. The committee will recess for 5 minutes. (Whereupon, a short recess was taken, Representatives Moulder, Doyle, Jackson, and Scherer being present.) (At the expiration of the recess, the committee was reconvened, Representatives Moulder, Doyle, and Scherer being present.)
Mr. MOULDER. The committee will be in order. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Waddilove, I understood from your testimony that you had occasion to meet from time to time with a group of people who discussed political and economic issues.
Mr. WADDILovE. Correct. 
Mr. TAvENER. And that finally during those discussions several persons made themselves known to you as members of the Communist Party; is that correct?
Mr. WADDILOE. That is correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. And you were advised by them that the only solution to the issues which you had been discussing was through the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. That is correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were those individuals identifying themselves to you as members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Henry Roth and Sam Albert. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Henry Roth, R-o-t-h. And what was the name of the other person?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Sam Albert. Were those individuals musicians? (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. You knew them at that time as being musiciansI
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did they seek your membership in the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I mean by that, did they ask you to join 
Mr. WADDILOVE. Not in so many words, but it was the whole point of the discussion group.
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of what occurred and what you have just described, did you become a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I did. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Upon joining were you assigned to a group or unit of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. They were all musicians. 
Mr. MOULDER. May I ask one question, Mr. Tavenner? You say you became a member of the Communist Party. What do you mean? How did you become a member of the Communist Party? 3662 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WADDILOVE. By the members revealing themselves to me and being asked or permitted to attend party meetings.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you pay dues?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Nominal dues, as I recall.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you issued any identification?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No. 
Mr. JACKSON. As a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No. 
Mr. TAVENNER. How many persons composed the group of the Communist Party with which you affiliated, as nearly as you can now recall? This was in 1947, I believe.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct. I don't know the exact number, but I heard that there were roughly maybe 70 or 75 at one time.
Mr. MOULDER. At the Communist Party meetings?
Mr. TAVEXXER. No. He said members of the group. He didn't describe any particular meeting.
Mr. SCHERER. Membership.
Mr. MOULDER. How did you know there were that many ?
Mr. WADDLOVE. Well, the figure was mentioned.
Mr. MOULDER. That is the reason I asked the question. Was it as a result of attending meetings or by examination of some records?
Mr. WADDILOVE. By hearsay.
Mr. TAVENNER. After you became a member of this group, were meetings regularly held or at any stated intervals?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Weekly meetings were scheduled.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently were they held, generally ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Weekly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend the meetings?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Many of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend meetings during the entire period of your membership ?
Mr VWADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall how many persons normally attended these meetings?
Mr. WADDILOVE. At one time, maybe 10 or 12.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were the meetings held?
Mr. WADDILovE. Various homes, including my own. AMr. TAVENNER. Can you recall the names of any persons in whose homes these meetings were held?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like you to give the committee that information, please.
Mr. WADDILOVE. The home of Anita Short.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell that last name ?
Mr. WADDILOvE. S-h-o-r-t.
Mr. TAVENNER. Short, Anita Short.
Mr. WADDILOVE. George Sandell.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell it, please.
Mr. WADDILOVE. I believe it is S-a-n-d-e-l or two l's. I amnot clear. Cyril Towbin.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS the correct spelling T-o-w-b-i-n or T-o-b-i-n? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3663 
Mr. WADDILOVE. I am not sure. As I recall, there was possibly a meeting at the house of Joe Pass, Sam Fordis. That is, as I recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that last name? I didn't understand.
Mr. WaDDILOVE. Fordis.
Mr. TAVENNER Will you spell it, please.
Mr. WADDILOVE. I think it is F-o-r-d-i-s.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the character of the meetings held in those homes and other homes?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Mainly they were study groups.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend meetings of this group of the Communist Party in homes other than those that you have mentioned?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. I can't recall exactly just whose, but there were more.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, the chief activity of this group of the Communist Party? In other words, during your affiliation with this group, what appeared to be its main objective?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Its main objective during that period was implementing the third party or the Independent Progressive Party, getting it on the ballot in California.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was this matter discussed in those meetings of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Quite fully.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there occasions when Communist Party functionaries came to your meeting? That is functionaries on a higher level, and told your membership what it was supposed to do?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. The IPP was the target for 1948. All work was channeled in that direction.
Mr. MOULDER. The IPP. That is the Independent Progressive Party is it not?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall at this time the names of any of the Communist Party functionaries who attended the meetings of your group?
Mr. WADDILOVE. The only one I could possibly recall would be Frank Spector. That is the only one I was aware of.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know what position he held in the Communist Party at that time?
Mr. WADDILOE. No; I don't, not exactly.
Mr. TAVENNER. He was not a member of your group of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall what your group was advised or told to do?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Well, we circulated petitions, securing signatures. That was signatures to get the Independent Progressive Party on the California ballot. And after this was done, why, then we did what we could to promote the Independent Progressive Party, and, in addition, were requested to change our own registration from whatever it was to IPP or Independent Progressive Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you follow the directions you received from the Communist Party in both of those particulars? That is, in changing your registration and also in circulating petitions? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 2664 
Mr. WADDILOVE. I did both.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of an affidavit of registration showing your registration as an affiliate of the Independent Party, as it is stated here, under date of February 23, 1948. I have another photostatic copy of an affidavit of registration indicating a change of residence, with registration under the name of the Independent Progressive Party of California, bearing date April 21, 1948. Will you examine these documents and state whether you recognize them as copies of your registrations? [Documents handed to the witness.]
Mr. WADDILOVE. I would accept it as that.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer both documents in evidence and ask that they be marked "Waddilove Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2", respectively.

Mr. WADDILOVE. It says Deputy Registrar of Voters. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know her as a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Our investigation has disclosed a petition which shows, at the end of it, a statement that you were the one who circulated it. I hand you a three-page photostatic copy of it and ask you to examine it and state what it is, please. 3666 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WADDILOVE. This is one I circulated in an effort to get the Independent Progressive Party on the ballot in the State of California in 1948.
Mr. TAvENNER. I believe it is dated January 16, 1948.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document referred to above in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Waddilove Exhibit No. 3."
Mr. MOULDER. The document so offered by counsel is admitted in evidence. (See p. 3667.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Did other members of the Communist Party group engage in the same type of activities which you described you pursued?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I believe we all did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you, on your level in the Communist Party, advised why the Communist Party was taking such an active part in getting the Independent Progressive Party on the ballot in California?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I am not quite sure I know exactly what you mean. However, from an organizational standpoint, I suppose it was logical because of the organization already set up.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you ever told that the Independent Progressive Party offered the best vehicle for the advancement of the program of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No, not as such.
Mr. SCHERER. What did you understand to be the purpose of the Communist Party in infiltrating the Progressive Party? Why was it done?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I would say, rather than infiltrate, I think it was spearheaded by the Communist Party. I don't think the Progressive Party would have reached a place on the ballot had it not been for the organization of the Communist Party behind it.
Mr. SCHERER. Why did the Communist Party spearhead it?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I am not so certainMr. SCHERER. Did the Communist Party feel that it had more chance of success by using the name Progressive Party rather than Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Undoubtedly.
Mr. SCHERER. Was that the reason ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I would say that is a good reason.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. You mentioned the name of Frank Spector as a Communist who attended some of your meetings and discussed activities relating to the Independent Progressive Party. Do you know what position, if any, he held in the Independent Progressive Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No; I do not. 
Mr. DOYLE. A moment ago you said that one of the reasons, in your judgment, that the Communist Party was spearheading the circulation of these petitions to qualify the Independent Progressive Party and to make it a legal party in the State of California, was because you felt the party had more chance of success through the Independent Progressive Party. Do you remember stating that substantially ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 3667 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA WADDILOVE EXHIBIT NO. 3 IPPC 6425 INDEPENDENT PROGRESSIVE PARTY OF CALIFORNIA PETITION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION JUNE 1, 1948 LOS ANGELES CialItd fl the County(or CityandCounty)of STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOS _ _ ANGEL County or City snd Co.uty)of TO THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF STATEOF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA: We. the underlgn. inhterd.

Mr. Do L. Do I understand by that, in your judgment, that the Communist Party, of which you were a member and for which you were circulating the petition to qualify the Independent Progressive Party, was therefore considering the Independent Progressive Party as a front for the Communist Party? Did it go to that extent in your judgment? Is that why you were doing it.
Mr. WADDILOVE. In actuality that is what it was. 
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. MOULDER. In order to clarify the record, and probably give you an opportunity to explain your testimony in that respect: Do you mean to infer that all people who signed or whose signatures were secured on the petition to place the Independent Progressive Party on the ballot as a legal party, were Communists?
Mr. WADDILOVE. By no means, by no means.
Mr. TAVENNER. After becoming a member of this group of the Communist Party did you discover that the two persons, whose names you first gave us, were members of the same group ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What were their names?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Henry Roth and Sam Albert. 
Mr. TAVENNER. You have been asked to list as many of the members of your group of the Communist Party as you could recall. Have you done that?
Mr WADDILOVE. Yes, I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have given us the names of those two persons- Roth and Albert-and the names of a number of persons in whose homes this group of the Communist Party met. Now will you give us the names, please, of all of the other persons that you can recall who were known to you to be members of that same group of the Communist Party of which you were a member?
Mr. WADDILOE. Joe Eger. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Due to the difficulty of hearing, I am going to ask you to spell that last name. I couldn't hear it pronounced. 
Mr. WADDILOVE. Eger. I believe it is E-g-e-r.
Mr. JACKSON. I believe the name should be spelled against any possible error in identification.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. And you could hear that, Mr. Witness?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. Spell the names in all instances.
Mr. TAVANNER. Give us the name again, please.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Joe Eger.
Mr. TAVENNEE. Proceed.
Mr. WADDILOE. Victor Gottlieb.
Mr. JACKSON. Spell the name, please.
Mr. WADDILOVE. I believe it is G-o-t-t-l-i-e-b. Some of these spellings I don't know. I know the names, but I am not sure of the spelling.
Mr. JAcKsoN. There is no question as to your knowledge of an individual as a member of the Communist Party, although you may not have the precise spelling of the name?
Mr. WADDILOVE. That is right. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3669 
Mr. MOULDER. May I ask, Mr. Tavenner, does the staff investigation reveal the correct spelling of the names of the persons the witness is identifying
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; it does.
Mr. MOULDER. May I suggest, Mr. Tavenner, that you request the spelling of the name if there is any question about it, and also that you identify the person as carefully as possible so that the person named will not be confused with some other person who might have the same name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me ask you again, Were all of these individuals whose names you are now giving us musicians?
Mr. WADDILOV . Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. So that would identify them by occupation. If there is any other identifying information you can furnish regarding the individual, I wish you would do so as you give the name. According to the committee's investigation, the spelling of Gottlieb that you gave is the correct spelling.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Morris Browda. I believe it is B-r-o-w-d-a.
Mr. TAVENER. The first name is what?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Morris.
Mr. TAVENNER. How do you spell Morris? MI. W.DDILOVE. M-o-r-r-i-s. Herb Offener, O-f-f-n-e-r, I believe. Wayne Ronka. I have it R-o-n-k-a.
Mr. TAVENNER. And the first name. Wayne?
Mr. WADDILOVE. W-a-y-n-e. Milt Kestenbaum. I have K-e-s-t-e-n-b-a-u-m.
Mr. TAVENNER. TWhat is the first name?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Milt. SMr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether Milt is an abbreviation for Milton ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. Rubin Decker, D-e-c-k-e-r.
Mr. TAVENNE. What is the spelling of the first name?
Mr. WADDILOVE. R-u-b-i-n, I believe. Herb Lessner. Herbert, I guess. L-e-s-s-n-e-r.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the first name?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Herb. George Kast, K-a-s-t. That is about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with a musician by the name of Paul Powell?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Oh, yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. P-o-w-e-1-1?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now our investigation discloses that there are 2 musicians by the name of Paul Powell, 1 living in Oregon, and the other in Los Angeles. Which Paul Powell is it to whom you refer?
Mr. WVADDILOVE. It is probably the one that lives in Los Angeles at the moment.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, as far as I know, he has not identified either one of these persons as members of the Communist Party. 3670 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. All of these persons were members. He is now identifying persons who were known to him to be members of the Communist Party in his professional group. I think, for clarity of the record, we should state at this time that as far as the committee knows, the Paul Powell in Oregon is not the one who is a member of the Communist Party; the committee has no knowledge of the Paul Powell in Oregon as having been a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. MOULDER. May I ask to what period of time you are referring when you say that some person is a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. WADDILOVE. I am referring to nothing later than the first or early part of 1949. I would have no knowledge past that point.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you mean since that time? Since 1949 ?
Mr. WADDLOVE. That is correct. 
Mr. MOULDER. Are you identifying those persons as of that year ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. As of that year.
Mr. MOULDER. Can you give us specific information as to why you know they were at that time members of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I attended meetings with them. 
Mr. MOULDER. Can you give more specific information as to what the meetings were? Were they Communist Party meetings?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Were they closed meetings of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. Confined strictly to Communist Party members?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with a person by the name of Seymour Sheklow?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of your group of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. He was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend Communist Party meetings with him?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. The spelling of that name is S-e-y-m-o-u-r. The last name is S-h-e-k-l-o-w. Are you acquainted with a person by the name of Sidney Greene?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. The spelling is S-i-d-n-e-y G-r-e-e-n-e?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Sidney Greene known to you to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. And a member of your group of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do I understand that you attended Communist Party meetings with all of these individuals whose names you have given us?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, whether or not it was the practice in this group of the Communist Party, with which COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3671 you were affiliated, to study Communist Party doctrine and philosophy? 
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. And literature ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was that carried out? How was that instruction given?
Mr. WADDILOE. From week to week a new topic would be chosen, and the discussion would be held the following week of the material -covered.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was the membership furnished with books and other materials on the subjects which you discussed?
Mr. WADDILOVE. They were available. We paid for them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were those books made available to the membership at the meetings which you have described ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What proportion of the meetings was usually devoted to the study of Communist Party doctrine and principles?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Anywhere from one-half to one-third possibly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that fairly constant during your entire membership from 1947 to the beginning of 1949 ?
Mr. WADLILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know why the membership of your group of the Communist Party was composed solely of musicians?
Mr. WADDILVE. Well, I think that it was probably set up on a trade basis.
Mr. TAVENNER. I suppose it was required that all of these musicians be members of a union in order to work in their occupation?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Basically, yes; to be gainfully employed, yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. During the period of your membership in 1947 and 1948, did your Communist Party group endeavor to interest itself in the election of any particular slate in your union, to act as a unit in doing that?
Mr. WADDILOVE. We sponsored a slate. I believe it was in 1948.
Mr. MOULDER. You say "we sponsored a slate"?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you say "we" to whom are you referring?
Mr. WADDmOVE. The Communist Party at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did the Communist Party, in your opinion, succeed in any substantial way to control any of the offices of your local union ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No. 
Mr. SCHERER. Was the slate you sponsored comprised of members of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. NO. It was people who they thought could, by virtue of their popularity, win the election.
Mr. SCHERER. They weren't necessarily members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. It was an antiadministration slate rather than proanything.
Mr. SCHERER. I didn't get that.
Mr. WADDILOVE. You understand what I mean?
Mr. SCHERER. Antiadministration? Anti union administration slate? 3672 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. SCHERER. And they supported the antiadministration faction?
Mr. WADDILOVE. The antiadministration faction; yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. So, regardless in what activities your group of the Communist Party engaged, it was not successful within your local union?
Mr. WADDILoVE. No.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman ?
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. Did I understand from your testimony the fact to be then, that the Communist Party cell, the members of which were also members of the musicians' union, put up a slate which was antiunion ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Not antiunion; no. In other words, it was in opposition to the incumbents. It was not successful.
Mr. DOYLE. Did the Communist Party cell caucus on the slate as to who they would put up ?
Mr. WADDILovE. Not as a cell, I don't believe.
Mr. DOYLE. Was there any endeavor on the part of your Communist Party cell, as a cell, to shape the policies of the union ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. It probably had quite a bit to do with the platform.
Mr. DOYLE. It probably had a good deal to do with the platform?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. To understand my question, let me ask it this way: Did the Communist Party cell of which you were a member, within the union, undertake to act in concert and influence the platform of the union as a Communist Party cell, that is, acting as a unit?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Not per se. I mean the whole opposition, again as in the case of the Independent Progressive Party, was not all Communist. It was more or less guided by them, or spearheaded, if you wish, but not in toto.
Mr. DOYLE. I don't quite hear. More or less guided by the Communist Party cell policy. Is that it?
Mr. WADDILOVE. In cooperation with the other people in the same slate.
Mr. DoYLE. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understood you to say that you left the Communist Party at the end of 1948 or very early in 1949.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Correct. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your reason for leaving the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I had several reasons. The failure of the Independent Progressive Party in 1948 made me see, or led me to believe, that the majority of the American people had rejected it and, therefore, it was not the right thing to do. And also I was raised in a very religious household.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you raise your voice please? 
Mr. WADDILOVE. It is hard to throw off a religious background and, sooner or later, it crops up, according to the vernacular, and you have to live with it. The main reason: my main disagreement with the party was objectingMr. TAVENNER. The reporter is having difficulty hearing you. Would you repeat that, please. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3673 
Mr. WADDILOVE. If I can. 
Mr. TAVENNER. You were speaking of your religious background. 
Mr. WADDILOVE. The Communist Party chooses to ignore God in the scheme of things. I don't say they deny God, but they choose to ignore it in the scheme of human events. And that was a basic disagreement as far as I was concerned. And, thirdly, it isn't pleasant to work, what you might say, underground for any length of time. I mean I like to be able to look people in the eye once in a while. And I was tired of being a fugitive from the human race.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you rebelled at the secret methods used by the Communist Party, as one point?
Mr. WADDILOVE. It finally got to be quite a task; yes. 
Mr. DoLE. Do I understand that you, as a member of the Communist Party in Los Angeles, in 1947,1948 and 1949-I wish to specify not as a union man-were finding yourself obligated to work in secret and underground? You just used the word "underground."
Mr. WADDILOVE. Well, it was and is very, very unpopular, and you just-I don't know how else to put it, frankly.
Mr. DOYLE. You can't describe it any other way than "underground," if that is what you were required to do. That is where rats and mice hide generally.
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of your reaction to those matters, what did you do?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I dropped out of the party. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you give any notice of any kind of your contemplated action?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. You just quit?
Mr. WADDILovE. I just dropped out; quit. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was any effort made at any later period to get you back into the Communist Party? 
Mr. WADDILOVE. Nothing very serious; no.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you severed all connections with the Com- munist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Absolutely. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Was the action that you took in 1949 final and complete ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Absolutely. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you knowledge of Communist Party activities on the part of any of the members of your group since the time you withdrew?
Mr. WADDILOVE. None whatsoever. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Doyle, any questions?
Mr. DOYLE. May I inquire on a few points? I think, Mr. Chairman, my recollection is that in connection with the circulation of petitions, by the Communist Party and others possibly, in Los Angeles County to qualify the Independent Progressive Party as a legal party in my State, there were some 11,000 signatures on the IPP petitions in Los Angeles County. Did you as one of the circulators, as a Communist, tell any of the people who signed the petition for you that you were a Communist and that your Comminist cell was circulating this petition? 3674 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WADDILOVE. No. 
Mr. DOYLE. Why not? Why didn't you reveal that it was the Communist Party that was circulating the IPP petition ?
Mr. WADDILOVE. That isn't the way it worked. In other words, we were doing it apparently as private citizens.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, the Communist Party was doing it secretly and as an underground operation. Is that correct?
Mr. WADDILOVE. In essence. 
Mr. DOYE. I think, Mr. Chairman, the record will show that in former hearings in California we have an abundance of testimony under oath by former leaders in the IPP in California who were also top leaders in the Communist Party in California that the Communist Party in California not only circulated these petitions, but they dictated the leadership of the IPP in many, many cases in California during that campaign. I am sure the record will reveal that fact in our previous hearings. I wish to thank the witness.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, I have here a communication allegedly signed by some 22 people who indicate that they are members of Local 47, American Federation of Musicians. I want to ask the witness if he has seen this letter. It constitutes a protest against the hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. (Document handed to the witness.)
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes; I saw a copy of it. Mir. JACKSON. Did you read it?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No.
Mr. JACKSON. It is very difficult for me to believe that this letter, signed by 22 members, constitutes an expression of what I understand is a union membership of 15,000 musicians in this area. I should like to ask the witness after he reads the letter if he feels, from his own association within the musician's organization, that the letter constitutes a majority opinion?
Mr. WADDILOVE. I would say no.
Mr. JACKSON. Since you received your subpena to appear before the committee, have you been approached by any person, other than investigators for this committee, relative to your appearance?
Mr. WADDILOVE. No.
Mr. JACKSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Scherer?
Mr. SCHERER. I have no questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Waddilove, I have 1 or 2 questions to ask you. First, as to the name of the Communist Party group that you belonged to: What was its name, if it had a name or designation as a group? You have referred to it as a Communist Party group, and I assume that it had some identification other than just a Communist Party group.
Mr. WADDILOVE. I think it was called the Steinmetz Club.
Mr. MOULDER. What?
Mr. TADDILOVE. Steinmetz, as I recall it.
Mr. MOULDER. And, also, according to your information-and I believe you referred to it as hearsay information-that the total membership totaled approximately 70 or 75. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3675 
Mr. WADDILOVE. That is what I heard; yes.
Mr. MOULDER. You understood that?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. MOULDER. Of that number, how many have you identified during your testimony as having been members of the Communist Party?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Roughly 20. 
Mr. MOULDER. You have named 20. I believe I recall your testimony that Mrs. Esther Roth was a member of the Communist Party. Was she a musician?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. And also a registrar, or deputy registrar?
Mr. TAVELNER. Deputy registrar of voters.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes. 
Mr. MOULDER. On what do you base your opinion about her being a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. W~ADDILOVE. She attended meetings of our group.
Mr. MOULDER. Participated in Communist Party meetings?
Mr. VWADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. As referred to by Mr. Jackson, closed Communist Party meetings
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. As I understand your testimony no other person could attend those meetings, unless he was a bona fide member of the Communist Party at that time. Is that correct?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. As stated by Mr. Jackson, anyone can become a deputy registrar. It has no official significance other than that every citizen has authority to take a form and have someone else sign it and refer to themselves as being a deputy registrar.
Mr. WADDILOVE. Right.
Mr. MOULDER. Then Mrs. Roth was a musician, instead of a public official. Is that correct?
Mr. WADDILOVE. Oh, yes. 
Mr. MOULDER. That is what I understand. On behalf of the committee, Mr. Waddilove, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for your sincere and honest cooperation with this committee in giving your testimony. You are excused as a witness, and you may claim your witness fees from the deputy clerk who sits just behind you. The committee will stand in recess for a period of 5 minutes. (Whereupon, a short recess was taken, Representatives Moulder, Doyle, Jackson, and Scherer being present.) (At the expiration of the recess the committee was reconvened, Representatives Moulder, Doyle, and Scherer being present.)
Mr. MOULDER. The hearing will be in order, please. All conversation will cease. Are you ready to proceed with another witness, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVNNER. Yes, sir. Edith Rapport, please come forward. (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. My attorney is not with me. I am waiting for my attorney. 3676 COMAMTOIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. MOULDER. The witness will take the witness stand. The committee will come to order, please. Are you Mrs. Fidith Rapport ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; I am.
Mr. MOULDER. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God
Mrs. RAPPORT. I do. 
Mr. MOULDER. The photographers will please be seated. You may proceed, Mr. Tavenner. TESTIMONY OF EDITH RAPPORT (MRS. GEORGE RAPPORT) ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, DANIEL G. MARSHALL
