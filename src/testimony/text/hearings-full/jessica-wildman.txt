Mrs. WILDMAN. My name is Jessica Wildman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel accompanying the witness please identify himself for the record?
Mr. MARGOLIS. Ben Margolis of Los Angeles.
Mr. SCHERER. I didn't get the witness' last name.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Wildman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that your present married name ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your married name prior to your marriage to Mr. Wildman ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. My name was Jessica Rhine.
Mr. TAVENNER. How do you spell Rhine?
Mrs. WILDMAN. R-h-i-n-e.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date of your marriage to Mr. Wildman? 
Mrs. WILDMAN. August 2, 1952.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were you born, Mrs. Wildman ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Chicago, Ill.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now reside ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in Los Angeles ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. For approximately 2 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your formal educational training has been?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes, sir. I am a graduate of the George Mason High School in Alexandria, Va. George Mason was the author of the Bill of Rights as appears in the Constitution of the State of Virginia, and one of the most ardent sponsors of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United States of America.
Mr. TAVENNER. Does that complete your educational training?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Well, I had one more year of school. For one year I attended the art school at the Corcoran National Art Gallery in Washington.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, what your employment has been since 1935 ? COiMMUvNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4007 
Mrs. WILDMAN. Since 1935 I have worked for various agencies of the United States Government, for several organizations and several private business firms.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your first employment in the United States Government?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Well, I am not quite sure whether when I worked for the Civil Works Administration in the city of Washington, D. C., it was part of the Washington, D. C. government or the Federal Government, but that was my first Government employment.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date of that employment?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Either 1932 or 1933, I don't remember which.
Mr. MOULDER. May I suggest to the witness the Civil Works Administration wasn't established until after 1932.
Mrs. WILDMAN. It must have been 1933.
Mr. MoULDER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your next employment?
Mrs. WILDMAN. After that I went to work for the National Recovery Administration.
Mr. TAvENNER. What was the period of your employment there?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I don't know whether I started late in 1933 or early in 1934. In any event, I worked there until January of 1936 or December of 1935.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then did you have other Government employment after December ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes.
Mr. TAvENNER. 1935 or January 1936?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes. I worked following that for the Railroad Retirement Board.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that in the city of Washington ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes, it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you employed by the Railroad Retirement Board ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Well, that is a difficult question, too, because it was one of those on-again off-again things. I went to work first for the Railroad Retirement Board and then for a brief period, although I continued to work for the Railroad Retirement Board on a research project, I happened technically to be on the payroll of the WPA. After that, having acquired civil service status, I returned to the payroll of the Railroad Retirement Board and I remained there until shortly before Pearl Harbor, some time in 1941.
Mr. TAVENNER. All of that employment was in the city of Washington, was it not?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Almost all of it. All except for a very brief period when I worked for the NRA in New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. I meant to say all of your employment while you were on the payroll of the Railroad Retirement Board and the WPA was in the city of Washington ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, during 1941, did you take on new employment?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes, I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that? (The witness confers with her counsel.) 7746-56-pt. 10---8 4008 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I was employed as assistant research director for a labor union.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did that employment continue ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Until 1943.
Mr. TAVENNER. What labor organization was it ? 
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Tavenner and Mr. Chairman, this is the first question that I am going to decline to answer, and I am going to decline this answer for two very simple reasons: First, that if I were to answer it I would be voluntarily surrendering my rights to freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and freedom of association. These rights were fought too hard for by our forefathers for me to voluntarily surrender them just because a big stick is waved at me. Secondly, if I were to answer this question and start down the path laid out by this committee, at its end I would be either a groveling, sniveling conformist or an unspeakable odious informer. I prefer to remain a woman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you direct the witness to answer ?
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mrs. WILDMAN. In addition to the first, let me say, I refuse to answer the question, Mr. Chairman, and in addition to the reasons just set forth I base my refusal on the Bill of Rights in its entirety, including its spirit and its legislative background, and very specifically on the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th amendments.
Mr. SCIHEEER. I think we should state for the record that we do not accept the witness' answer because, obviously, to state what labor union she was employed by cannot any more incriminate her than can her stating what agencies of the Federal Government she was employed by. And therefore it is obvious that she is not invoking the fifth amendment in good faith, because I cannot, for the life of me, possibly see how telling us what labor union she was employed by could incriminate her in any way. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. MoULDER. Do you request that the witness be directed to answer?
Mr. SCHERER. I think you have directed her.
Mr. MOULDER. Mrs. Wildman, concerning any future questions propounded to you by counsel which you wish to decline to answer for the reason stated, would it be agreeable with you to state that you are reasserting the same reason which you have just stated by reference thereto ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes, it would be, Mr. Chairman, provided you know that if I think of additional reasons it is all right if I supplement that answer from time to time.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. You indicated that you had changed your employment in 1943.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your new employment in 1943 ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I went to work as a person responsible for handling War Labor Board cases for another labor union.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you work in that capacity?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Until election day of 1944.
Mr. SCHERER. And what labor union was that that you worked for? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4009 
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Chairman, I decline to answer that question for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question as to what labor union she was employed by.
Mr. MoULDER. The witness is directed to answer.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Having been directed, the answer is the same: that I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. And I restate what I said before, that IMrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Chairman, can I comment on that for a minute?
Mr. Scherer has expressed his opinion, and, to be sure, he is entitled to his opinion. My opinion happens to be otherwise. And I mean, this committee has attempted to smear organizations as well as individuals. And I think Mr. Scherer's opinion is incorrect, and I rely on the grounds I just stated.
Mr. SCHERER. When we do not accept the reasons advanced by a witness for declining to answer, the Supreme Court has directed is to tell the witness, before we can possibly hold him in contempt, that we do not accept the answer, and state our reasons for not accepting the answer. I am therefore complying strictly with the recent decision of the Supreme Court directing us to make such a statement, because I feel in this case the witness has subjected herself for contempt and I must, in accordance with that decision, lay the basis for the motion that I will make later asking that she be cited for contempt.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask if the Supreme Court has directed the members of this committee to threaten and intimidate witnesses?
Mr. MOULDER. YOU are not being intimidated.
Mrs. WILDMAN. I certainly am being threatened.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Scherer has made a statement which he has in accordance with the decision of the court. It is our duty to advise you, to warn you of the dangers involved in the event you are in contempt of the committee. Therefore, this committee has had to notify you that your failure to answer the question might make you subject to contempt. Is that correct, Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCHERER. No question about it. 
Mr. MOULDER. It is not for the purpose of intimidation nor is it in the nature of a threat.
Mr. ScHERER. It is a mandate clearly set forth in the Quinn and Emspak cases which these people have been citing. I am trying to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. I don't agree with many of the provisions in those decisions, but nevertheless, I realize that as long as it is a decision of the Supreme Court I must and I will follow it.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner. 
Mr. TAVENNER. During the period of time between 1943 and 1944 when you say you represented a labor union in the handling of labor cases, did your work require you to be in contact with members of the National Labor Relations Board? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. No, it didn't. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did your work require you to be in contact with the National Labor Relations Board?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Oh, certainly. 4010 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. In the city of Washington?
Mrs. WILDMAN. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where? 
Mrs. WILDMAN.
Mr. TAVENNER. Denver?
Mrs. WILDMAN.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the city of Philadelphia. Were you located during any period of that time in During which period of time? 1943 to 1944. 
Mrs. WILDMAN. No. 
Mr.TAVENNER. Were you there at any other time?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When was that?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Oh, wait a minute. I want to correct that earlier answer. I was in Denver in 1943. I didn't live there but I went there on a business trip. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did your trip have any connection with work before the National War Labor Board?
Mrs. WILDMAN. No. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you at any time have any contact with the National War Labor Board in Denver? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. To the best of my recollection the answer is "no."
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Philip Reno, an employee of the National War Labor Board in Denver?
Mrs. WILDMAN. This question I shall refuse to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know Philip Reno in Washington ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. This question I shall also refuse to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right, now, the last employment that you have told us about was in 1944 for a labor union, the name of which you refuse to give us. What was your next employment?
Mrs. WILDMAN. My next employment was preparing War Labor Board cases for another labor union.
Mr. TAVENNER. A different union. Were your duties similar in the two instances?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the period of time you were so employed?
Mrs. WILDMAN. In that particular capacity-see, there was a period of time out there, there was a period of time that I didn't work. I am finding it a little bit difficult to reconstruct the dates. Sometime from nineteen-from some time in 1945 until some time in 1947, I believe.
Mr. TAVENNER. How were you employed between 1944 and some time in 1945 when you began this new employment?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Oh, I was employed giving birth to my third child.
Mr. TAVENNER. During this period from 1945 to 1947, did you handle any labor problems before the National Labor Relations Board in Washington ? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. I am trying to recall, Mr. Tavenner. But I don't remember having done so. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4011 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your employment after 1947? (Representative Donald L. Jackson entered the hearing room at this point.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. I became regional director for a labor union.
Mr. SCHERER. What labor union ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question. (Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room at this point.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Having been directed to answer, my answer is the same. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. And I restate for the record that we do not accept that answer because we feel that she is improperly invoking the fifth amendment in her refusal to answer as to what labor union she works for. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Chairman, one, I would like to know whether
Mr. Scherer is speaking for the entire subcommittee. First, I would like to know that. And then I would like to make another comment -on what he has to say.
Mr. MOULDER. I understand that in invoking the provisions of the Constitution you have stated all of theMrs. WILDMAN. No, sir; I excluded article II because I don't have a :gun, and I excluded article III because the question of barracking soldiers in my house hasn't come up. And I don't expect it to.
Mr. MOULDE. You asked a question. The statement made by Congressman Scherer is made by unanimous consent of all the committee.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Then, may I make a comment, Mr. Chairman: I mean, is Mr. Scherer the only one entitled to make comments ?
Mr. SCHERER. Regular order. You are here to answer questions or invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to answer.
Mrs. WILDMAN. I would like to-I thought people had as much rights as Congressmen did. I thought I am as good a person as you are, even though you have a higher back to your chair.
Mr. SCHERER. I don't happen to have belonged to the Communist Party. That is the chief difference. Otherwise I think you are as good a person as I am.
Mrs. WILDMAN. May I make a brief comment, Mr. Chairman? I assure you I won't take up much time.
Mr. SCHERER. Do you deny that you were a member of the Communist Party, Madam?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I have asked the chairman a question, Mr. Scherer. Do you have to be rude enough to interrupt before I get an answer?
Mr. SCHERER. I ask for regular order.
Mr. MOULDER. The request is refused. Will the witness please respond to the questions asked by counsel, and let's proceed in an orderly manner.
Mr. TAENNER. M rs. Wildman, in 1947, when you were made regional director of a labor union, were you director for the same labor union that you were employed by between the years 1945 and 1947, or was it a different union ? 4012 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. WILDMAN. It was the same one.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your next employment after 1947?
Mrs. WILDMAN. After 1947 I became the executive secretary of yet another organization.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Where? Geographically, you mean?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. Where were you?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Oh, at that time I was in Indianapolis, Ind.
Mr. SCHERER. Just a minute, Mr. Tavenner. I ask that the witness tell us of what organization she became executive secretary after 1947.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Chairman, I decline to answer the question.
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. The committee does not accept the answer for the reasons I have stated. Let's get the record clear.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where was your office located in the city to which you just referred? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Tavenner, first, I don't remember the address. Second, if I did remember it, I wouldn't give it.
Mr. TAVENNER. You said that your office was in Indianapolis, Ind. Was it at 635 North Pennsylvania, room 304?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was the organization, of which you were then the secretary, the Progressive Party of Indiana ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you secure your position as secretary of the organization that you referred to ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your employment began in 1947 in that capacity. How long did it last ? (The witness confers with her counsel.) 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I am restricting my answer to what I have already admitted, that I was the executive secretary of an organization, and I continued to work in that capacity until January of 1949.
Mr. TAVENNER. How were you employed after 1949?
Mrs. WILDMAN. As a leal secretary.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where.
Mrs. WILDMAN. In a law office in Indianapolis.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you also retain your position or office with the organization that you had been with between 1947 and 1949
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. You have told us you were employed by that organization from 1947 to 1949. Do you mean you are telling us that you will refuse to answer whether your employment continued after that date? I can't understand that answer.
Mr. SCHERE. I ask that the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mrs. WILDMAN. I am a little bit confused about the question. Would you hold up just a minute, please ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4013 (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes. Two things, Mr. Tavenner. What was that question again?
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you read her the question? (The record was read by the reporter as follows:) You have told us you were employed by that organization from 1947 to 1949. Do you mean you are telling us that you will refuse to answer whether your employment continued after that date? I can't understand that answer. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. TO the best of my recollection, I was not employed by any organization during the time I was employed as a secretary in a law office in Indianapolis.
Mr. TAVENNER. During that period of time, did you retain your position, whether employed or not, or paid a salary or not? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. What position are you referring to, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. The position which you have described as secretary of an organization which you would not name.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Oh. Then my answer would be as follows: I don't recall, but if I did, I would decline to answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you serve in any capacity on the staff of the organization, whether you were paid for the services or not? And by the organization, I am referring to the one of which you said you were the secretary.
Mrs. WILDMAN. I would give exactly the same answer to that as to the previous question.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain employed after 1949 as legal secretary in a law office? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Until sometime in 1950.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your next employment?
Mrs. WILDMAN. My next employment was as secretary in a law office in Philadelphia.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you still employed there ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. In Philadelphia? No.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain employed in Philadelphia?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Until sometime in 1951.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you give us your next employment and each successive employment to the present time, please ? (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room at this point.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. After my employment in the law office in Philadelphia, I was employed as a secretary in a labor organization; which employment continued until August of 1952. Thereafter I was employed briefly-I think it was in 1954, but I wouldn't swear to it-in a law office in Butte, Mont., after which I was employed briefly as a secretary for a labor organization.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you employed in the law office in Butte, Mont.?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I honestly don't remember. It was an insignificant job, and it was a month or two or perhaps three, but I don't remember. 4014 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. How were you employed between 1952 and 1954, if at all ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Oh, well, you know that included that period in Butte in a law office for a brief period of time, and a brief period of employment as a secretary for a labor organization. What was the period that you were talking about? Until when?
Mr. TAVENNER. From 1952 to 1954. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. MARGOLIS. That was not the question you asked, Mr. Tavenner. It is very confusing.
Mr. TAVENNER. She answered it. She said from 1952 on up until she took a position as secretary for a labor organization; it included the period of Butte, Mont.
Mr. MARGOLIS. She asked you what period your last question referred to.
Mrs. WILDMAN. 1952 to 1954; didn't it? Oh. I thought to 1954.
Mr. MARGOLIS. I don't think the record will show that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Regardless of what it was, will you give us your employment between 1952 and the present date?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Well, you know, I have covered part of it; yes. In 1954 I went to work in a medical office in Los Angeles, and I am currently employed there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Wildman, during the course of extensive investigation in the city of Washington and other places, the committee, in ascertaining for the first time the existence of 2 organized groups of the Communist Party within the staff of the National Labor Relations Board and also an organized group of the Communist Party within the staff of a Senate subcommittee, discovered the existence of 8 other organized groups of the Communist Party previously unknown to this committee in various Government agencies. Professor Herbert Fuchs testified that during 1936 and 1937 when he was employed by the Wheeler subcommittee of the Senate, he was directed to form a group of the Communist Party there, and during that period of time he, as the leader of that group, met with the leaders of others groups of the Communist Party organized within Government agencies on a section level. He told the committee the names of a number of those persons who were leaders of these various groups. I want to ask you to give the committee all of the information you have about this section of the Communist Party of which Professor Fuchs was a member. (The witness confers with her counsel.) (Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Fuchs identified several persons as heads of Communist Party groups and who met on a section level. One was Eleanor Nelson. Were you acquainted with Eleanor Nelson?
Mrs. WILDMAN. How many questions do I have before me, Mr. Tav*enner?
Mr. TAVENNER. One question. Are you acquainted with Eleanor Nelson ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer the question. 1 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4015 
Mr. MOULDE. For the reasons previously stated ? 
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes, sir. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know the department or agency of the Government in which Eleanor Nelson worked ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know in what department or agency of the Government Arthur Stein was employed?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Arthur Stein ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I also decline to answer that question.
Mr. MOULDER. In all instances where you say you decline to answer, are you claiming the privilege and reasserting theMrs. WILDMAN. I am if it is necessary, Mr. Chairman. I understand that I am required to, you know, state my reasons for declining to answer only if I am directed to answer. Therefore, I have just been declining. If this is incorrect, why, then, I will always say that I am declining to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. MOULDER. You are incorrect in your first statement.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Well, then, retroactively I say all my declinations are on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know in what branch of the Government in the District of Columbia Philip Reno was then employed ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Philip Reno ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. Did you know Reno as a member of the Communist Party, Witness? 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know what branch of the Government Sidney Katz was employed?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know Sidney Katz ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how Julia Katz was employed ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with her ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. The fact is, Witness, that you knew all of these people mentioned, and you knew them to be members of the Communist Party. Isn't that right?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Scherer, don't try to flummox me. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Bernard Stern?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know in what branch of the Government he was employed? 4016 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with the wife of Bernard Stern? (The witness confers with her counsel.) 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know in what branch of the Government she was employed? 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it not a fact that her name is Janet Buck Gaines Stern, your sister? 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. She was a Communist, wasn't she
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated. 
Mr. SCHERER. All of these people Mr. Tavenner, whom you are naming, have been identified as members of the Communist Party or have admitted membership in the Communist Party ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Professor Fuchs testified before the committee, under oath, that all of the persons I have named were leaders in various groups of the Communist Party and met on a section level with him, including Jessica Rhine, the present witness, now Mrs. Jessica Wildman.
Mr. SCHERER. And they were all employees of the Federal Govern- ment? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. SCHERER. And they were leaders of various cells in various agencies of the Federal Government?
Mr. TAVENNER. That is correct.
Mr. SCHERER. And these leaders met, as you say, on a sectional basis?
Mr. TAVENNER. That is correct. That was his testimony. I want to ask this witness now whether or not she met on a section level with Professor Fuchs and any of the persons whose names I have inquired about.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Tavenner, first, the question, I believe, is based on your assumption that this Fuchs person was truthfully testifying, which is an assumption I don't make. But I do decline to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. Is anything that Mr. Fuchs said about you untrue- that is, you being a member of the Communist Party and meeting in this sectional group? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Scherer, I am not going to get into a conflict with this committee about the testimony of any informers. Informers are universally accepted as unreliable characters. You may make your assumptions about his testimony, and I am sure I am entitled to make mine.
Mr. SCHERER. You voluntarily said to Mr. Tavenner that his question was based on the assumption that Fuchs' testimony was true. I am asking you whether any part of Fuchs' testimony, as it related to COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4017 you and your membership and activities in the Communist Party, was untrue In other words, did he lie to this committee in any respect? You have the opportunity to tell us right here and now as to whether Fuchs, this man whom you call an informer, was telling the truth or whether he was lying to this committee. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. If you say that he was lying to the committee, then I will ask that the Fuchs testimony be referred to the Department of Justice. Was Fuchs lying?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Are you through, Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCHERER. Yes, I am. 
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHEREE. I thought you would. You declined properly. I think you properly invoked the fifth amendment because if you had said that Fuchs was lying, in my opinion you would have been committing perjury.
Mrs. WILDMAN. I think if I had admitted any association whatever with Fuchs I would be testifying against myself. And I don't think your opinion means anything, Mr. Scherer. 
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time Professor Fuchs identified you as having attended these Communist Party meetings on a section level-that is, as a representative of a group of the Communist Party-you, according to your statement, were employed by the Railroad Retirement Board. While you were employed by the Railroad Retirement Board, was there a person known to you by the name of Abraham George Silverman connected with that organization ? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. I knew of him at the Railroad Retirement Board.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Abraham George Silverman play any part in obtaining your employment with the Board or in retaining you on the Board after you were employed there? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. Not as far as I know, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he known to you as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. You know I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, whether or not there was an organized group of the Communist Party, composed principally of employees, in the Railroad Retirement Board?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to your testimony, intermittently during your employment by the Railroad Retirement Board, you were assigned to duties with the WPA up until 1941. During that period of time was there an organized group of the Communist Party m Washington among the staff or employees of the WPA?
Mrs. WILDMAN. That is a funny question, because first it is inaccurate. I didn't say intermittently. I said for one brief period I happened to be technically on WPA payroll but I was working for the 4018 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA Railroad Retirement Board. There wasn't anything intermittent about it. It was just that one period. And beyond that, I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. So there was only one intermittent period. Regardless of number, was there an organized group of the Communist Party when you were so employed ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I don't agree on the "one intermittent period." I decline to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Henry Collins?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with John J. Abt, A-b-t?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Harry Dexter White ? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Harold Glasser ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Charles Kramer
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. Those persons that you have recently mentioned were the leading Communists in Government a few years ago.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Victor Perlo?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. All of these persons that I have just mentioned, Mr. Congressman, were identified as members of the Perlo group of the Communist Party, including also Henry Rhine. I did not ask the witness about Henry Rhine for a very obvious reason. Henry Rhine has been before this committee in our recent hearings in Washington and has refused to answer material questions, relying on the fifth amendment.
Mr. SCHERER. And that group, or part of them at least, participated in considerable espionage activities within the Government ?
Mr. TAVENNER. That was true, according to the testimony of Elizabeth T. Bentley. I should point out also that Professor Fuchs stated that during a part of the period-I am not sure that it was the entire period between 1936 and 1941-but for at least part of that period, he was required to report to his superior, who was Victor Perlo. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. DOYLE. Excuse me, Mr. Tavenner, you mentioned Professor Fuchs several times. The witness, I think, referred to him as an informer.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Yes, I did.
Mr. DOYLE. Who was Professor Fuchs, whom she described as an informer? I know he has testified before the committee and named these people as Communists. Who was he with reference to Government employment ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4019 
Mr. TAVENNER. Professor Fuchs became solicitor in the National Labor Relations Board, and later became the public member of the National War Labor Board in Denver. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. He withdrew from the Communist Party in 1946 and after that period of time became a professor of law at American University, Washington, D. C.
Mrs. WILDMAN. Isn't this all really a publicity discussion going on here? I don't see any search for information going on here now.
Mr. SCHERER. No, I think the committee is vitally interested in seeing that no more individuals like you obtain employment in the Government of the United States. That is what we are interested in. And we are going to pass legislation and do everything we can to see that that period in our history is never repeated. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. I have one question to ask the witness. How do you know that Professor Fuchs is an informer ?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I read about it in the newspapers.
Mr. DoyLE. Mr. Chairman, the reason I asked counsel to tell us who Professor Fuchs was was to have those in the hearing room know and have the record show clearly that he was just not any unusual person, or any incidental person, but that he was a person in high Government employ. And I assume he knew what he was talking about when he swore under oath that this witness was a member of the Communist Party. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, please, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, the members of the staff made an investigation back in 1950 regarding the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill, and the committee issued a report based on testimony resulting from that investigation. The Mundt bill was the one which originated in the Committee on Un-American Activities, and which is now before the Supreme Court. It is the Internal Security Act of 1950, requiring the Communist Party and front organizations to register, and which incorporated provisions of the Wood bill. I have before me exhibits 17, 19, 23, and 38 of the hearing held on October 19, 1950. The hearing developed that the officers of the National Lawyers Guild, in Washington, were made available to the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill, for the purpose of lobbying against and opposing that bill. And the National Lawyers Guild defrayed some very heavy items of expense in connection with that work.
Mr. SCHERER. The National Lawyers Guild, I forgot to say before, has been found to be the legal arm of the Communist Party of the United States.
Mr. MARGOLIs. Without a hearing, and with the same kind of due process you get right here. That is how it has been found. And it has asked for a hearing and never been given one.
Mr. MOULDER. Let's proceed, please.
Mr. TAVENNER. The National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill sent telegrams to various organizations and various Progressive Party officers throughout the country, as shown by these exhibits, for the purpose of opposing the legislation. Exhibit 17 of the hearing held on October 19, 1950, states that a copy of a telegram was addressed 4020 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA to Jessica Rhine, Progressive Party of Indiana, 635 North Pennsylvania, Room 304, Indianapolis, Ind. And other similar telegrams were addressed to ier under the same address. I would like to ask the witness whether she recalls having received in 1950 the various telegrams from the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill in Washington in her capacity as secretary of the Progressive Party of Indiana?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Mr. Tavenner, now you are trying to flummox me. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCHERER. What does the word "flummox" mean, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. I am not interested.
Mrs. WILDMAN. It is in the dictionary, Mr. Scherer; I promise. It means to engage in tomfoolery.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the context in which it was used, I am not interested. Were you a member of the Communist Party on the 27th day of August, 1950 ?
Mr. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party while employed by the Railroad Retirement Board
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at any time during the period between 1941 and 1949 while employed by various labor unions and while serving as a regional director of a labor union?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist Party now?
Mrs. WILDMAN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DoYLE. No questions.
Mr. MouLDER. Any questions, Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mrs. WILDMAN. May I take time and a half for Saturday?
Mr. MOULDER. Pardon me?
Mrs. WILDMAN. Do they pay time and a half for Saturday on witness fees?
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. The committee will stand in recess until 1: 30. (Whereupon, at 11:50 a. m., a recess was taken until 1:30 . m. this same day, there being present Representatives Moulder, Doyle, and Scherer.) AFTERNOON SESSION, APRIL 21, 1956 (The committee was reconvened at 1: 50 p. m., upon the expiration of the recess, there being present Representatives Moulder and Scherer.)
Mr. MOULDER. The committee will please be in order. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 4021 Let the record show, that the Honorable Francis Walter, chairman of the full Committee on Un-American Activities, has appointed a subcommittee consisting of three: Myself as chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Doyle, of California, and Congressman Scherer, of Ohio, to conduct the hearings in Los Angeles, Calif., on this date and on any future date until the hearings have been adjourned.
Mr. TAVENNER. A majority of which are present.
Mr. MOULDER. And the record should also show that there are present myself, as chairman of the subcommittee, and Congressman Scherer, of Ohio, constituting a quorum or a majority of the subcommittee duly appointed and established by the chairman of the full committee. Are you ready to proceed, Mr. Tavemer ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. Will Mr. Louis Sherman come forward, please ?
Mr. MOULDER. Please raise your right hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
Mr. SHERMAN. I do. TESTIMONY OF LOUIS R. SHERMAN, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, BEN MARGOLIS
