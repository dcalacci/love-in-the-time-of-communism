Mr. TAvxxNER. You were the sole owner of the corporation?
Mr. LAZARUS. AMr. Tavenner, I really don't know the legal end of thatMr. TAVENNER. There may have been qualifying shares in the names of other persons, in order to make up the necessary number of directors under the California law.
Mr. LAzARUs. Not that I know of.
Mr. 'ITAvENNEIR. There were no other stockholders?
Mr. LAZARUS. There were no other stockholders, so far as I know. As far as I remember-as far as I know.

Mr. LAZARUS. The title, the working title of that picturee was Salt of the Earth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Had you produced any other picture or worked in the production of any other pictures besides that one? (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. We did not l)roduce any other picture besides this one.I 
Mr. TAvxE- . Had you contracted for any picture other than that (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)

Mr. TAVENNit. Who is the secretary of the corporation ? (At this point Mr. ILaizaruis confferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. L.,Azuvs. Mi. Taviier, to answer this question I)ertainig to iamies that you will ask me from now on ill, of any names, I will ask the privilege of refuse to answer. I have it slight knowledge of the workings of this committeeMr. 'rAENm:n. Let 111 Lsk you it question at this point. Do you have the custody of the records of the corporation, or aire the records in tie custo(ly of its secretary?
Mr. LAZAIMS. I do not have it with me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand that.
Mr. LAZARUS. I do not have the recordsMAr. Are the records subject to your control?
Mr. LAZARUS. No.
Mr. TAVENE J. Then I will Iave to ask that you tell us who the secretary of the corporation is.
Mr. LAzARuS. I will have to answer you that I do not desire to name names before this committee. As I said, I have sat hcre the last few days and I have seen with my own eyes something that was a little bit repulsive to meMr. TAVENNER. Your answer is not responsive to my question.
Mr. LAZARUs. I am sorry, Mr. Tavenner. This is absolutely my answer. It has to be, because I have drawn certain conclusions from the meeting, from this forum, which makes me do things that I probably did not think of before. I think I have a perfect right to explain to you why I don't want to mention any names. And I am doing that. I am trying to tell you that I don't want to mention any names liecause this committee is only interested in naming names to blacklist these people.
Mr. Vumnn. Mr. Lazarus, the committee will listen to any reasons you have based upon logical, legal grounds for your refusal to answer. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. VELDE. But we don't care to listen to any lecture or any voluntary statements like you have been making. I direct you to answer the question that was asked of you by counsel. If you don't remember it, I will ask him to rephrase it or have the reporter read it t6 you.
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Velde, I haven't given you the reasons yet, all the reasons. I think I am entitled to have the privilege of addressing to you, as much as the other witnesses did. And I think you have left witnesses here talking to you for hours, with repeats. However, they did, and you let them, while I want to explain my reasons and you refuse.
Mr. VELD. If you will answer the question, Mr. Lazarus, we would probably give you the privilege of talking to us.
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Velde I-am explaining to you why I don't want to answer this question. I have a perfect right to explain the reasons. 31747-53--pt 2-4 482 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIE8 IN T118 1,014 ANOIEhtA AIRRA I want the American people to know, I am in front of television and I alll lit front of radio. I want them to know my reasons. 
Mr. Doyas. I feel as it member of this conittee, I want to sincerely counter youir charge that this committee is Inteested In blacklisting vI)ople. That is absolutely false. As a member of this committee, want you to understand that I am not interested in anyone being blacklisted unless they are tmbvoesive and intend to unlawfully overthrow my Government. (At this point Mr.LaIzarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. DoYLE. Those are the kind of people we are trying to discover . Are you a member of the Commanunist Party now V
Mr. LAzAnus. Now, Mr. Congressman, I have been|aiusinessinan for 37 years. I hmve been a good citizen in this conununit y for :17 years. I have not committed any crimes. I have made nothing but friends.
Mr. 1)oyiax. We don't say you have committed any crimes, hut I am asking you if you are a member of the Communist Part, flowI
Mr. LAZARus. Let me answo you 11thO way I feel lik answering. I have answered this question in front of other forums all over the country. I have made statements all over the country about my political affiliations. However, I refuse to make my political affliations In front of you, to tell you, for it reason, and this is tie season, my friend: If I tell oil what you wallet, to tell yoll-alld I have, to tell time tr-t10h, a11d _would be a very nice fellow, I would not he called any names, because I ain not the kind of fellow that you think I am. However if I say it ill front of this audience today, and tomorrow and 6 months froni now, and a year from iow, somebody would drag lme into court and state that I have perjured myself, anld then I have to go to court and I have to be dragged in. And at, my age, Con- gressman, I don't think I should do that, that you should ask me to do that.
Mr. DoYLe. We are not asking you to perjure yourself. We are asing )oil to tell the truth. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.) 
Mr. CLA-DY. MAr. Chairman, I suggest that counsel propound his question again so that we may get back to that.
Mr. Lz, RUs. By the wayMr. ChArDY. Just a moment, sir. I made a request of te chairman.
Mr. VamE. Will counsel propound his last. question?
Mr. TAVE.NzNE. The question, Mr. Lazarus, is this: Will you please advise the committee as to who the secretary of your corporation is at the present time?
Mr. LAzARus. I didn't hear the question.
Mr. TAVENNEXR. Will you please advise.the committee of the name of the secretary of your corporation, that is, the corporation of which you are the sole stockholder?
Mr. JACKSON. The Independent Productions Corp.
Mr. TAvENNER. The Independent Productions Corp. at the present time. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Tavenner, I refuse to answer this on the grounds that I propounded to you before, and I refuse it relying on tle Constitution of the United States, on the first amendment, and all of the amendments, especially the fifth amendment. COMMUNIST A'fIVITIES IN TIHA LOS ANGEL S ARIEA 483

(At this point Mr. Laza'us conferred with Mr. Margolis.) make clear Mr. Doyle's question before. I want to answer it in the same mantmr as I answered the other question, namely, that I am absolutely relying on the Constitution of the United States and on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. CLARDI. You mean you are refusing to answer on those grounds?
Mr. LAZAIMU. Yes, sir; on those grounds.
Mr. C1,AIDY. Would it be fair to say, then, that tany question we might ask you concerning the personnel connected with the corporation will be answered in tile sae way? That will shorten it up.
Mr. LAZARUS. Concerning the personnel, yes, sir; yes, sir..I would like to talk to you anything you w'ant about my personal affair in the corporation, of whic h I u1e. very proud. Now, if you desire to talk
Mr. LAZA1R11s. Before I answer yor question, I Woui(ld HIM to to me about the corporation from my standpoint, from my understanding, I will gladly answer your every question. But I will not nlntion any names.

Mr. LAZARUs. I became president of the corporation a year and a half or 2 years ago when I decided to go into the business of producing pictures. M r. AWVrTR. How did you become president?
Mr. LAxzARUs. I became president because I was the initiator of the thing, I was tho first investor in this corporation, and therefore I became the )resident.
Mr. WALTER. That isn't an answer to my question. Who nominated you for president?
Mr. LAZARUS. Tle original directors.
Mr. WALTER. Who were they ?
Mr. LAZARUS. I can't mention any names.
Mr. WALTER. Well now, if you had all of the stock, how could there have been other directors?
Mr. 'LAZARUS. Yes, we did. Originally, the corporation, I imagille(At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. My attorney tells me that the laws of California do not require a stockholder to be a director, or a director to be a stockholder.
Mr. WALTER. I don't know anything about the laws of California. I am assuming tlhat that is correct. Who were the incorporators of this company?
Mr. LAZARUS.

Mr'. Var1oa)r. Mr. IDoy le. Air. Dovrt:. I think I only have acouple of questions. (At this point Mr. Latzarus. conaferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. Jlloyixp. AMr. lUt'/artan1 I am assmnning in tasking you this question that you, apparently b~etng the onl stockholder to put any money into theo corporation, thtyo or amiliar with the script which wti8 going to be used in the production of this play. Now, fain not asking you again who wrote the script, because it apparently wol besees. 'Mr. LAZARUS. Yes. I think Mir. Doyle, you know the name. You know the name, why do you ask me?
Mr. DOYLE. 'rhaiks for giving me credit for knowing everything Mir. LAZARUS. I read the book.- I read the script. I wits very mileh in love with the script. Mir. DoyLE. Good. Were you familiar also with the names of any of the chief participants to be in the cast? Don't misunderstand me. I am not asking you nor I am not going to ask you the names of any 494 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA of the members of the cast. But when your corporation made this deal with the Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers outfit, were you then familiar with or prior thereto were you familiar with the names of any or all of the leading figures to be in the cast ?
Mr. LAZARUS. I was not familiar with any names of the cast.
Mr. DoYLE. All right. Thank you.
Mr. VnWE. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. Xo questions. 
Mr. V ni:t.Mr. Counsel, is there anything more?
Mr. TAVENNm. Yes sir; I think there is another question.
Mr. Lazarus I understood you to say in the early part of your testimony, I beheve you said you would not reveal the address ofthe office of your corporation. Did I understand you correctly or not?
Mr. LAZARUS. I really don't know the address of the corporation today, what address, it any, it does have. Originally it was my address. It was the address of my home when I first incorporated. It was 1250 Beverly Estate Drive, and then when I moved to different places I have changed the address to where I moved to.
Mr. TAvENNER.-What was the address of the office in September of 1951?
Mr. LAZARUS. I don't recollect September 1051.
Mr. TAVENNER. You don't recollect?
Mr. LAZARUS. I suppose you know it. It is in front of you. Will you please tell me, ask me the address and I will tell you whether it is correct or not? 
Mr. TAVENNER. All right, sir. I will try to refresh your recollection. I hand you what purports to be photostatic copies of the bank statement for your corporation covering the period from September 21 of 1951, to January 30, 1952, and ask that they be marked also as Lazarus' exhibit No. 6 for identification. (The document referred to was marked "Lazarus' Exhibit No. 6" for identification.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I will ask you to examine the name of the account and see whether or not the address of the account appears-I mean the address of the company appears as part of the account. (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. TAVENNER. May the record show flat ttose papers constitute Lazarus' exhibit No. 6 for identification onlyI (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. The address is the attorney's address, the attorneys of the corporation address.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is that address?
Mr. LAZARUS. It is 709, I think, Rives Strong Building, Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was that the address of your corporationI
Mr. LAZARUS. No that was the address of the attorneys.
Mr. TAVENNER. *hy did you give the bank the address of your attorney for your account, instead of your own company's address?
Mr. LAzARus. I really don't remember what was the reason at that" particular time." (At this point Mr. Lazarus conferred with Mr. Margolis.)
Mr. LAZARUS. I know that I was at that time in the process of moving from one place to the other. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THI LOS ANGLES AREA 495 
Mr. TAVENNER. It took quite long to move, from September 1,1951, to February 1052.
Mr. LAZARUS. I left it there from the first time we opened the account, we left the address there. We did not use it and the bank was at that time right across the street from me, the Union Bank, located on Eighth Street.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Tavenner, I might say tis: As a member of the California bar I know that it is quite the practice where there was a corporation such as this, owned entirely by one person, it is quite a usual thing for the official office of the corporation to be the office of legal counsel. It is not unusual at all.
Mr. 'VAVEN-4ER. I have no further questions.
Mr. Scif:mtx. Mr. Lazarus, I have in my hand a certified copy by the secretary of state of the State of California of the articles of incorporation of the Independent Producers Corp. I would like to have the witness look at this and identify it as the articles of incorporation of his corporation.
Mr. TAVENNER. I suggest that the photostatic copy be marked Lazarus' exhibit No. 7 for identification only. ' (The document referredto was marked "Lazarus' Exhibit No. 7" for identification.)
Mr. LAZARUS. Mr. Congressman there are other haines on the document presented to me, and therefore I will refuse to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. SCIEmtER. I haven't asked you about names; I am merely asking you whether that is a copy, a certified copy of the articles of incorporation of your corporation.
Mr. CLAnnY. Before you answer, turn it over and look at the certification on the back.
Mr. SuiEmtm. The certification is right on the front.
Mr. CLAnDY. There is a certification on the back.
Mr. LAZARUS. Gentlemen, I think you are not looking for any information. This information is right in front of you. Why do you want me to answer this, which is it certified copy of the franchise of the State of California Do you need additional information from me?
Mr. SCHERER. Yes, very much so.
Mr. LAZARUS. I am not going to give it to you on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JAcXsoN. Mr. Chairman, that is obviously an abuse of the privilege. I ask that the witness be directed to answer whether or not that is a copy of the articles of incorporation.
Mr. VELDE. Yes, the Chair feels that that is a perfectly legitimate question and can be answered.
Mr. JACKSON. The constitutional amendment can be stretched just so far.
Mr. VEE. Therefore I direct the witness to answer the question.
Mr. MAROOLIS, May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman? If he answers that question will it be considered a waiver with respect to any of the names that appear thereon?
Mr. CQARDY. What?
Mr. MARGOLIS. Will it be considered a waiver of his rights with respect to any of the names that appear on the documents 400 COMMUNIWt' AVIIII $IN TH 1.09~ ANGUtL141 AIIUA Oi tl111 lel, io lilts to know ill ordor ito ktnow Whether 110 t'malit jprivitt'go.
