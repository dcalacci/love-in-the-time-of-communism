Mr. TAvENNER. Will you describe more fully what your connection has been with the radio industry?
Mr. BROWN. In the radio industry I am also a free-lance actor. I have done a great deal more work in radio than pictures. I have played mostly comedy parts, as a straight man or comedian. I have also played dramatic roles in dramatic--I don't know whether you know the situation. An actor is called for practically everything that is going -on. Im New York, for instance, there are a great many so-calle-d soap operas, which I did a good deal of, and out here on the coast I have done mostly comedy shows. communwr AC1vrrIs iN TH LOS A maGLS AREA 8509

Mr. TAVENwxi. How were you employed at the time you left New York and came to Los Angeles?
Mr. BROWN. As a radio actor.
Mr. TAvENNRE. Mr. Brown, have you had the opportunity, either in New York or in Los Angeles, to observe any of the workings of the Communist Party?
Mr. BROWN. I decline to answer that question on the grounds of the fifth amendment, on the grounds that my answer might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAvENm. Were you at any time affiliated with the Communist Party in the city of New York?
Mr. BROWN. I decline to answer that question, sir, on the same grounds.
Mr. TAvNNzRL Have you at any time been affiliated with the Communist Party in Los AngelesI

Mr. Donz. Are you a registered voter in the State of California?
Mr. BROWN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Have you continuously registered as a voter in the State of California since you came here ?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, sir.
Mr. Do-E. I don't question your right to raise the fifth amendment. I am a lawyer, too, I wish to say to counsel. But I am disappointed in your doing it, sir. I want to make that very clear to you. I don't criticize it, but I am disappointed. Because we are here as a subcommittee of your own Congress on a very difficult assignment We are trying to help uncover the subversive elements in our Nation. . I have just come back from Europe. I had been there 30 days. And again I find the best evidence we can get that there is a conspiracy over there emanating directly from the Soviet Union, and it is sulstantially the same as it is in your country and mine. I hope the time will come before you are much older, Mr. Brown, that with the advice of your counsel, you will feel the protection of your country, and to help the committee uncover whatever there is, if you know anything, about subversive conspiracy in our Nation. I think that is all Mr. Jackson.
