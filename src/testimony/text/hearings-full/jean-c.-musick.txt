Mr. MUSICK. My primary and secondary education were the usual ones in Colorado. I was given a scholarship at the University of 3968 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA Rochester, Eastman School of Music, in Rochester, N. Y. I attended this scholarship for 4 years, during which time I earned my way, my living expenses through school, I earned my expenses for school plus the aid that the scholarship allowed me for expenses at the school itself. During the 4 years in which I retained the scholarship I was an honor student scholastically. I was chairman of my class for 3 of those 4 years, and during the first 3 years I completed 4 years of schooling with the exception of 6 academic hours which I took at summer session, giving me my bachelor of music degree. During my fourth year of scholarship I pursued graduate studies and completed all of the work for my master's degree, with the exception of the writing of the thesis which I did during the following year, and received my degree in 1933. Since that time I have pursued the study of my profession privately, and occasionally had course in extension at the university, classes in various things.

Mr. MOULDER. First may I say that it is a photostatic copy of the document. You did not sign that document. You could truthfully answer that, couldn't you, one way or the other?
Mr. MUSICK. I understand.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. There is a statement in this document, which I read: I am registered as affiliated with the Independent Progressive Party. Were you so registered on March 23, 1948? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MUSICK. Mr. Tavenner, I decline to answer that question on the same grounds as previously stated, and for the same reasons.
Mr.TAVENNER. YOU actually became a member of the State central committee; did you not?
Mr. MUSICK. Would you repeat the question?
Mr. TAVENNER. You actually became a member of the State central committee of the Independent Progressive Party; did you not?
Mr. MUSICK. I believe the document showed it was titled a county central committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Thank you for correcting me. It is Los Angeles.
Mr. MUSICK. I will decline to answer that question on the same basis for the same reasons as the former one, for the same subject.
Mr. TAVENNER. If that document speaks the truth, it shows that you aspired at least to become a member of the Los Angeles County Central Committee of the Independent Progressive Party. From that information and other information in the hands of the committee, which it has received in the form of sworn testimony before the committee, you should be in a position to give this committee important facts relating to the plan of the Communist Party in 1948 to use musicians who were members of the Communist Party to promote the interests of the Independent Progressive Party. Will you give us the benefit of such information as you have?
Mr. MUSICK. Mr. Tavenner and Mr. Chairman, I must decline to answer that question on the basis of the first and fifth amendments, as previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a document marked for identification only as "Jean C. Musick Exhibit No. 2." It is a photostatic copy of a petition of the Independent Progressive Party, at the end of which appears an affidavit over the signature of Jean C. Musick, bearing date of January 31, 1948. I ask you whether or not that is your signature as the affiant in that affidavit. (Document handed to witness and his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. It is on the last page.
Mr. MUSICK. Mr. Tavenner, I decline to identify the petition or the signature on the grounds as previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence marked "Jean C. Musick Exhibit No. 2."
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (This exhibit is similar to Kalman Block exhibit No. 1, p. 3957, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.) (Document returned to Mr. Tavenner.)
Mr. TAVENNER. The document is dated January 31,1948. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3973 On that day were you a member of branch 0 of the northwest section of the Communist Party, sometimes referred to as the Musicians Branch of the Communist Party ?
Mr. MusicK. I wish to decline to answer that question on the basis of the constitutional grounds of the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. MUSICK. I wish to decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle ?
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you have a question, Mr. Scherer ?
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Musick, you have refused to answer the pertinent questions asked by Mr. Tavenner on the grounds of the fifth amendment. You have invoked your privilege under the fifth amendment in refusing to answer those questions, and I think you have invoked it properly. By invoking the fifth amendment you have said that you did not want to answer the questions because you, in good faith, felt that if you answered those questions, those answers might tend to incriminate you, might result in some prosecution in the future. But as Mr. Tavenner said, we feel that you, in particular, have some information that would be very helpful to the committee. Now the law is that this committee may grant you immunity, with the approval of a Federal court. In other words, we may say to you that no matter what your answers are to the questions asked you cannot be prosecuted, you cannot be incriminated. The law gives this committee that right. Now, if this committee should grant you immunity so that no matter what answers you gave to the questions propounded, you could not be prosecuted, would you then answer the questions we ask you ?
Mr. MUSICK. Excuse me, I don't believe I know your name.
Mr. SCHERER. Scherer. You may want to consult with your counsel before answering that question.
Mr. MUSICK. I am sure my counsel will know the proper things to say, but I feelMr. SCHERER. That is the reason I say if you want to you should consult with him.
Mr. MUSICK. I feel this is a matter of conjecture. It doesn't exist and at this time I am not in a position to answer the question.
Mr. SCHERER. I wanted to know, because if the committee should decide to grant you immunity, it requires considerable effort and time. You have said the only reason you are not answering the question is because you fear some prosecution. If that fear of prosecution is removed wouldn't you be willing to tell what you knew? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MusIcK. Mr. Scherer, I did not use the word "fear" in any of my reasons in declining. I do not have fear. I stated my grounds that the ConstitutionMr. SCHERER. That is what the fifth amendment says, that you in good faith feel-that means fear-feel that to answer the questions might incriminate you. You fear prosecution. 3974 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. MUSICK. My understanding of semantics is that there is a difference between the words "fear" and "feel." And that is the only reason I mention it.
Mr. SCHERER. If you don't fear prosecution, the fear that you might be prosecuted, then of course it doesn't seem that you are invoking the fifth amendment in good faith.
Mr. MusICK. I am invoking the fifth amendment in good faith, but the additional reason is contained in the first amendment, that I feel that the inquiry is beyond the sphere ofMr. SCHERER. Of course, that has been already established, that the inquiry concerning your Communist membership and any knowledge you might have of subversive activities is certainly within the scope of this committee, and that is well established. There is no basis for that. That is all I have. I just wanted to see whether these witnesses are actually invoking the fifth amendment in good faith, if they actually fear or feel that they might be prosecuted as a result of any information they might give the committee. I can't understand, if that threat of prosecution or possibility of prosecution is removed, why any citizen should not say, who invokes the fifth amendment, "Why, certainly, I will answer."
Mr. JACKSON. Can't you really understand or are youMr. SCHERER. I really understand.
Mr. JACKSON. Or are you being naive ?
Mr. SCHERER. I really understand, Mr. Jackson, but in some casesI am not saying in this one-it is evident that the fifth amendment is not invoked in good faith. There is actually no fear or feeling of prosecution. It is just an unwillingness to cooperate. And the ffth amendment is used for that purpose.
Mr. MOULDER. Any further questions?
Mr. SCHERER. NO. 
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Tavenner
Mr. TAVENNER. No further questions.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. May I inquire, Mr. Tavenner, how many more witnesses do we have for this afternoon?
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe four.
Mr. MOULDER. Let's proceed to call the next witness.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Manuel Newman.
Mr. MoULDER. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. NEWMAN. I do. (Representative Gordon H. Scherer left the hearing room at this point.) TESTIMONY OF MANUEL NEWMAN, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, ROBERT KENNY
