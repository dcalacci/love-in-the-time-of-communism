Mr. WOOD. We will permit you to file whatever statement you desire at the conclusion of your testimony.
Mr. CARNOVSKY. It is very short. I believe it gives a very good background of my whole point of view. 
Mr. WooD. First of all, we would like you to give heed to the ques- tions that are going to be asked you, and answer the questions if you can, and- 
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I was here yesterdayMr. Woon (continuing). Then you shall be at liberty to file any statement you desire to file with the committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mr. Morris Carnovsky? 
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I am Morris Carnovsky.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented by counsel?
Mr. CARNOVsKY. I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel please identify himself for the record
Mr. POPPER. Martin Popper, 160 Broadway, New York. 390 INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Carnovsky? 
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I was born in St. Louis, Mo., on September 5, 1897. I am 53.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you used any name other than the name that you have just given?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. That is my professional name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your professional name? Do you have any other name?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I have no other name. I was born with that name.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were born with that name?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. Yes.
Mr. POPPER. Excuse me. 
Mr. Chairman, do I understand that you are reading that [indicating prepared statement of the witness] in order to determine whether Mr. Carnovsky might read the statement in the record ?
Mr. WooD. I am reading it to determine whether or not it is going to be permitted to be filed with the committee.
Mr. POPPER. I see. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation?
Mr. CARNovSKY. I am an actor. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you trace briefly for the committee both your educational background and your record of employment.
Mr. CARNovSKY. Yes. I received the usual thorough, complete American education, begining with grammar school in St. Louis, going on to high school for 4 years, and then 5 years in Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. I concentrated on literary subjects mainly, languages, a little philosophy, history, and I graduated with honor, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1920. I then almost immediately made up my mind to become an actor. I came east. I went to Boston for a season with a stock company, then continued on to New York, where it did not take me very long to become employed. I started with a play at Provincetown Playhouse. I was noticed by the Theater Guild, who employed me in The Failures, St. Joan, and after a brief further interlude in stock I returned to New York. And then followed a wide variety of parts, characters, and leading parts, in a number of plays, classic and modern. (Representative Harold H. Velde returned to the hearing room.)
Mr. CARNOVSKY (continuing). Of these there were plays by Maxwell Anderson, Shaw, Sidney Howard, and so on, a great variety of parts I played. I became known as an e4remely competent character actor. I went to Hollywood, interrupting my stage career, I believe it was in 1935, if I am not mistaken, and appeared in the Life of Emile Zola at Warner Bros. Returning, I resumed my theatrical career and again played in Edge of Darkness. I believe, also at Warner's. Finally I made my home in Hollywood. I believe this was in 1943, if I am not mistaken. I was asked to come out and play in Rhapsody in Blue, by Warner Bros. I played the father. And thereafter I have been a free-lance actor, with a few interims of coming back to New York and playing in plays. I played a great number of parts in Hollywood, pictures like Our Vines Have Tender Grapes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. What are some of the best well-known?  
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I am mentioning them now. 391 I believe Rhapsody in Blue, Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, and Cyrano, which was my last picture, possibly Cornered at RKO-I think these are the high points. An actor of my kind fills in with all kinds of engagements, takes pretty much what comes along. My last play was Ibsen's Enemy of the People, on Broadway, and on the road a play by Sam Behrman, called Let Me Hear the Melody. That brings me up to date.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you spend any time outside of the continental limits of the United States?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. For a brief time I was in England, and I spent 4 days in France-Paris.
Mr. TAVEN'NER. What year was that?
Mr.'CARNOVSKY. That was just before the war, 1937, I would say. Am I right? 1937.
Mr. TAVENNER. How much time did you spend abroad on that trip ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. Not very long. It was about-I think we were about 4 months in London and 4 days in Paris.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that the only time you have traveled to the Continent?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. That is the only time; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were describing your activities and experience in New York. Were you a member of the Group Theater at that time?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. Mr. Tavenner, there are a number of organiza- tions, all of which have been listed by this committee, of which the organization you just mentioned is one. I feel that I am here under a strong apprehension of danger in saying otherwise than that I now seek the protection of the fifth amendment and avail myself of my privilege to refuse to answer on the grounds that this would tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. So on that ground you refuse to answer the question about any alleged association of membership in the Group Theater?
Mr. CARNovsKY. On that ground I refuse to answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member or affiliated in any way with the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I decline to answer on the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. The Civil Rights Congress ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I decline to answer on the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Progressive Citizens of America?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I decline to answer on the ground previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Profes- sions ? 
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I decline to answer on the same ground. 
Mr. TAVENNER. The American Peace Mobilization ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I decline to answer on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Carnovsky, the committee is in possession of information that you held in 1944 a membership book in the Communist Party, bearing the number 48975. Did you hold such a book? 
Mr. CARNovSKY. I decline to answer on the ground previously stated. 392 INDUSTRY 
Mr. TAVENNER. You were present this morning during the tf' " mony of Mr. Marc-M-a-r-c-Lawrence?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I was present. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you not?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. You no doubt heard his statement that he attended Communist Party meetings in your home.
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I heard everything he said.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hear that statement?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I heard that statement.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that true ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated. SMr. TAVENNER. By that you mean that to answer the question of whether or not Communist Party meetings were held in your home might tend to subject you to criminal prosecution?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you at any time been a mem- ber of the Communist Party?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. Mr. Tavenner, there is no force in Government which can compel a citizen, as I understand it, to disclose his political, social, or religious affiliations. I regard this whole approach as unwarranted prying into the most secret and sacred areas of a man's thought. And since this has already been established in the work of this committee I regretfully and shamefully have to go on to claim myMr. WOOD. Will you answer the question ?
Mr. CARNovsKY. I believe I am answering it. I am about to come to my conclusion.
Mr. WOOD. You were asked a simple question, whether you are now or have ever been a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. CARNOvsKY. I am giving my answer.
Mr. WOOD. Do you desire to answer?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I am answering it.
Mr. JACKSON. Is the answer "Yes" or "No"?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. The answer is now that I claim the protection of the fifth amendment, and I decline to answer on the ground that this would incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no other questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. KEARNEY. I just have one question. When you took the stand here the chairman swore you to an oath in which you said you would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Do you feel in your own mind and heart that you have fulfilled that oath?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I do, sir.
Mr. WALTER. As I understand your position, you feel that if you would admit that you were the holder of that Communist Party card you might be prosecuted in a criminal case for what you have admitted here. Is that correct ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I feel that under the fifth amendment I have the right to decline to answer that statement and that question, and I stand on it.
Mr. WALTER. But, now, let's get this straight. You are fearful, and that is why you invoke the protection given by the fifth amendment to people charged with crimes, that the testimony adduced here might be used against you in a criminal proceeding. Is that correct?  393 
Mr. CARNOVSKY. That is as I understand it, sir; yes.
Mr. WALTER. Don't you know under the law any testimony given here cannot be used anywhere else ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. That is not the fact, Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. Do you get your legal opinions from the New Yorker, also ?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I get my legal opinions basically from the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.
Mr. WALTER. Of course, the statute that I have referred to is a law enacted under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It was enacted for the very purpose of affording protection to people who come forward and assist congressional committees in fulfilling their obligation to the Congress and to the people of the United States. There is a statute that expressly protects the witness from any use of any testimony he gives in any other proceeding.
Mr. CARNOVSKY. Mr. Walter, it seems you have not read the recent case passed upon by the Supreme Court.
Mr. WALTER. What case was that? Why don't you answer, Mr. Popper?
Mr. POPPER. I think that is a good idea, sir, because I know you were a distinguished lawyer long before you were in Congress. The fact of the matter is the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly said, and said very recently, that there is no such thing as an immunity statute.
Mr. WALTER. I am not so certain this exact question has been passed upon.
Mr. POPPER. Oh, yes. May I refer you to United States against Bryan.
Mr. WALTER. Yes. I know the case. You still decline to answer because you are afraid you might be prosecuted criminally for any testimony you give. Is that correct?
Mr. CARNOVSKY. I refuse to answer, because this might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Moulder.
Mr. MOULDER. No, -thank you.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. I have no questions.
Mr. WooD. Further questions?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Counselor, is there any reason why this witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir. (Witness excused.)
Mr. WooD. We will take a recess until 10 o'clock in the morning.
Mr. POPPER. Mr. Chairman, may I merely say this: One witness here was subpenaed twice. That witness is Mr. Carnovsky, one subpena returnable yesterday and one tomorrow. I take it you are excusing him in connection with both subpenas.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Yes. This witness is excused.
