Mrs. JAMES. Yes, I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are the wife of Mr. Dan James ?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, I am.
Mr. WooD. Mrs. James, I wonder if you would mind pulling your chair just a little closer to the table and maybe the amplifier will carry your voice a little better.
Mrs. JAMES. My name is Lilith James.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state that again ?
Mrs. JAMES. Lilith, L-i-l-i-t-h.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell it again ?
Mrs. JAMES. L-i-l-i-t-h.
Mr. TAVENNER. In what profession are you engaged, Mrs. James?
Mrs. JAMES. I am a writer-housewife.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged in the profession of writing?
Mrs. JAMES. My first writing was in connection with a musical, Bloomer Girl, which was produced in 1944.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were you then living ?
Mrs. JAMES. In Hollywood.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. James, did you hear the testimony this morning of Mr. Martin Berkeley ? 
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Berkeley, as you may have heard, testified that you were at one time a member of the Communist Party. I would like to ask you if you have ever been a member of the Communist Party.
Mrs. JAMES. I am not a Communist, Mr. Tavenner, but I decline to answer the rest of the questions on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. I haven't asked you but one part of the question that you think I have asked you.
Mrs. JAMES. All right.
Mr. TAVENNER. My question was whether you ever have been a member of the Communist Party.
Mrs. JAMES. I must decline-I will decline to answer under the fifth amendment. 1632 
Mr. TAVENNER. But you have indicated, from what you said, that you are not now a member of the Communist Party.
Mrs. JAMES. No, I am not, nor am I a sympathizer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, when did you leave the Communist Party?
Mrs. JAMES. I didn't say I had ever been a Communist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party be- fore these hearings began, say, on Sunday of this past week?
Mrs. JAMES. I decline on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party on Monday ?
Mrs. JAMES. I decline, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party on Tuesday ?
Mrs. JAMES. I decline.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party when you entered this room today?
Mrs. JAMES. No, I was not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member in 1944 ? 
Mrs. JAMES. I decline to answer on the grounds of the fifth amend- ment. - 
Mr. TAVENNER. HOW long were you engaged in the work on Bloomer Girl?
Mrs. JAMES. For about a year, a year and a half.
Mr. TAVENNER. During what period of time was that? 
Mrs. JAMES. Beginning early in 1943, I believe, up until the tima of its production, which was in October of 1944.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter, any questions ?
Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle, any questions?
Mr. DOYLE. You mentioned you were a writer and a housewife.
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Are there some little Jameses ? 
Mrs. JAMES. There is a little James and a big James.
Mr. DOYE. So that you are not now engaged in writing very much ?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes; I am still engaged in writing.
Mr. DOYLE. I noticed that your answer-you said, "I am not a Communist and I do not sympathize with communism," or something like that. You used almost the exact wording that your husband used in the same answer. Now, I know that, of course, you and your husband have discussed this hearing and how you would answer that question, haven't you?
Mrs. JAMES. Of course.
Mr. DOYLE. Of course. Perfectly natural that you should. criticize you for doing it, of course. I don't I couldn't help but notice that your wording was almost exact. Now, were you a Communiat 30 days ago?
Mrs. JAMES. I decline to answer, Mr. Doyle. 
Mr. DOYLE. Well, why do you decline to answer?
Mrs. JAMES. I feel that an answer to this question might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. DOYLE. You state that you were not a Communist when you came in the door. Why, then, wouldn't you tell us if you were a Communist 30 days ago  1633 
Mrs. JAMES. I believe this is a legal question.
Mr. DOYLE. I am not trying to make it a legal question. becaInu you have a very able lawyer by your side there.
Mr. WIRIN. I will be glad to answer any questions that are put to me-most any questions.
Mr. DOYLE. You heard your husband a few minutes ago state that he thought that, in substance-I believe he stated, because I made a note of it, that he felt that. this committee should investigate subversive people and programs. You heard him so state, and I think he added that, however, some of the crop might be hurt when we were getting at the weeds.
Mrs. JAMES. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. You heard that?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, what is your idea about whether or not the United States Congress should investigate subversive people and programs of subversive groups? Should we or shouldn't we?
Mrs. JAMES. I feel this is a question of my opinion, sir. I don't know. I am not a student of political affairs. I know that this committee is acting within its rights. However, I have my own conscience, and I am taking my stand within my rights under the fifth amendment and what I feel right as my conscience dictates to me.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, I would agree with you, Mrs. James, that you must follow the dictates of your conscience in connection with your patriotic obligation to your whole nation which gave you birth, I think, and perhaps your children birth. We are not urging you to waive your conscience in any way. I am sure you understand that, don't you ?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. But when you say that you are sure this committee is acting within its rights, we are not only acting within our rights, we are acting under a directive from the United States Congress which is embodied in a Federal statute which says that our duty is to come and ask you what you know about subversive people and subversive groups, so it is the United States Congress that is asking you, through us. It is not this committee, only. It is the whole United States Congress. You understand, don't you?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, I understand.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, your husband-I want to repeat to you-a few minutes ago, therefore, said he felt that we should investigate subversives and what is your idea? Should we or should we not?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, I feel you should do your job.
Mr. DOYE. You help us, please, investigate it. Do you know of any Communist fronts active in this area now ?
Mrs. JAMES. I must decline to answer your question on the previous grounds.
Mr. DoYE. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. JAMES. I decline to answer on the previous grounds. 
Mr. DoYLE. Have you any recommendation as to how this committee can investigate subversive people and programs, as long as you have stated you thought we ought to? How shall we get at it?
Mrs. JAMES. Are you asking my opinion, Mr. Doyle ?
Mr. DOYLm. Yes; I am. 1634 
Mrs. JAMES. Well, I feel that this committee has certainly found the Communists are not being a very effective voice in Hollywood, because I think most of the witnesses who have been here have said that they are not influencing the films that are distributed to the American people, so I don't feel thatit 
Mr. DOYLE. I know. But I am asking you, How shall we investigate
Mrs. JAMES. That is your job, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. I know it is our job.
Mrs. JAMEs. I don't wish to give an opinion. 
Mr. DoYE. And our job is to get your help. And your help, we believe, is to come clean and help us investigate subversive conduct in Hollywood. Now, you haven't answered that. Have you any way that we can get at the subversive people, the people that would uproot our constitutional form of government and favor Soviet Russia? Have you any recommendation of what we shall do ? You don't tell us anything about what you know about communism.
Mrs. JAMES. No; I have no recommendation.
Mr. DOYLE. Why don't you tell us what you know about it and heln us? (The witness made no answer.)
Mr. DOYE. I don't want to urge you or hurry you to do it; I want you to take plenty of time to answer that question. Take more time if you want before you answer it. But why don't you help us, Mrs. James? You've got some young children growing up. Why don't you help us in the field of communistic influences in Hollywood ?
Mrs. JAMES (conferring with counsel). I will try to answer your question, Mr. Doyle, and this isn't what my lawyer just advised me.
Mr. DOYLE. I am glad you consulted your lawyer. 
Mrs. JAMES. I feel that it is quite possible to be opposed to commu- nism and its principles and its alliance to the Soviet Union and to be in support of our Government, our Government's policy in Koreawhich I certainly am-and still feel that it is not an American rule to have to name names of people when it will influence their lives and their families and their children. This is not my reason for declining. I decline on the grounds of the fifth amendment. But this is my position.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you very much.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Mrs. James, do I understand that you wrote Bloomer Girl, or had a part in the writing?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes; and several other people.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you also appear in Bloomer Girl?
Mrs. JAMES. No, sir. I am not an actress. 
Mr. JACKSON. Were you ever a member of Actors' Equity ?
Mrs. JAMES. Yes, I was a member of Actors' Equity when I was a ballet dancer, which was up until 1936, I believe.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you present at a meeting in the Astor at which time Actors' Equity undertook to censure Frank Fay ?
Mrs. JAMES. NO, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. You were not present at that time ?
Mrs. JAMES. No, sir. I was in Hollywood.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no further questions. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter.  1635 
Mr. POTTER. No questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions by counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to ask one further question.
Mr. WOOD. Proceed.
Mr. TAVENNER. The witness has stated that she would not answer the question as to whether or not she was a member of the Communist Party yesterday. But as to this morning she was not a member of the Communist Party. I would like to know whether the appearance of this committee here for the conduct of these hearings had anything to do with that answer of hers. Do you understand what I mean ?
Mrs. JAMES. No; I am afraid that I don't.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whether or not the presence of this committee in the conduct of this investigation has had anything to do with the existence of the facts upon which you have made those answers.
Mr. WIRIN. May I explain to her just the question ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I would rather have her ask me if she doesn't understand the question. Of course, if she wants advice of counsel, that's all right. But if it is a matter of explanation of my question I would rather explain it.
Mr. WIRIN. She apparently wants my advice. May I give it to her? 
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. WIRIN. If I explain the question in the course of it you won't mind too much?
Mr. TAVENNER. I assume it will occur.
Mrs. JAMES (conferring with counsel). The answer to the question is "No."
Mr. TAVENNER. Thank you.
Mr. WOOD. Any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance on the committee ?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO.
Mr. WOOD. It is so ordered.
Mr. TAVENNER. Georgia Backus, Mrs. Georgia Backus Alexander.
Mr. WooD. Are you Mrs. Alexander?
Mrs. ALEXANDER. I am.
Mr. WOOD. Please hold up your right hand and be sworn. You do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mrs. ALEXANDER. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Mrs. Alexander, are you represented by counsel?
Mrs. ALEXANDER. I am so represented.
Mr. WooD. Again, for the record, please, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. KENNY. Robert Kenny and Ben Margolis, Los Angeles. TESTIMONY OF GEORGIA BACKUS ALEXANDER, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS
