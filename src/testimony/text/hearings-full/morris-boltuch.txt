Mr. BOLTUCH. Well, to the best of my recollection, I would say that I had come back to Los Angeles to visit my parents on occasion.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your parents' home was in Los Angeles?
Mr. BOLTUCH. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you engage in the practice of your profession at any time between 1942 and 1944 in Los Angeles? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. As far as I can recall, I don't-I mean, as far as I can remember I don't remember any musical engagements in that period. But I am sure you could check that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you reside in the city of New York at any period other than between 1944 and June 1948 ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. May I ask what the pertinency of this is?
Mr. TAVENNER. You will have to assume that it is pertinent or I wouldn't ask it. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BoLTUCH. My counsel advises me that if it is pertinent you should explain that to me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask the witness be directed to answer the question ?
Mr. MOULDER. What is the question?
Mr. TAVENNER. The question is whether or not the witness lived at any time in the city of New York other than between 1944 and June 1948. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. I really would appreciate your explaining to me the pertinency of this. I have given you these years where I have been. I think I have been quite proper in identifying at this point.
Mr. JACKSoN. Does counsel have a definite purpose in ascertaining this period of time ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. Other than obtaining a complete year-by-year chronology there is a definite purpose ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. 
Mr. JACKSON. Very well. I ask your direction for an answer. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. I would like to know the pertinency of this. If you can state it perhaps you can make me recollect something.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you have any recollection of whether or not you(The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. Please explain the pertinency of this.
Mr. JACKSON. No. I have asked counsel. He states that he has a purpose in asking it. Therefore I ask the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mr. DoYLE. So do I make the same request.
Mr. BOLTUCI. Mr. Chairman, please explain the pertinency. I wasn't given, I wasn't told that I had to bring a whole biographical sketch here. I don't know exactly where I was, exactly. I was traveling.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer if you can recall whether or not you did reside in New York at any other period of time. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3945 (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. The hesitancy of answering on the part of the witness indicates Mr. Tavenner's question is pertinent.
Mr. MARSHALL. What does it indicate, Mr. Scherer? It doesn't indicate anything at all. You don't even know it does.
Mr. JACKSON. Regular order. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Stop fooling around.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Marshall, let's proceed in an orderly fashion. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. You put me in the position where I am forced to decline to answer this question.
Mr. JACKSON. You are not forced to decline.
Mr. BOLTUCH. Until I hear the pertinency of it.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you decline to answer? You are under no compulsion to answer or to refuse to answer. You have a choice which you are going to pursue. But there is no compulsion. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. Mr. Chairman, what is the pertinency of this? Mr. Tavenner says he knows the pertinency. Why can't he tell me this?
Mr. MOULDEr. You have the right to answer the question or to decline to answer the question. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. I say you are directed to answer the question, unless you desire in good faith to decline to answer on the basis of the first or fifth amendment or some other provision of the Constitution or other legal grounds.
Mr. BOLTUCH. Well, it is possible that I was in New York in 1943. I am not absolutely positive about this. It is also possible-I also know that I made a vacation trip to New York. I don't remember what year that was.
Mr. JACKSON. As I recall the question, it was did you reside in New York at any time other than the dates you gave. Did you reside in the sense that you had a residence in New York ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BorLucH. I still would like to hear the pertinency of all this.
Mr. SCHERER. He is doing that now at the direction of his counsel, and his counsel has heardMr. MARSHALL. Of course he is.
Mr. SCHERER. Keep quiet a minute. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Don't shut me up. Don't talk to me that way.
Mr. SCHERER. You keep quiet. You know the rules of this committee.
Mr. MARSHALL. I will take my directions from the chairman. You don't talk to me that way, either.
Mr. JACKSON. Regular order. 
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, I was saying that you have told this witness 4 or 5 times that the pertinency of the question is not involved. You directed him to answer. He has asked you 4 or 5 times at the direction of counsel what pertinency does the question have. We have settled that. Let's move along. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. Let's proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Does the witness refuse to answer? 3946 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I think he has been given every reasonable opportunity to answer.
Mr. BOLTcH. I possibly was in New York, living in New York, in 1943.
Mr. TAVENNER. At any time other than 1943 ?
Mr. BOLTUCH. No. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you reside in 1943 ?
Mr. MARSHALL. Just a minute. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MARSHALL. May we have that last answer read ?
Mr. Chairman, may I have it read?
Mr. MOULDER. Yes. (Whereupon, the record was read by the reporter as follows:) At any time other than 1943? Question. Answer. No. 
Mr. BOLTUCH. I would like to amend that to "so far as I now remember."
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at any time prior to 1944 while in the city of New York ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. As you know, by my identification, I am a musician. That has been my whole life. I have spent my life trying to bring a little joy to people. (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTUCH. If I were to answer this question in the way that you would like to hear me, I would have to go against my religion, whichMr. TAVENNER. We only want the truth.
Mr. BOLTUCH. Which would not allow me to be an informer. I therefore am declining to answer this question on legal grounds, using that amendment which guarantees to the people of this country freedom of speech, thought, association, the first amendment, and on further grounds that amendment in which an innocent man cannot be denied due process of law and be compelled to be a witness against himself, the fifth amendment.
Mr. MOULDER. As I understand it, you use as a reason for declining to answer, the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. BOLTUCH. My previous answer stands.
Mr. MOULDER. You say your religion prevents you from being an informer ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. Did you say religion?
Mr. BOLTUCH. I said religion, the Jewish religion.
Mr. MOULDER. Very well. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. You know when you say that you are making a false statement with regard to the Jewish religion, do you not? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Chairman, we are getting into a very dangerous area with respect to this subject, and I ask the chairman to request counsel to withdraw that question. That is a very dangerous area,. one that this committee has no concern with. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3947
Mr. JACKSON. I ask the chairman to prevent counsel from making speeches in violation of the rules. The committee will judge what areas are dangerous and what areas are not dangerous. 
Mr. MARSHALL. The committee is not the sole judge.
Mr. JACKSON. It requires no enlightenment from you.
Mr. MARSHALL. I think it does from the caliber of that question.
Mr. JACKSON. I am going to ask, Mr. Chairman, and I am going to insist, so long as I sit further as a member of this subcommittee, that at any further outburst, or comment from counsel, he be removed from the committee room. Either counsel comports himself in accordance with the established rules of this committee or he leaves the committee room.
Mr. MOULDER. In accordance with the rules of the committee, the motion as made by Mr. Jackson will of necessity have to be sustained. I sense that there may be a deliberate plot or plan to inject religion into the course of conduct of the hearings. And, as I say, it has no place in this proceeding. But let's proceed from here, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. MARSHALL. IS the question withdrawn ?
Mr. MOULDER. Let's proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you remove your hand so that the gentleman may answer the question ?
Mr. MARSHALL. Ma.y I reply to Mr. Tavenner orMr. JACKSON. No. 
Mr. MOULDER. As stated by Mr. Jackson you are well aware of the rules of this committee. It does not permit counsel to address the committee or to engage in arguments with any member of the committe or with counsel. You have the right to advise and consult with your client, advise him on questions of law arising in connection with the questions that might be propounded to him. Otherwise, of course, it is not an ordinary procedure and you are well aware of that.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Chairman, may I read rule VII, which Counsel Marshall is well aware of: The participation of counsel during the course of any hearing and while the witness is testifying shall be limited to advising said witness as to his legal rights. Counsel shall not be permitted to engage in oral argument with the committee, but shall confine his activity to the area of legal advice to his client. 
Mr. JACKsoN. Mr. Chairman, before counsel proceeds, lest we do become involved in some argument or debate which is foisted upon the committee, I would request that this area be no further explored in questioning. It is not in the proper province of the committee, and I am confident that had it not been brought up by a witness, it would not have been mentioned during the course of this hearing.
Mr. DOTLE. That is correct, certainly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee, please, whether you had a Communist Party membership transferred from the city of New York to Los Angeles ? (The witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. BOLTCH. Would you repeat the question, please ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have your Communist Party membership transferred from the city of New York to Los Angeles ?
Mr. BOLTUCH. This is the same type of question you asked before, and I am going to decline for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you affiliate with the musicians branch of the Communist Party in Los Angeles ? 3948 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. BOLTUCH. The same question, the same answer, the same legal grounds.
Mr. MOULDER. IS that the first and fifth amendments you are claiming ?
Mr. BOLTUCH. I think the record will show exactly what it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. BOLTUCH. I refuse to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Scherer, do you have any questions?
Mr. SCHERER. No.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is excused. Call your next witness, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Philip Goldberg.
Mr. MOULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
Mr. GOLDBERG. I do.
Mr. MOULDER. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner. TESTIMONY OF PHILIP GOLDBERG, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, RICHARD L. RYKOFF
