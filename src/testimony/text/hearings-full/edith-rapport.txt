Mrs. RAPPORT. I will have to wait until my attorney is seated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your attorney is now seated. Will you please state your name?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Edith Rapport. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell your last name, please ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. How do you have it spelled ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask that the witness be directed to answer the question ?
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. It is a waste of time and duplication. However, I will spell it-R-a-p-p-o-r-t.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Moulder, may I address you, please? I am going to inquire, is any recording being made of these proceedings other than the stenographic reporting of the hearing?
Mr.' MOULDER. The committee has no knowledge of any recordings being made of the proceedings.
Mr. MARSHALL. In other words, no tape recording is being made of this hearing. Is that correct ?
Mr. MOULDER. That is correct. Please proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel who just addressed the chairman please identify himself for the record.
Mr. MARSHALL. Daniel G. Marshall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you appearing with the witness?
Mr. MARSHALL. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mrs. Rapport?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I was born December 18, and I would rather not tell my age.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask that the witness be directed to give the date of her birth.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. In reading some of the other testimony I notice that you gave the actresses or people in the acting profession preferences as to answering their age or telling their age, and I, being a professional person, would rather not disclose my age.
Mr. MOULDER. The Chair will speak for the committee, in stating that the purpose of directing you to answer the question is to inform COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS-ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3677 you of the dangers which you might be confronted with in connection with being in contempt of Congress, and, in so advising you and directing you to answer the question, it is not in the nature of or spirit of a threat, but for your own interest in order to protect you from such future proceedings in the nature of contempt. Therefore, the committee directs you to answer the question. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Very well, December 18, 1912.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Minsk, Russia.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you come to this country? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I really don't quite remember the date, but I would say approximately 1923 or 1924.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a naturalized American citizen? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I am a citizen by derivation.
Mr. TAVENNER. Through your mother or your father? 
Mrs. RAPPORT. Through my father.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your father's name? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Would you like to drag my father into this, too? You find that it is necessary to drag my entire family into this hearing
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer. I can see in no manner how that would be a reflection upon your father for you to admit that you are his daughter.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I think anyone who is mentioned by the committee is enough to drag him through the mud.
Mr. JACKSON. As a matter of proper identification, I ask that the witness be directed to answer.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I think I am identified sufficiently.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed- 
Mrs. RAPPORT. I assure you that I am the person who has been subpenaed. My name is Edith Rapport. I received your subpena, and I am here.
Mr. SCHERER. I think we have a right to determine whether this person is a naturalized citizen by derivation. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. SCHERER. The question, therefore, as to her father's name, is perfectly proper to determine whether or not the citizenship as she indicated is correct.
Mr. MOULDER. For the reasons stated by Mr. Jackson and by Mr. Scherer, you are directed to answer the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. All right. My father's name is Max Rubin.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where was he naturalized? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I do not know the exact date, Mr. Tavenner. I think it is in approximately 1927, in New York City.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you living in New York City at that time?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; I was. 3678 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you come to California to reside?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I was in California twice. Which time are you referring to
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us begin with the first time. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. The first time, approximately 1930 or 1929. tell you the exact year. I can't 
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you live in California at that time?
Mrs. RAPPORT. You are making me go back an awfully long time. I don't have that recollection. I believe just a couple of years, approximately.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you married at the time you came to California in 1929 or 1930 ? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; I was married.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your husband's name is George Rapport? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Are you familiar with the rules of procedure that you sent me? I think this was sent to me by Mr. Wheeler's office, representing this committee. I was asked a question. Will you permit me to finish this question ?
Mr. SCmERER. Mr. Chairman, it is obvious that Mr. Tavenner is not asking her to testify against her husband. He wants to know the identity of her husband. I ask that the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. What was the question ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Obviously you can't seem to get together on this, can you ?
Mr. MOULDER. We are trying to be very respectful. We will be respectful to you as a witness.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Thank you very kindly.
Mr. MOULDER. I merely asked a question. Because of the sound effects I couldn't understand what it was. Please repeat the question, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. I asked her if her husband's name was George Rapport.
Mr. SCHERER. A perfectly proper question for the purpose of identification. Certainly it is not violating the rules of the committee.
Mrs. RAPPORT. May I read this little Rules of Procedure, this little booklet, as to how a witness should behave? I quote: The confidential relationship between husband and wife shall be respected, and, for reasons of public policy, one spouse shall not be questioned concerning the activities of the other. 
Mr. MOULDER. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. There is nothing confidential about one's marriage. May I ask she be directed to answer the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will refuse to answer this question on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. JACKSON. I ask that a direction be given to the witness to answer as a matter of identification.
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, the witness is directed to answer the question for the reason given by Mr. Jackson. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3679 (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. What was the question, please?
Mr. TAVENNER. Read the question. (Whereupon, the reporter read from his notes, as follows:) Your husband's name is George Rapport?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was your name Edith Rapport at the time you came to California in 1929 or 1930 ? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated that you lived here about 2 years at that time?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I said approximately. I don't quite remember the date.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you return to New York from California ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the end of that period ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you return to California from New York? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I don't have the recollection as to when I returned. I would say approximately between the period of 1934 and 1936, somewhere between there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Somewhere between 1934 and 1936 ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you live on your return to California in 1934 or 1936 ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. How do you expect me to remember that ?
Mr. SCHERER. If you do not remember, just say you do not remember.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I don't remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you reside now ? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will be very happy to write my address.
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, counsel has asked the witness where she resides now. I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question. He did not ask the witness to write her address.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Will you tell me what the pertinency of that is? I think that you have me identified pretty well. I have been served with a subpena at my home, and you have my address right in front of you. And I feel that the reason I would like toMr. MOULDER. You are so directed, as requested by Mr. Scherer.
Mrs. RAPPORT. 3782 Tracy.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you resided there ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. A year and a half.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many places have you resided since 1934 or 1936, whichever is the proper date of your return to California? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I would like to know what was the purpose of this committee in inviting me at this point, with the threat of arrest unless I appeared. To question me as to where I live and what State I resided? How I traveled? When and where and why? 3680 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
Mr. SCHERER. Mr. Chairman, I ask that you direct the witness to answer the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I claim the privileges under the fifth-the first supplemented by the fifth amendment.
Mr. MOULDER. May I first ask counsel to give us a short explanation of the purpose of that question, as to how many places the witness has resided since the date of her last return and establishment of residence in California.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will be more specific with the witness. Did you reside at 27061/2 Boulder Street on June 9, 1938? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will refuse to answer that question on the basis of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth, of which I am very proud and for which I will fight and protect.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you reside at 527 North Cummings, Los Angeles, on the 13th day of September, 1940 ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will give you the same answer, Mr. Tavenner, and claim the privilege of the fitst amendment supplemented by the fifth, which I will fight to protect.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness need not make any comment in that respect. You refuse to answer for the reason just given.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Yes; I do.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with a person by the name of Irene Stark? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will decline to answer that on the same grounds as stated before.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever used the name "Irene Stark"?
Mr. RAPPORT. I will decline to answer that on the same grounds, the first and the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you given the name Irene Stark as a Communist Party name ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Aren't you getting a little bit sick and tired of asking the same questions ? I decline to answer this question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was your name changed within the Communist Party on April 23, 1935, from Edith Rubln to Irene Stark? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds, the first and fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a Communist Party membership book No. 73,561, showing the 1937 membership for an individual by the name of Irene Stark, and as having been issued on December 17, 1936, and signed by William Schneiderman. Will you examine it, please, and state whether or not that was your Communist Party book? (Document handed to counsel for the witness.)
Mr. MARSHALL. IS there a question pending now ?
Mr. MOULDER. Please repeat the question, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will the reporter read it, please. (The reporter read from his notes as requested.) (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will decline to answer that question. As a matter of fact, my attorney will not even permit me to look at it. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3681 
Mr. SCHERER. I ask that the witness be ordered to examine the book as directed by counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. I return the document to the witness and ask her to examine it, and state whether she had ever seen it before. (Document again handed to counsel for the witness.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Is this a new question
Mr. TAVENNER. You are not examining the document.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I don't know which questionMr. MOULDER. The question is asking the witness to examine the book, and state whether or not she had even seen it before?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. There was another question preceding that which
Mr. Scherer requested.
Mr. SCHERER. That was the question that I asked she be directed to answer; namely, she never looked at the book during the time sheMr. MOULDER. There is a considerable difference between the two questions in that respect. I believe you should define them.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will withdraw my question.
Mr. MOULDER. We will say that this last question is the one now pending.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I am sorry. Which question was withdrawn?
Mr. MOULDER. You are now requested, in the nature of a question, to examine the document which counsel has referred to as a Communist Party book.
Mrs. RAPPORT. That isn't a question, is it? This is a request or demand.
Mr. MOULDER. It is being handed to you as an exhibit, giving you an opportunity to examine it. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Thank you very much, but I don't want the opportunity to examine it.
Mr. MOULDER. What are your reasons for refusing ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I am simply not interested. I think it has nothing to do with what I was called here for. I am a musicianMr. MOULDER. It has everything in the world to do with what you are called here for. We ask you to examine the exhibit.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Are you asking me or are you demanding me to examine this?
Mr. MOULDER. We direct you to examine the exhibit which has been handed to you for your examination. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. That is in order that you might have a fair opportunity to qualify in making a response to the next question which will be propounded to you. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I won't answer any of these questions that have followed this and respecting this document. I still claim the privilege under the first and fifth amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. SCHERER. May I make this observation, because what happened will not be shown by the record: Counsel for the witness took the exhibit from the hand of our investigator, and has failed and refused to present it to the witness. In my opinion, he is guilty of contempt. 3682 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. MorLDER. Let us proceed.
Mr. MARSHALL. I object to that as an interference with my right to counsel this witness. I am waiting for any lawful order of this committee.
Mr. MOULDER. May I have it? Or will you please hand the Communist Party book to our investigator Mr. Wheeler?
Mr. MARSHALL. Let the record show that I have handed back to Mr. Wheeler the same document which Mr. Wheeler handed to me.
Mr. MOULDER. Very well, Mr. Marshall. Now will the investigator, Mr. Wheeler hand this 1937 Communist Party membership book which was referred to by counsel over to the witness for the purpose of giving her an opportunity to examine it in order that she might qualify to respond to the next question which will be propounded by counsel.
Mr. SCHERER. Let the record show that counsel prevented his client from accepting the book, took the book in his own hand and threw it back on the table. I want the record to show that, and, in my opinion, counsel is guilty of contempt.
Mr. MARSHALL. Let the record show that no document will be handed to my client unless it is handed to me first.
Mr. SCHERER. Let the record also show that on two previous occasions this document was handed to counsel and he refused to hand it to his client.
Mr. MARSHALL. Then I returned it to Mr. Wheeler because the chairman told me to return it.
Mr. JACKSON. Regular order, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MOULDER. Let the record show that the witness refuses to accept the document which has been referred to by our counsel as a Communist Party membership book for examination in order to respond to the next question that will be propounded.
Mr. JACKSON. The record should show the witness has taken the book.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Moulder, you have handed us a document, but, by accepting it, we don't want to vouch for the description you gave it.
Mr. MoULDER. We understand that. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you open the book and examine it. Will you permit the witness to examine the contents of the book,
Mr. Counsel?
Mr. SCHERER. The record should show that the counsel took the book from the witness before she opened it, and that the witnessMr. MOULDER. Now the witness is examining the book. We will have order in the hearing room, please. Let us proceed.
Mr. MARSHALL. I didn't want the record to show the witness has examined the book. The document was handed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now that you have finally examined the book, will you tell the committee whether you have ever seen it before?
Mrs. RAPPORT. After all this game back and forth that you seem to be enjoying playing, I will decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated, the first and supplemented by the fifth amendment. COMTVUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3683 
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I desire to introduce the document in evidence, ask permission of the committee to have a photostatic copy of it made, using that copy in evidence in lieu of the original and that the document be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 1 ?"
Mr. MOULDER. Hearing no objection on the part of any member of the committee, without objection the document referred to by counsel is received and will be marked as "Rapport Exhibit No. 1" It will be admitted in evidence with the understanding that the exhibit can be withdrawn after a photostatic copy has been made and offered in evidence in lieu of the original.

Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to introduce this second Communist Party membership book in evidence, to be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 2," with the privilege, as in the other case, of substituting a photostatic copy.
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask counsel to identify at this point, the William Schneiderman who signed these two books you have identified as Communist Party membership books.
Mr. TAVENNER. William Schneiderman was secretary of the Communist Party for the State of California.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. I now hand you a receipt card, No. 58,571, bearing date of December 9-but the year is not complete-with a signature on it. (Document handed to counsel for the witness.)

Mrs. RAPPORT. I have no interest in looking at it because the answer is going to be exactly the same as it was. If you keep me here for the next month I will not cooperate with this committee, and I will invoke the same constitutional amendments, Nos. 1 and 5.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, may I make an observation? Without examining the card, how do you know it is not a receipt for a contribution to the Red Cross?
Mrs. RAPPORT. If you were listening, Mr. Jackson, you would hear that Mr. Tavenner described this document. 
Mr. JACKSON. He said there was a signature on there. I am not absolutely certain what it was.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Apparently you are not listening.
Mr. MARSHALL. Let's have the record read.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Will you read the record, please.
Mr. JACKSON. You make it difficult to get any coherent, intelligent idea of what is going on. 
Mr. MARSHAIL. She is very intelligent about it. You missed the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. You make it very difficult by asking me to appear here.
Mr. JACKSON. Counsel knows the prerogatives before this committee, and his sole prerogative is to advise his client.
Mr. MARSHALL. That I intend to do.
Mr. JACKSON. That you are going to do, or you are not going to be sitting there very long.
Mrs. RAPPORT. You are not going to threaten me.
Mr. JACKSON. You will sit there as long as you comport yourself in accordance with the rules of this committee, with which rules you are very familiar from prior representation before the committee.
Mr. MARSHALL. And I intend to advise my client.
Mr. JACKSON. Confine your remarks, Mr. Marshall, to your client.
Mr. MARSHALL. You are confused. Lawyers aren't here as a matter of grace; they are here as a matter of right.
Mr. JACKSON. Whatever rights you have here are clearly set forth in the rules of procedure.
Mr. MARSHALL. They are rights; they are not courtesies and privileges of this committee.
Mr. JACKSON. You are here to advise your client; not to carry on any debate with the committee. You know that perfectly well.
Mr. MOULDER. Let's proceed with the hearing. I wish to say, of course, we realize you are not cooperating with the committee. We are going to have every respect for your ap- pearance here. But, in all fairness to yourself and the committee, you should not refuse to look at the exhibit offered to you and to deny or affirm whether or not it is your signature. That is for the protection of your best interests to do so. 
Mrs. RAPPORT. You have not protected my interests by calling me here, by dragging me down here and interfering with my musical profession and with my life. You haven't cooperated with me. And I don't intend to cooperate with you, and I will stand on the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. MoULDER. First, you haven't seen the exhibit. I will insist that you accept the exhibit and look at it.
Mrs. RAPPORT. All right, I will look at it. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3687 
Mr. MOULDE. After having examined the exhibit, may I ask counsel to repeat the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. You needn't bother. I will not answer that question, and I will stand on the privileges granted to me by the first and fifth amendments of the United States Constitution.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, that you have finished, let me ask you the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. You asked me the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that your signature appearing on the card?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I will refuse to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Why ? 
Mrs. RAPPORT. On the grounds previously stated, and I do not have to go into any kind of explanations to you.
Mr. MOULDER. You say on the grounds previously stated. You have stated so many grounds, some of them on the constitutional basis.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I desire to introduce in evidence the receipt card No. 58,571 and ask that it be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 3."
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mrs. RAPPORT. The first amendment supplemented by the fifth amendment to the Constitution.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have just stated, a moment ago, that you were a member of the musical profession.

Mrs. RAPPORT. What is the pertinency of that question; may I ask?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question. Certainly it would have no tendency to incriminate you to answer the question as to whether or not you were a member of the musicians union.
Mr. MARSHALL. The musicians union ?
Mr. MOULDER. That is the way I understood it. Counsel, is that the question ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I didn't ask about the musicians union.
Mr. MOULDER. I understood you to say that.
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir. My question was whether or not she was a member of the musical profession from the time she returned here in 1934 or 1936.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I hesitate to answer that question because I know very well what will follow. You are trying to drag and interfere with the life of our union, and, therefore, I am simply not interested in answering that question. According to this morning's paper-and I would like toMr. TAVENNER. The witness volunteered the information that she was a member of the musical profession. I have merely asked her whether she was a member of that profession in 1934 or 1936. If she ever had any reason for not answering it she has waived it, and I ask that she be directed to answer it. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer the question. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. What year was that?
Mr. TAVENNER. 1934 or 1936 when you said you returned from the city of New York to California.
Mrs. RAPPORT. No; I don't believe I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you begin your professional musical career in California? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Approximately 1947 or 1948 or 1949 or thereabouts.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of an affidavit of registration, bearing date the 18th day of March 1936, and ask you to examine it. (Document handed to counsel for the witness.) (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. My counsel advises me not to examine this document that was handed to him.
Mr. MOULDER. You are directed to examine the document referred to by counsel which has been presented to you.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Excuse me. I want to put my glasses on. I can't see.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness has examined the document.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee, please, whether or not that is an affidavit of registration signed by you ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I don't have any assurance that this may not be a phony document, and, therefore, I will refuse to identify it or answer COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3689 your question on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. If that is her reason for refusing to answer, Mr. Chairman, it certainly could not be a valid reason, and I request that the witness be directed to answer the question.
Mr. MOULDER. It certainly isn't responsive to the question when you identify it as a phony. Therefore, the witness is directed to answer the question. lMrs.RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to introduce the document affidavit of registration dated March 18, 1936 in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 4." (This exhibit is similar to Waddilove exhibit No. 7, p. 3664, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, the request of counsel is granted. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I call attention to the fact that this affidavit of registration shows on its face that it was canceled on June 9, 1938. I now hand the witness a second affidavit of registration bearing date of June 9, 1938, and I will ask the witness to examine it and see whether or not the signature appearing there is her signature, and whether it is her affidavit of registration. (Document handed to counsel for the witness.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. My counsel advises me not to examine this document. 
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to examine the document in order to respond to the question. The record will show that the witness is now examining the document with counsel. Now would you repeat the question, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. My question is, that after the witness has examined it, whether or not the signature appearing there is her signature and whether it is her affidavit of registration.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds, the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I have it, please.
Mr. CHAIRMAN. I desire to introduce the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 5." (This exhibit is similar to Waddilove exhibit No. 1, p. 3664, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committee's records.)
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, exhibit No. 5 shows that it is a Communist Party registration, the name of the person is Edith Rapport, her father's name is Max Rubin, and that it was canceled on September 24,1942. I now hand the witness a photostatic copy of a document which the staff, in the course of its investigation, has procured. The document is over the signature of Celeste Strack and is entitled "Communist Party Appointment of Members of the State Central Committee Meeting at Sacramento in the Year 1940." Will you exhibit the document, please, to the witness? 3690 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA (Document handed to counsel for the witness.) (Witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Will the witness please examine the document and state whether or not she observes on it the signature of Miss Celeste Strack?
Mrs. RAPPORT. How many questions do you have pending and what are they?
Mr. TAVENNER. I think you know very well; but if you desire to have it repeated, I will. Will you examine the document and state whether or not you recognize the signature of Miss Strack to that document? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. On the advice of my counsel, I refuse to answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you examine the document again, please, and state whether or not your name appears as the second name in a group of three names ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Just a minute. I haven't examined the document.
Mr. JACKSON. I ask that the witness be directed, as a basis for succeeding questions, to examine the document.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is so directed. But may I suggest the proper procedure would be to hand the witness a document marked "Exhibit So-and-so." Then ask her to examine it, without reference to any of the contents in the instrument which might give her some cause or basis for claiming the fifth amendment. If she refuses to examine the exhibit, she will be directed to examine it, and we will then proceed with the questioning. Then we might have some basis for contempt. But I think when you couple the request for examination with the naming of certain people, there might be some cause for her to refuse to answer on those grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I thought counsel had shown her the document.
Mr. JACKSON. I press my request for direction of the witness to examine the document.
Mr. MOULDER. May I have the document ? (Document handed to the chairman.)
Mr. MOULDER. What is the last exhibit number ?
Mr. TAVENNER. The last one was 5. This would be 6.
Mr. MOULDER. We ask the witness to examine this document marked for identification purposes as "Rapport Exhibit No. 6." (Document handed to counsel for the witness.)
Mr. MARSHALL. It has no marking on it.
Mr. MOULDER. Have the exhibit marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 6." (The document referred to was marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 6" for identification.)
Mr. MOULDER. Now that the document is marked-"Rapport Exhibit No. 6," the witness is requested to examine that exhibit. (The witness confers with her counsel.) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3691 
Mrs. RAPPORT. On the advice of my counsel, I refuse to examine this document, on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. JACKSON. I ask the witness be directed to examine it.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to examine the document marked "Exhibit No. 6." The record will now reveal that the witness, in conference with counsel, is examining exhibit No. 6 which has been handed to her. Will you ask the next question concerning exhibit No. 6, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. Keep the document there. On further examination of the document, do you see your name appearing in the second of a group of three names, about the middle of the document? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now I would like to have the document, please.
Mr. MOULDER. It was marked as an exhibit and then offered to the witness.
Mr. TAVENNER. I now desire to offer in evidence this document previously identified as "Rapport exhibit No. 6," to be retained in the files of the committee.
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I think I should read this document into the record. Communist Party appointment of members of the State central committee meeting at Sacramento in the year 1940. I, Celeste Strack, duly qualified as a delegate to the State convention at Sacramento in the year 1940, by virtue of my nomination to the office of Congress, 13th District, on the 27th day of August 1940, upon the Communist ticket, do hereby appoint the following three voters who shall be members of the State central committee to meet at Sacramento, September 20, 1940, to wit: George Rapport, 527 North Cummings, Los Angeles, Mrs. Edith Rapport, 527 North Cummings, Los Angeles, Louis Baron, 9311/ South Mathews, Los Angeles. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 13th day of September 1940.
Miss CELESTE STACK. Did you attend, Mrs. Rapport, the State convention of the Communist Party in the year 1940 ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. You know very well I am going to refuse to answer that question, and I do so on the ground of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. I now hand you a photostatic copy of a document which the staff procured in the course of its investigation, which purports to be a proxy signed by you. It is marked for identification as "Rapport Exhibit No. 7." (Document handed to counsel for the witness.)
Mr. TAVENNER. After your examination I will ask you a question. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. On the advice of my counsel, I refuse to examine this document, on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth. 3692 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to examine the document marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 7." The record should show at this point that the witness and counsel are carefully examining the document marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 7."
Mr. MARSHALL. Did you say carefully?
Mr. MOULDER. We have no need for any comment on that, Mr. Marshall. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you examine the document carefully enough to see whether or not your name is signed to it?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then will you look at it carefully enough so that you will be qualified to answer my question. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer for the reasons previously stated, on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to examine exhibit No. 7. (The witness confers with her counsel, examining document.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. Under your order, I have looked at it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is the signature appearing there your signature?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I refuse to answer that question on the ground of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer the document in evidence, ask that it be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 7," and made a part of the printed record.
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, Rapport exhibit No. 7, is admitted in evidence.
Mr. MARSHALL. You mean without objection from us. We have objections. Would you like to hear them?
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection from any member of the committee, Rapport exhibit No. 7 is admitted into evidence.
Mr. JACKsoN. I ask that counsel for the witness be directed to confine his activities in this hearing room to advice to his client; not to the committee.
Mr. MOULDER. That is a rule of the committee, of course. The witness has an opportunity to confer with counsel and be accompanied by counsel, without any right or privilege of making remarks or argument to members of the committee. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I understood you to tell us earlier in your testimony that you began your professional career in music in 1947, or 1937. (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. I am not quite clear about that, Mr. Tavenner, and I would like to have the record read to refresh my memory.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't think that will be necessary.
Mrs. RAPPORT. What the questions were and what the answers were. I don't know whether you are repeating the same questions or trying to get me involved or what?
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand perfectly what you mean. It is not necessary to look at the record.
Mrs. RAPPORT. I don't understand what you mean, and you have asked me a question. And there is a difference. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3693 RAPPORT EXHIBIT No. 7 COMMUNIST PARTY Proxy for Attendance at the State Central Committee Meeting at Sacramento, in the Year 1940 r, -f.r Ac k.4 ic J-1. , duly qualified to sicas a member of the State Central Committee meeting at Sacramento in the year 1940 (September 20, 1940), by virtue of (being delegate r the StateConvenion) (my appointment theretoby _Ce eJ-.A- - .. .__.; thisappointment havingbeenduly filedin the officeof the Secretaryof State on the-..l.ot._ part inapplicable)doherebydesignate (pone-offienaddren) - ______ n... v ..b day of....._-S .t ..-_1940) (Strikeout v.t-L . ._'r-r.._ ___ _. . 12/or 1A I/I'g 77 - t nt Sap ec as my proxy with full power to act for me in every respect a a duly qualified member of the State Central Committee meeting at Sacramento on the 20th day of September, 1940.

Mrs. RArroRT. But I don't understand perfectly.
Mr. TAVENNER. That isn't necessary because there is no question pending.
Mr. JACKsON. May I make an observation. If the fact that Communist Party membership has ever been established before the committee, it has been established here. It is quite obvious that there is going to be no comment, continued refusal to identify documents, signatures and everything else of the sort. Unless there is some particular reason to continue with the witness, I would suggest-we have 50Mr. TAVENNER. I do have a particular reason.
Mr. JACKSON. Very well.
Mr. MARSHALL. You are not finished?
Mr. TAVENNER. Now in 1948 were you engaged in the practice of your musical profession? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. If I remember correctly, I gave you no exact dates, no specific dates. I said approximately.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you answer the question. Were you engaged in the practice of the musical profession in 1948? 3694 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. RAPPORT. I told you I don't remember exactly whether it was 1948 or 1949 or 1947 and 1950. I said approximately. I say the same thing now; approximately.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am not asking what you told me. Tell me now were you practicing your musical profession in 1948 ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. You have asked me that question before.
Mr. MOULDER. The witness is directed to answer. You should know whether or not you were engaged in the practice of your profession in 1948. That is a very simple question. (The witness confers withher counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. So far as I remember, I am not too certain about the exact year, but I may have practiced my profession in 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the musicians branch of the Communist Party in 1948 ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. Again you know that I am going to decline to answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth. And this is beginning to sound like a broken record.
Mr. MOULDER. We want to give you the opportunity to respond to the question.
Mrs. RAPPORT. Thank you very kindly for the opportunity, but I do not appreciate it.
Mr. JACKSON. That is no answer to the question. She said we know she is going to decline. We know it very well. But do you so decline?
Mrs. RAProRT. I do so decline, Mr. Jackson on the grounds of the first amendment supplemented by the fifth. If you care to, I will read it to you just to refresh your memory.
Mr. MoULDER. Proceed with the next question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you requested by the Communist Party to circulate a petition in 1948 to put the Independent Progressive Party on the ballot in the State of California ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds, the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a petition which, at the end of it, has an affidavit. I will have this petition marked for identification as "Rapport Exhibit No. 8."
Mr. MOULDER. Have it so marked. (The document referred to was marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 8" for identification.) (Document handed to counsel for the witness.) (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. On the advice of my counsel, I will decline to examine this document, on the first amendment supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. MOULDER. The committee respectfully directs the witness to examine the exhibit handed to her, marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 8."
Mrs. RAPPORT [after examining document]. I have looked at the document.
Mr. MOULDER. Have you examined the document?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I have looked at it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you circulate that petition? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 3695 
Mrs. RAPPORT. I decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated, the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I offer the document in evidence, and ask that it be marked "Rapport Exhibit No. 8." (This exhibit is similar to Waddilove exhibit No. 3, p. 3667, and will not be reproduced in the printed record. It is on file in the committe's records.) 
Mr. MOULDER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (Representative Donald L. Jackson left the hearing room at this point.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you take an oath before a notary public that you did circulate this petition? (The witness confers with her counsel.)
Mrs. RAPPORT. The same question, and I will give you the same answer, on the grounds of the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. RAPPORT. I am going to decline to answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment, supplemented by the fifth. I would suggest that the committee investigate the unwarranted attack on a fellow artist by the name of Nat King Cole in the South.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mrs. RAPPORT. You are not interested in these things, obviously.
Mr MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER. Any questions, Mr. Scherer.
Mr. SCHERER. No questions.
Mr. MOULDER We will stand in recess until 1: 30. (Whereupon, at 12:15 p. m., the committee was recessed, to reconvene at 1: 30 p. m., the same day.) AFTERNOON SESSION, MONDAY, APRIL 16, 1956 (The committee was reconvened at 1:45 p. m., upon the expiration of the recess. Representatives Moulder, Doyle, Jackson, and Scherer being present.)
Mr. MOULDER. The committee will come to order. Will you call the next witness, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Rubin Decker. Will you come forward, please?
Mr. MoULDER. Hold up your right hand and be sworn, please. Do you solemnly swear the testimony which you are about to give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. DECKER. I do. TESTIMONY OF RUBIN DECKER, ACCOMPANIED BY COUNSEL, MORTIMER VOGEL
