Mr. BLowITz. William Frank Blowitz.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Blowitz? 
Mr. BLowrrz. Kansas City, Mo., July 1915.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I suggest that you. talk as if you were talkingto me and then the microphones .willdo the rest. Where do you nowreside ?
Mr. BLOWITZ. Van Nuys, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. How-long have you lived in California?
Mr. BLOWITZ. 16 years.  1697 
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your occupation?
Mr. BLOWITZ. I am a publicist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe a little more the nature of your work?
Mr. BLOWITZ. I am a man who is hired by corporations, motion- picture companies, to publicize their products through newspapers, magazines, radio, or any other media available.
Mr. TAVENNER. How much of the period of time since you have been in California have you been employed in the motion-picture industry
Mr. BLowITZ. In a cumulative sense, the bulk of the time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee briefly a statement of your educational background?
Mr. BIOWITz. I was educated in the public schools of Missouri, Illinois, and Pennsylvania; graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1935.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Blowitz, at the close of the session yesterday, 
Mr. Martin Berkeley appeared in an executive session of the committee and in the course of his testimony there he named you as a former member of the Communist Party in this area. I would like you to tell the committee whether or not that testimony was correct.
Mr. BLowrrz. Yes, it was. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When and over what period of time have you been a member of the Communist Party ? 
Mr. BLOwITZ. I was a member of what was called the Communist Political Association from the spring of 1944 until that organization was dissolved, and then briefly I attended Communist Party meetings. To the best of my knowledge I have no card and had no card. The fact that I attended the meeting and paid whatever small dues that was involved was sufficient for me.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long a period of time did you remain in the party?
Mr. BLOWITZ. Approximately 15 months.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under which you became recruited as a member of the Communist Party ? 
Mr. BLOWITZ. Well, briefly, I was invited to what was an open forum discussion at the home of John Lawson, who lived just a few blocks from me, and whom I had met. I went to this meeting and several others of the same nature, and then accepted participation and membership in the Communist Political Association, which was at that time, as you know, an open political party with open meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who invited you to become a member of the party?
Mr. BLOWITZ. John Lawson.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee names of others who were members of the party along with you?
Mr. BLOWITZ. Well, this is, as you know, extraordinarily difficult I can name a few people who themselves told me that they were members, or some spoke to me as to indicate mutual membership. There was, as I said, a considerable floating population, some of whom I met and some of whom I did not, and some of whom I know and some of whom I knew, and some of whom I no longer know. (Representative Donald L. Jackson returned to the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, I want you to confine yourself to evidence within your own knowledge. 1698  
Mr. BLOWITZ. To the very best of my knowledge at that time Mr. and Mis. Lawson were also members, Mr. and Mrs. Lester Cole, Alvah Bessie, a Morton Grant. There were a couple of others. As we go through it and you mention their names it is conceivable that I will recall them and I will if I can.
Mr. TAENNER. Did you attend a Communist Party meeting in the home of Mortimer Offner?
Mr. BLOWITZ. No, I don't know the name. I attended meetings in several homes that were completely strange to me. ' Mr.'TAVENNER. What were the circumstances under which you ter- minated your relationship with the party?
Mr. BLowrrz. It was a matter of a difference of opinion on my part, certainly, during the course of the Hollywood strike in 1945. I at-tended a meeting at the home of a trade-union member, whose name I do not know. There were two meetings during this period, shortly after the strike started, and I attended two meetings at the home of a Hollywood labor leader. At the second meeting a woman by the name of Elizabeth Leech and a man named John Stapp, S-t-a-p-p, came out and in the course of the discussion I was in considerable disagreement as to the Hollywood strike of 1945, as the result of which I felt my interests were no longer allied with the party and I stopped.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you know those persons, Elizabeth Leech and John Stapp, to be functionaries in the Communist Party?
Mr. BLOWITZ. I had not-I do not know them other than as of that meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was this a fraction meeting of the Communist Party which you were attending?
Mr. BLowrrz. That is conceivable. I attended, I would say, a total of no more than 12 or 14 meetings during my entire period. And it is conceivable it was a fraction meeting. I have just recently had that defined for me since the course of the hearings.
Mr. TAVENNER. What part did Elizabeth Leech and John Stapp, the functionaries of the Communist Party, play in this strike dispute or argument which you have mentioned, or conference?
Mr. BLOwrTz. I don't recall the exact circumstances, but' I felt that it was a correct strike and one that should be won by the ordinary methods of labor union, which you understand what the ordinary methods of labor unions are in winning a strike. I don't recall what point they took, I don't recall what point I took, except this was the second meeting that this had occurred and I felt that I wanted to go my own way. I do recall that the party was opposed to Herb Sorrell all through this period.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter?
Mr. WALTER. NO questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYi. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter?
Mr. POTTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Is there any reason why the witness shouldn't be excused from further attendance?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.  1699 
Mr. WooD. It is so ordered. Is that all? 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no other witnesses that we could complete in anywhere near the time that you mentioned. adjourn. If you will just wait one moment. I think I can call another witness. I suggest that we 
Mr. WooD. Who do you call?
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss Herta Uerkvitz.
Mr. WooD. Will you raise your right hand and be sworn. You do solemnly swear that the evidence you shall give this subcommittee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Miss UERKVITZ. I do. TESTIMONY OF HERTA UERKVITZ, ACCOMPANIED BY HER COUNSEL, ROBERT W. KENNY
