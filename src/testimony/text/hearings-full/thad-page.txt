Mr. PAGE. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe you are a representative from the National Archives staff?
Mr. PAGE. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. A subpena duces tecum has been issued for the production of a document in the custody of your department. You are now responding to that subpena, are you ?
Mr. PAGE. That is right, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have the document with you?
Mr. PAGE. I do, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you let me see it?
Mr. PAGE (producing folder). It is the white document in that folder.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, this is Form 57 purportedly signed by Mr. Leonardo Bercovici. I do not want to introduce this in evi- dence, but the witness will have to take it back unless we have a photo- static copy made at once. I think, if we just let him present it, that will be satisfactory for our purposes, and I.can return it to him in a few minutes. I was not going to introduce it as an exhibit.
Mr. WooD. Do you want to have it photostated ?
Mr. TAVENNER. If the chairman thinks we should, we will have it photostated, but we will have to get it back at once. 
Mr. PAGE. Mr. Tavenner, we could, within an hour or so, provide you with a photostatic copy. 472 INDUSTRY 
Mr. WOOD. I was just going to ask if you had facilities to do that.
Mr. PAGE. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVEENNER. Will you examine the document and state exactly what it is?
Mr. PAGE. This is a folder from the Office of War Information that was transferred to the National Archives, and the folder is labeled "Mr. Leonardo Bercovici"-if that is the proper pronunciation-and among the documents in the folder is Standard Government Form No. 57, purportedly signed by Mr. Bercovici, in which he sets forth various information called for in connection with an application for employment by the Office of War Information.
Mr. TAVEN1ER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Any questions, gentlemen ? 
Mr. DOYE. Well, may I ask this: How long has that folder been in your possession in the Archives?
Mr. PAGE. I can't give you the exact date, Mr. Doyle. The records are not under my immediate supervision, but they were transferred within at least a year and a half after the close of activities in the Second World War.
Mr. DOYLE. And it has been continuously in the possession of the Archives since that time
Mr. PAGE. That is right. 
Mr. WOOD. And was transferred to your department by the Office of War Information?
Mr. PAGE. That is right; yes, sir.
Mr. WooD. Very well. There being no further questions, the witness will be excused, and we would appreciate it if you would furnish us with a photostat of that document as quickly as you can.
Mr. PAGE. As soon as I can, I will, sir. (Witness excused.) (Representative Harold H. Velde entered the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I call Mr. Leonardo Bercovici. TESTIMONY OF LEONARDO BERCOVICI, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, EUGENE GRESSMAN-Resumed
Mr. TAVENNER You have previously been sworn, Mr. Bercovici. I hand you Form 57 just presented by a representative of the National Archives staff, purportedly signed by you. Will you examine that, please, and state whether or not that is your signature at the end of it ?
Mr. BERcovICI (after examining document). Yes, Mr. Tavenner, that would appear to be my signature.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you look at paragraph 17 and read it into the record, please?
Mr. VELDE. Just a moment, Mr. Tavenner. He said it would appear to be his signature. Is it your signature?
Mr. BERCOVIcI. As far as I know that is my signature.
Mr. VELDE. What do you mean by as far as you know
Mr. BERCOVIcI. Yes, it is my signature.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you read section 17? Read it aloud into the record.  
Mr. BERcovIc 473 (reading): Do you advocate or have you ever advocated or are you now or have you ever been a member of any organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence? If so, give complete details under item 45. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your answer to that question, "yes" or "no"? 
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What answer appears on your form above your signature?
Mr. BERCOVICI. The answer is "No" as written on this document.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that answer truthful?
Mr. BERcovIcI. I decline to answer on the ground that it may tend to incriminate or degrade me and it violates my privileges under the Constitution, and especially under the fifth and first amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you let me see the form again? The date of this application for employment with the OWI is June 10, 1943. On that date were you a member or had you been a member of any organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence
Mr. BERCOVICI. I decline to answer that question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. NO questions.

Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER. No questions.
Mr. WoOD. Is there any reason to detain this witness further?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WOOD. You may be excused.
Mr. BERCOVICI. Thank you very much. (Witness excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Roy M. Brewer, please.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Brewer, will you stand and be sworn, please ? You solemnly swear the evidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God'?
Mr. BREWER. I do.
Mr. WooD. Have a seat. TESTIMONY OF ROY M. BREWER
