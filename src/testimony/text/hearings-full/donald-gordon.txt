Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Gordon?
Mr. GORDON. May I say just a word on the question of counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Oh, I beg your pardon. Do you have counsel?
Mr. WALTER. Are you represented by counsel?
Mr. GORDON. I wanted to say this, if I may. I was present in this room last Friday morning. I heard what seemed to me an improper and shocking attack upon another witness' attorney. At that point I felt that the right to have counsel was being invaded and I made up my mind that I could not subject any human being to another such attack, so though I do not waive any rights to counsel, I am here without counsel for that reason.
Mr. WALTER. Principally for the reason that you wanted to make the speech you just made; isn't that the reason ?
Mr. GORDON. No; the thought had not occurred to me until the incident had occurred, because I had intended to have counsel.
Mr. WALTER. Well, I want to say this to you, sir, that it is becoming annoying-and that is a gross understatement of fact-to members 1786  of this committee to see members of the bar not advising their clients but instructing them as to their answers. There is a vast difference, particularly when we happen to know that certain members of the bar who have appeared for witnesses here and in Washington are members of the ( ommunist Party and we have their own Communist Party cards, so perhaps I may be excused for expressing my opinions. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Gordon? 
Mr. GORDON. Bridgeport, Conn., November 21, 1903. SMr. TAVEXNER. Where do you now reside?
Mr. GORDON. Los Angeles.
Mr. TAENXER. How long have you lived in Los Angeles?
Mr. GORDON. Since 1912.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you lived here constantly since that time except for temporary travel?
Mr. GORDON. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you briefly outline for the committee your educational background, please, sir.
Mr. GORDON. I attended the elementary and high schools of Los Angeles and University of California at Los Angeles, and graduated from Pomona College in 1923 with a B. A. degree.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession?
Mr. GORDON. I am an editor.
Mr. TAVENNER. An editor? In the moving-picture industry or in newspaper work ?
Mr. GORDON. Oh, I am an assistant in the story department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Describe briefly what the duties of an editor are.
Mr. GORDOx. It is rather difficult to describe them briefly, but the major part of the work consists in reading manuscripts and mainly synopses, analyzing them and assisting the studio in finding the kind of stories it wants to produce.
Mr. TAVENXER. And selecting the writers for stories, does that also come within your duties?
Mr. GORDON. No. I have nothing whatever to do with the hiring of writers.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you review the scripts which are presented ?
Mr. GORDON. I read them and write comments upon them and they are passed on to other people.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do those comments constitute a recommendation either for or against the acceptance of the story for use in screen exhibition ?
Mr. GORDON. No, they are not concerned with the question of acceptance. They are concerned with the question of advancing them to a higher stage. I do not myself determine in any.way the purchase of any story.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand. But do you recommend in regard to acceptance ?
Mr. GORDON. I recommend further consideration to someone else, usually.
Mr. TAVENNER. But that is a recommendation either for or against the particular story which you have reviewed ?
Mr. GORDON. Well, it is not necessarily a recommendation to buy a story, it is a recommendation that other people should see the story.  1787 
Mr. TAVENNER. Meaning, of course, that it has met with your gen- eral approval as being a product which was worthy of acquiring?
Mr. GORDON. Worthy of further consideration.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been engaged in the work of an editor ?
Mr. GORDON. Well, I have been in my present position for a little over 3 years. Is that what you meant ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. Prior to that time what was your par- ticular work?
Mr. GORDON. I was head of the reading department at Paramount for 6 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe briefly what the duties of a reader are.
Mr. GORDON. Of a reader ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. GORDON. The primary work of a reader is to read literary and dramatic material and to synopsize it and to comment upon it. This is the first stage in a consideration of literary material.
Mr. TAVENNER. For how long a period of time did you engage in the work of a reader ?
Mr. GORDON. Well, I don't know how to put it because I have been a reader at various times and assistant at various times, head of reading, and back and forth. I have been engaged in this work for approximately 25 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Gordon, a witness, Mr. Martin Berkeley, who appeared before this committee, identified you as a member of the Communist Party and in so doing stated: I met with him with the Screen Writers' Guild. I attended a meeting of the Screen Writers' Guild at which I met Don Gordon and subsequently later met him at the meetings of the writers' fraction. Was that testimony by Mr. Berkeley true or was it false ?
Mr. GoRDON. Well, I have never been a member of the Screen Writers' Guild, except possibly at one point when the Screen Readers' Guild was in a sense affiliated with it. As to this testimony, or any response to your question, I claim the privilege under the fifth amend-. ment which states that a witness may not be required to testify against himself.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was it that the Readers' Guild was affiliated with the Screen Writers' Guild ?
Mr. GORDON. It was a long time ago, but I think it was somewhere in 1933 that that affiliation began and it terminated somewhere in the next 2 or 3 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you reside in 1932; did you tell us that?
Mr. GORDON. 1932 ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.
Mr. GORDOn. I have lived in the same house for about 18 years. I'm not sure of the exact date. It was either 1932 or 1933 that I moved into it.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present address ? 
Mr. GORDON. 6853 Pacific View Drive, Los Angeles, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to that time what was the place of your residence?
Mr. GORDON. Well, for about a year or so I lived on a street called, I think it was, Cumberland, but I don't remember the address. 1788 
Mr. TAVENNER. Cumberland Avenue? 
Mr. GonnoN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it 3961y? 
Mr. GORDON. I don't remember. As I say, it was more than 18 years ago. I really couldn't remember that.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand. You have no reason for believing that that was not the correct number, have you ?
Mr. GORDON. I just don't recall the number. No, I'm sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have before me a copy of a Communist Party petition to participate in primary election. I will read part of it: STATE OF CALIFORNIA, County of Los Angeles: TO THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA: We, the undersigned, registered, qualified voters of the State of California, county of Los Angeles, present to the secretary of State this petition and declare that we represent a political party, the name of which is Communist Party, which party said electors desire to have participate in the next primary election to be held August 30, 1932. I will ask you to look at this petition and ask you to consider the sixth name from the bottom of the page, which will be handed to you, and I will ask you to read whose name appears there and the address. The sixth name from the bottom of the page.
Mr. GORDON. It is a typewritten name there which is the same as mine, yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is the address ?
Mr. GORDON. 39611/ Cumberland, Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sign that petition?
Mr. GORDON. Frankly, I have no recollection of it. I just don't remember it at all. It is dated, you say, 1932?
Mr. TAVENNER. 1932, yes, sir.
Mr. GORDON. I'm sorry, I have no recollection of it. It's possible.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in 1932, the time of the filing of this petition ? 
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. 1938, or 1939, your residence was 6853 Pacific View, according to your testimony of a few moments ago?
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. TAVENNER. In 1938 or 1939 were you a member of Unit Shop No. 5 of the Communist Party and did you use the name of John Sherwood as your Communist Party name?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer the question on the grounds pre- viously stated. 
Mr. TAVENXER. The committee, in the course of its investigation, has ascertained that ydu made a number of contributions, literary contributions, to New Masses. I have in mind particularly a poem which appeared on April 9, 1939, issue, and articles appearing July 2, 1940; August 24, September 28, July 27, October 19, 1943; January 4, 1944; October 12, 1943. Would you mind stating to the committee the circumstances under which you made those contributions to the New Masses, if you did so?
Mr. GORDON. You say they were articles?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.  1789 
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer the question in any case, but I just don't understand what you are talking about, frankly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us not pass itMr. GORDON. You said a poem ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us not just pass it off quite that freely. I recognize that magazines such as New Masses might publish an article written by the most conservative of individuals, if they chose to do it. But what I am asking you is to state the circumstances under which your contributions were used, if they were.
Mr. GORDON. I claim the privilege of the fifth amendment and decline to answer the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a financial supporter of New Masses ?
Mr. GonRDN. I claim the same privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend any meetings which were beneficial parties-that is, parties organized for the purpose of raising money for the New Masses organization ?
Mr. GoRDON. I claim the same privilege and decline to answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time a member of the AmericanRussian Institute ?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. WALTER. When you say "I decline to answer on the same grounds," you mean in every instance that you decline to answer because of your privileges under the fifth amendment ?
Mr. GORDON. Yes, sir.
Mr. WALTER. So we can get the record straight.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were any closed Communist Party meetings held in your home ?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer on the basis of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with a club of the Communist Party known as the Meltzer, M-e-l-t-z-e-r, Club ?
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer on the same grounds and I claim the privilege of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the course of this investigation the committee has learned that a secret or private fund was raised for the benefit of the so-called white-collar strikers in the moving-picture industry in 1945. Do you know anything about the circumstances under which those funds were raised ?
Mr. GORDON. Would you describe that a little more specifically, because I really don't recognize anything about that. Describe it, please.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you make any contribution to a strikers' fund which was supposed to be a secret fund used for the benefit of the strikers in 1945?
Mr. GORDON. I have no such recollection. I have made some contributions to a welfare fund. Is that what you are getting at? For the aid of families of people who were in need; is that what you are referring to?
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, I don't know.
Mr. GORDON. It was a public corporation.
Mr. TAVENNER. I know.
Mr. GoRDON. I am very happy to tell you that I contributed small sums of money during those strikes to a public corporation organized to do charitable work for families in need during that strike. 1790  
Mr. TAVENNER. That was an open fund which the public generally, was invited to make donations to, was it not?
Mr. GORDON. Yes.
Mr. TA.\INNER. Well, the fund that I am talking about was a secret or closed fund.
Mr. GORDON. I see. Well, I decline to answer, and I claim the privi- lege of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Nora Hallgren? 
Mr. GORDON. I claim the privilege of the fifth amendment and de- cline to answer. Mir. TAVENNER. And Rube Lambert? 
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer and claim the privilege of the fifth amendment. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. NO doubt, Mr. Gordon, you are familiar with the Federal statute under which this committee which is before you now is directed to investigate subversive propaganda in the United States. Are you?
Mr. GORDON. Well, I have been sitting here for 31/2 days and I ought to have become a little familiar with it; yes, sir. 
Mr. DOYLE. I know, also, therefore, that you have heard me give
Mr. Webster's definition of the word "subversive."
Mr. GoRDox. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. What would you say as to whether or not the United States Congress had acted wisely in directing this committee to investigate subversive and un-American people and propaganda in line with Mr. Webster's definition of what subversive means ?
Mr. GORDOx. Well, Mr. Doyle, I don't know if any comment by me on tlie wisdom of Congress would be particularly pertinent. I am no authority on it. I have no particular opinion to express.
Mr. DOYLE. I asked it because I recognize you as a very brilliant gentleman with quite a history of able authorship, and I think a person who could help this committee if you so desire, and I thought perhaps in that particular field you might help us by your considered opinion. I think you indicated you had written some other books. What name do you use, what other names, Mr. Gordon, than just Donald Gordon?
Mr. GORDON. My writing has all been under the name of DonGordon just because it is shorter.
Mr. DOYLE. Don Gordon? 
Mr. GORDON. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. Have you ever used in any of your writings or articles the name John Sherwood?
Mr. GORDON. Not that I recall. I wrote a few short stories under various names at one time, but I think that was not one of them. 
Mr. DOYLE. What would you recommend, if anything, that this committee do other than it is doing to uncover subversive propaganda in this country that emanates from Soviet Russia or domestically? What recommendation have you to give us as an American citizen? What further should we do? 
Mr. GORDON. Well, Mr. Doyle, you have asked my opinion, and my complaint is really more concerned with the methods used than anything else, frankly. My own experience with this committee is, as I say, the last 31/2 days, and I have observed certain actions of the  INDUSTRY 1791 committee that I thought were quite improper. I am not questioning the legality of any statute or any legal question, but I have observedthere was the incident I mentioned before in regard to an attorney who was not a party to these hearings, was not subpenaed or who was not a witness who was, himself, attacked, which I think undermines the right to have counsel. Second, I have heard and read statements made by members of this committee on television, on radio, and before the press challenging the fifth amendment, itself. I consider this improper conduct on the part of this committee. I considerMr. DOYLE. May IMr. GORDON. Just a moment. May I finish? You asked my opinion.
Mr. WALTER. Let him finish. 
Mr. GORDON. You asked me for my opinion. I am very disturbed on this point, because I feel quite strongly on it. I am only a witness now at this moment and yet, for a week, the public has been listening to the opinions of this committee on the question of the fifth amendment and other questions, which means that informatory and denunciatory statements have been made about me before I even had a chance to appear here. The stand that I had not yet taken was already challenged by this committee. I consider that improper conduct on the part of this committee.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, a Communist-at least, one who was formerly a Communist came in and gave your name as a fellowCommunist, and then we gave you an opportunity, and that is why you are here, to come in to defend yourself, and you refused to defend yourself hiding or claiming the privilege of the fifth amendment, and we don't criticize you for claiming the fifth amendment. That is one of the major differentiations between this country and Soviet Russia and other Communist nations. It is quite surprising to me, sir, that you should claim the fifth amendment privilege when you offer to give advice to this committee. Why don't you come clean like some other men have? Inferentially or, may I say, that we are informed that you have been a Communist. We are informed that you now are. If you are not, why don't you say you are not ? I invite you to say you are not. Do you deny that you were a Communist and now you are?
Mr. GORDoN. Mr. Doyle, you also invited me to express my opinion of this committee.
Mr. DOYLE. That's right. .Mr. GORDON. When I expressed it, you criticized me for expressing it.
Mr. DOYLE. No; I am not criticizing you.
Mr. GORDON. And you again attack my right under the fifth amendment, which I still consider improper conduct for a Congressman and a member of this committee to do. If the fifth amendment has any validity, then I have a right to use it and no one has any right to question my use of it, including you.
Mr. DOYLE. You were here without counsel-Mr. GORDON. I explained why I was here without counsel.
Mr. DOYLE. Let me ask you again, do you deny that you are now a Communist ?
Mr. GORDON. I refuse to answer, claim the privilege of the fifth amendment which you are attacking. 1792 
Mr. DOYLE. No; I am not attacking the fifth amendment and don't you say that I am. 
Mr. GORDoN. Mr. Doyle, you said I was hiding behind it. That is an attack.
Mr. DOYLE. I think you are hiding behind it, sir.
Mr. GORDON. I am not hiding behind anything.
Mr. DOYLE. I think you are hiding behind the fifth amendment, because I think you are now a Communist.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Gordon, were you ever a member of the Ku Klux Klan?
Mr. GORDON. I was not.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you ever a member of the Silver Shirts ?
Mr. GORDON. I was not.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party? 
Mr. GORDON. I decline to answer. amendment. I claim privilege of the fifth 
Mr. JACKSON. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WALTER. Any questions, Mr. Potter?
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Gordon, as a story editor-I believe that was the title of your work?
Mr. GORDON. I am an assistant in the story department.
Mr. POTTER. If I recall your testimony, you pass on script-that is, to see whether that script should be recommended for further study by some other person; is that right?
Mr. GORDON. I make suggestions for the further consideration of literary material.
Mr. POTrER. In other words, if you should make the suggestion that this material was of no value the writer of that script would be out?
Mr. GORDON. That is not true.
Mr. PorrER. I am asking you. I don't know.
Mr. GORDON. Well, I realize you do not know. I realize the question, itself, and the previous question when I didn't go into it with
Mr. Tavenner-really, after 4 year's investigation it reveals an astounding lack of familiarity with the way studios operate.
Mr. POTTER. We are asking for your advice.
Mr. GORDON. I will be very happy to give it to you. There is a complicated process involving a number of people in every story department, and, certainly, at least in the one I am in, to say that one individual's opinion is a determining factor in the recommendation to consider material is wrong, least of all to purchase it. The story department does not purchase material; it merely passes it on to producers and executives who then decide what they want to purchase.
Mr. PorrER. Did you ever receive instructions to deny a favorable recommendation to a person that you considered not friendly to Communist cause ?
Mr. GORDON. Well, this is a very complicated and loaded question. I will say this: If anyone had made such a recommendation to me I would have ignored it on the grounds that it would have been simply idiocy to do any thing of that sort. It couldn't possibly be accomplished and you wouldn't hold your job more than 24 hours if you tried it. I have no further questions.
Mr. POTTrr.  INDUSTRY 1793 
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Gordon, you were asked the question as to wheth- er or not you were a Communist in 1932 anid you refused to answer the question. That was before the Smith Act was enacted into the law. It is certainly more than 5 years, which is the statutory period provided for in the Smith Act. Why do you feel that you would be incriminated if you would answer a question at to whether or not you were a Communist in 1932 ?
Mr. GoRDON.
Mr. WALTER.
Mr. GORDON.
Mr. WALTER. 1932? Well, I wasn't asked that question, I believe. Yes; you were asked that question. I was asked about some document there. You were asked a question, were you a Communist in 
Mr. GORDON. Is that the question ?
Mr. WALTER. Yes. 
Mr. GORDON. I thought it was about that petition, of which I have no recollection. Well, I don't think that I am required to give reasons for using the fifth amendment.
Mr. WALTER. You are not required to give a reason, but I was just curious about it because, under the law, you could not be prosecuted for committing anything short of murder and treason that was done in 1932.
Mr. GoRDoN. Well, sir, I heard yesterday, I think it was, a brief controversy between Congressman Walter and eminent local attorney on the subject. Since opinion was so sharply divided, really, I don't feel qualified to pass upon the subject at this point.
Mr. WALTER. You have testified that you contributed to a fund for the relief of families of strikers; which fund was it that you contributed to ?
Mr. GORDON. It was called the Hollywood welfare fund. 
Mr. WALTER. Then you declined to testify as to another fund. What was the name of that? 
Mr. GORDON. No name was given. I don't know what he was talking about, to tell you the truth. 
Mr. WALTER. All right. Any further questions, Mr. Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. NO further questions. 
Mr. WALTER. The witness may be excused.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Josef Mischel. 
Mr. WALTER. Will you raise your right hand Will you swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. MISCHEL. I do.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Mischel, are you represented by counsel? 
Mr. MISOHEL. Yes, sir.
Mr. WALTER. Will counsel please identify himself for the record.
Mr. MoRRIs. Robert Morris of Los Angeles.
Mr. WALTER. M-o-r-r-i-s?
Mr. MORRIS. That is correct. TESTIMONY OF JOSEF MISCHEL, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL, ROBERT S. MORRIS, JR.
