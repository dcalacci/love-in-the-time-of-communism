Mr. GOUGH. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented by counsel?
Mr. GOUrH. I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel please identify himself for the record?
Mr. POPPER. Martin Popper, 160 Broadway, New York City.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Gough I
Mr. GOUGi. I was born in New York City during the panic of 1907.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where do you now reside? .Mr. GOUGH. Well, being an actor I usually reside wherever I am. I do not have any permanent residence anywhere. Until I came to Washington I was residing in Los Angeles. 463 464  
Mr. TAVENNER. What address?
Mr. GOUGH. 2723 Laurel Canyon.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state for the committee briefly your educational background, please, sir ?
Mr. GOUGH. Well, my formal'schooling was in the public and paro- chial schools in New York and Brooklyn, which I attended until I was 12 years old. That is the end of my formal schooling. 
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been the nature of your employment in your professional capacity?
Mr. GOUGH. Well, I went to work at the age of 12 in Wall Street for $8 a week, and did a variety of other things until 1930, at which time I went into the theater. I have worked in summer stock and Broadway plays, road companies, et cetera. In 1946 I went to California, and in 1947 I began working in motion pictures.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were you employed in the motion picture industry ? That is, by whom were you employed ? 
Mr. GOUGH. Well, I have worked for several of the major studios and several of the so-called independent studios. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Which were the studios for which you worked?
Mr. GOUGH. MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, Universal; there seem to be some more in there, but I don't quite remember. major studios. Those were the 
Mr. TAVENNER. What were some of the major pictures in which you took part ?
Mr. GOUGH. Well; I just finished a picture called Chuck-a-luck. Prior to that I wa's in Valentine; before that in The Scarf; and a variety of others which I don't recall too clearly. I can remember Body and Soul; That Wonderful Urge; and Rivoli. I am sorry to be so slow. There are so many of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the producer of Body and Soul? 
Mr. GOUGH. The producer was, I believe the name was Enterprise Film Productions, or some such thing. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who composed the organization that you referred to? 
Mr. GOUGH. You mean the officers of the corporation?
Mr. TAVE NER. Yes, the owners.
Mr. GOUGH. Well, it is hard for me to say. I am an actor. We don't have much contact with the actual producers. There.was-let's see. This is 6 years ago-5 years ago, I am sorry. I am sorry, I really can't tell offhand just who were the officials of the corporation, or the producers of the picture. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the director?
Mr. GOUGH. It is a matter of public record who directed any pic- ture I was in.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, have you any objection to telling who the director was of the picture you were in? 
Mr. GOUGH (after conferring with his counsel). This question puts me in the position of testifying against myself. Consequently, I would like your permission to invoke the privileges granted me under the fifth and first amendments. My answer to the question may tend to incriminate me. 
Mr. WooD. The committee cannot give you permission; you have the right to invoke the privilege, but you do not have the permission of the committee to do so. The committee wants the truth. If you  465 desire to invoke the privilege under the Constitution of the United States providing that a man in a criminal case may not be required to testify against himself, and if you think an answer to the question asked would so incriminate you in a criminal case, you have the right to claim the privilege, but don't give the impression that this committee will give you permission to claim it, because we do not have that authority.
Mr. GOUGH. That was an ambiguous phrase. I must decline to answer the question on the grounds as I stated them.
Mr. WooD. Let me see if I understand you correctly. Do you claim that an answer as to who directed a picture that you appeared in and acted in, notwithstanding the fact you say it is a matter of public record, that to divulge that would tend to incriminate you in a criminal prosecution ?
Mr. GOUGH. The specific picture that is under discussion, I am confident that for me to do anything but decline to answer the question would tend to incriminate me, and consequently I must invoke the privileges of the fifth and first amendments.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question? 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the cameraman? 
Mr. GOUGH. I am not sure, but I think it was James Wong Howe.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the executive? 
Mr. GOUGH. Mr. Jackson, you know that actors don't have too much contact with the executives of the corporation.
Mr. JACKSON. You don't know who had actual charge of the production ?
Mr. GOUGH. There was a business manager, or I guess you could call him the production manager. Joseph Gilton. I remember his name. It was 
Mr. JACKSON. Who did the script? 
Mr. GOUGH. Excuse me. [After conferring with his counsel:] I am afraid I must decline to answer that question on the grounds I previously stated.
Mr. JACKSON. Self-incrimination? In your mind you distinguish as between the cameraman and the script writer and director ?
Mr. GoUGH. I am not sure of the name of the cameraman. [After conferring with his counsel:] And I feel that the committee here before which I am appearing has made this distinction.
Mr. JACKSON. The committee has made no distinction. You yourself have said that you are afraid you will incriminate yourself by answering these questions as to these individuals. That is a determination of your own. We haven't made that distinction at all. It is you, in your own mind, upon advice of counsel, who have made that distinction. I have no further questions at this time.
Mr. WooD. Proceed, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Who played the principal role in Body and Soul ? 
Mr. GOUGH. I am afraid I must decline to answer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Gough, were you present at the home of Karen Morley at the time an investigator of this committee appeared there to serve process for her appearance before this committee?
Mr. GOUGH. I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated. 466 
Mr. TAVENNER. Your presence at the home of Karen Morley, you contend, might tend to incriminate you
Mr. GOUGH. Your pursuit of this line of inquiry, Mr. Tavenner, I believe tends to destroy the privilege I have just invoked.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where is Karen Morley today ? 
Mr. GOUGH. I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know where she is ?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Gough, Miss Hazel Huffman, an investigator for the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, participated in certain activities of the American Peace Mobilization, and she testified before this committee in May 1941 that you attended a section of the American People's Meeting which met in Mecca Temple, New York City, on April 5, 1941, and that you were also present at Randall's Island, New York City, on that same day, at a meeting sponsored by the American Peace Mobilization. Is that a correct statement ?
Mr. GOUGH. I am afraid I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. WOOD. Do you so decline?
Mr. GOUGH. I do decline to answer on the grounds I stated earlier.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Actors' Equity Asso- ciation?
Mr. GOUGH. All actors in the theatre are required to belong to Actors' Equity Association.
Mr. WOOD. Do you mean by that, that you are a member of it?
Mr. GOUGH. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attempt to induce that association to send a delegation to Randall's Island to attend a meeting sponsored by the American Peace Mobilization?
Mr. GOUGH. I will decline to answer on the grounds stated earlier.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you ever affiliated with the Theater Arts Committee?
Mr. GouGH. I must decline to answer the question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you treasurer of that organization ? Just a moment. I hand you a sheet showing the members of the executive board of the Theater Arts Committee, a printed statement.
Mr. WooD. Do you have a date ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Bearing date December 1, 1939, in which the name appears, Lloyd Gough, under the title "Treasurer." Will you look at that and state whether or not you were treasurer of the organization at that time ?
Mr. GOUGH (after examining document and conferring with his counsel). I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understood you to state that you went to Hollywood in 1946 ?
Mr. GOUGH. That is right, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. After your arrival in Hollywood, did you become chairman of the executive committee of the Actors' Laboratory ?
Mr. GOUGH. I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.  INDUSTRY 467 
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you affiliated with the Progressive Citizens of America?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your name appears as one of those on a brief amicus curiae filed with the Supreme Court of the United States in the case against Trumbo and Lawson. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under which you permitted the use of your name on that brief, if you did authorize it to be done ?
Mr. GOUGH. I must decline to answer on the grounds I stated earlier, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Gough, there has been testimony before this committee by Mr. Sterling Hayden and also by Mr. Marc Lawrence, the effect of which is that you attended certain Communist Party meetings at which each of them was present. Mr. Hayden testified that you attended several of the meetings that he attended, but he did not state that he definitely knew that you were a member of the Communist Party. I asked him this question: Do you have any knowledge on your own part as to whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party? referring to you, and Mr. Hayden answered: Well, I would say it would probably be safe to assume that he was. Then I said: I don't want you to assume it. And Mr. Hayden said: I have absolutely, categorically, no knowledge that he was. Did you attend Communist Party meetings with Mr. Hayden, or at which Mr. Hayden was present?
Mr. GOUGH. I must decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Gough, there is no compulsion on your part to decline. When you say you must decline, do you mean you do decline?
Mr. GOUGH. I am sorry. I am giving it to you in too many words.
Mr. WooD. Do you decline?
Mr. GOUGH. I do decline.
Mr. WOOD. For the reasons you have previously stated ?
Mr. GOUGH. Yes; thank you. 
Mr. TAVENNER. In the course of the testimony of Mr. Marc Lawrence, when he was asked the names of persons who attended Com- munist Party meetings with him and who belonged to Communist cells to which he had been assigned, this question was asked: Were there others whose names you can now recall?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Well, there were kids at the lab that I don't recall, whose names I don't remember. They were also at the cell meetings. I don't remember them. This is what I do remember. This is actual. There was a meeting held at Karen Morley's house one night in which there was a kind of bunch of actors. Sterling Hayden was there. Larry Parks was there. They were discussing some big thing about what to do with the actors. There was a lot of fuss made at the time. And I remember Sterling and I remember Larry. I remember Anne Revere, Howard Da Silva, Lloyd Gough, and these people. That is what I do remember. Now, I don't know if these people were members of the Communist Party, but it was supposed to have been a closed cell. couldn't identify these people. I 468 Now, did you attend a meeting at the home of Karen Morley as described by Mr. Lawrence ?
Mr. GOUGH (after conferring with his counsel). I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you living in Hollywood in 1947?
Mr. GOUGH. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. In January of 1947 did you attend a meeting at the home of Waldo and Mary Salt which was attended also by Paul Perlin, P-e-r-l-i-n ?
Mr. GouGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Gough, you refused to answer questions as to whether you were a member of the Theater Arts Committee. Why? 
Mr. GOUGH. I feel that this question is merely a pursuit of the pre- vious questions to which it refers. 
Mr. WALTER. Have you ever been a member of that committee?
Mr. GOUGH. I must decline to answer the question on the grounds I stated previously.
Mr. WALTER. That committee is not listed as a Communist or Com- munist-front organization ? 
Mr. GOUGH. I believe it is, sir.
Mr. WALTER. Are you a member of the Elks?
Mr. GOUGH. I am sorry to say I am not.
Mr. WALTER. Are you a member of the Knights of Columbus?
Mr. GOUGH. No, sir.
Mr. WALTER. What organizations do you belong to?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds I previously stated, the first and fifth amendments.
Mr. WALTER. You didn't hesitate a moment in answering the ques- tion as to whether or not you were a member of the Elks or of the Knights of Columbus.
Mr. GOUGH. It is my opinion, sir, my firm conviction, that I can be incriminated through membership in certain organizations and am free to belong to other organizations.
Mr. WALTER. What crime could you possibly be charged with if you were a member of the Theater Arts Committee ?
Mr. GOUGH. I am sure my counsel could state this much more clearly than I could.
Mr. WALTER. After all, it is your answer. You declined to answer the question on the ground you felt it might tend to incriminate you. I am asking you what crime you feel you might be charged with if you were a member of that organization ? 
Mr. GOUGH (after conferring with his counsel). The Eighty-second and the Eighty-first Congresses, and previous Congresses, have both passed legislation which would tend to incriminate members of certain organizations.  469 
Mr. WALTER. So that you feel that if you admitted that you be- longed to that organization, you would subject yourself to prosecution?
Mr. GOUGH. Possible prosecution; yes, sir.
Mr. WALTER. Then is it fair for me to draw the inference that you do belong to this organization, and that is the reason why you won't answer the question? SMr. GOUGH (after conferring with his counsel). As I understand the amendment I have invoked, for the committee or any member of the committee to draw any inference from my refusal to answer the questions on the grounds I stated certainly is a violation of my constitutional privileges.
Mr. WALTER. Don't you think that you are intimating that my constitutional privilege to draw that inference is being violated, when you make that statement ?
Mr. GOUGH. As a public official I don't think you are privileged to inquire beyond my declination to answer. Were you sitting here, I think you would-I am sorry. (After conferring with his counsel:) I was about to say, as a private individual, of course you have that right.
Mr. WALTER. That is all. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. No questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions. 
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. NO questions. 
Mr. WooD. Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. You spoke something about your rights. Don't you, know that a witness before this committee really has more rights than a witness in a court of law as far as answering questions is concerned ?
Mr. GOUGH. I don't know that the witness has any more rights here.
Mr. KEARNEY. What I have in mind is this-and I think counsel this time will agree with me-that in a court of law if you are on the witness stand you don't have the opportunity of consulting your counsel on every question asked you. Here you do. (Witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. KEARNEY. You don't need to answer that.
Mr. GoUGH.- Thank you very much.
Mr. KARNEY. That is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no questions, only one comment bearing on 
Mr. Walter's statement.. I would like to point out that a great horse, Man 0' War, got a great reputation because he was seen around stables and races so much, and if the analogy is not clear, I will say I personally come to the same conclusion as Mr. Walter so far as your membership is concerned. That is all.
Mr. GOUGH. May I comment, too, sir
Mr. JACKSON. Yes. 
Mr. GOUGH. I have traveled around this country a great deal in a variety of forms of accommodations, and anyone with whom I have associated has been American.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions, Mr. Jackson ? 470 INDUSTRY In line with contributions which you may have made, have you ever contributed to the Community Chest?
Mr. GOUGH. Yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you ever contributed to Red Cross ?
Mr. GOUGH. Yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you ever contributed to Actors' Laboratory ?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you ever contributed to the Communist Party ?
Mr. GOUGH. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. JACKSON. Yes. May I say something about contributions?
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Gough, I failed to get your age. How old are you?
Mr. GOUGH. I will be 44 in September. 
Mr. POTTER. Were you in the armed services during the war ?
Mr. GOUGH. Yes, sir; in France, Belgium, and Germany.
Mr. POTTER. Would you serve the United States if you were called ? 
Mr. GOUGH. Right now?
Mr. POTTER. Yes. 
Mr. GOUGH. Well, Mr. Potter, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Republican leader in the Senate, and Mr. Ernest T. Weir, chairman of the board of directors of National Steel Corp., have all said we won't be ready to launch a war for approximately 2 years. It seems to me you are pushing me into the firing line somewhat prematurely.
Mr. POTTER. I am asking you whether, if you were called, the same as a lot of men are being called, would you serve?
Mr. GOUGH. I am a law-abiding citizen, and if there is a law in this country that I can be called to serve in the Army I would simply repeat the process in World War II, the war against fascism.
Mr. POTTER. In other words, you would fight against communism the same as you fought against fascism ?
Mr. GOUGH. the law.
Mr. POTTER.
Mr. GOUGH.
Mr. POTTER. I would certainly have to go if I were called, or violate And you would do so ? I would not violate the law. You would carry out your obligations as a citizen and fight against communism if you were so called ?
Mr. GOUGH. I think we have decided the nature of the war a little too soon.
Mr. POTTER. You brought it up. You said you fought against fascism in the last war.
Mr. GOUGH. I said I would go in the Army. You are asking what I would fight against.
Mr. POTTER. Yes, I would like to know if you would be on our side or on the other side. You refuse to answer categorically whether you would fight against communism if you were called.
Mr. GOUGH. I said I would go in the United States Army. I think that answers the question.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir. 
Mr. WOOD. There is a vote and we will have to recess for 35 minutes. (Short recess.)  471 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have been authorized by the chairman to announce that because of pressing business on the floor of the House the hearing will be adjourned until 2 o'clock this afternoon. (Thereupon, at 11: 40 a. m., a recess was taken until 2 p. m. of the same day.) AFTERNOON SESSION 
Mr. WOOD. The committee will be in order. Let the record show that there are present the following members of the committee: Mr. Walter, Mr. Doyle, Mr. Kearney, Mr. Jackson,
Mr. Potter, and Mr. Wood, a quorum of the committee. 
Mr. POPPER. This morning, as a result of a roll call, there was no announcement by the chairman formally excusing Mr. Gough. 
Mr. WooD. Do we have any reason to detain him further, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WOOD. He may be excused. 
Mr. POPPER. May I place in the record a statement ? 
Mr. WooD. It will be received and filed with the committee. (The statement referred to is on file with the committee.) 
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to call Mr. Thad Page.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Page, will you hold up your right hand, please. Do you solemnly swear the evidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. PAGE. I.do.
Mr. WooD. Have a seat. TESTIMONY OF THAD PAGE
