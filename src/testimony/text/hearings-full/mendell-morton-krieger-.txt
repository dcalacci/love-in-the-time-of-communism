Mr. WHEELER. Just in the medical profession ? Dr. KRIEGER. No; in all professions.
Mr. WHEELER. In all professions.
Mr. JACKSON. It was a white-collar club, so to speak ? Dr. KRIEGER. I guess you would call it that, that's correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Generally speaking.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals were in attendance at these meetings? Dr. KRIEGER. Offhand, it is hard for me to honestly answer you. I would judge roughly-the cell, I believe, comprised approximately 40 members, or thereabouts; maybe a little more.
Mr. WHEELER. Forty? Dr. KRIEGER. That's right.
Mr. WHEELER. Where did these meetings take place, do you recall? Dr. KRIEGER. Various houses.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any of the people who owned the houses? Dr. KRIEGER. I recall one whose house we met at a few times, and then there were a couple of others, and I very honestly cannot recall their names at the present time. They didn't strike me as anything outstanding, and I can't remember their names.
Mr. WHEELER. What is the name of the one individual you do remember ? Dr. KRIEGER. It was a physician by the name of Murray Ahowitz.

Mr. WHEELER. Do yOH recall who was treasurer? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir: I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the group have a literary director? Dr. KRIEGER. You mean a librarian?

Mr. WHEELER. That was you? Dr. KRIEGER. That's right.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall to whom Vou paid dues? Dr. KRIEGER. I can't recall the lady's name. It was a lady, and I can't recall her name.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you literary director, or librarian, as you term it? Dr. KRIEGER. I would say, offhand, about 5 months.
Mr. WHEELER. Where did you buy your literature? Dr. KRIEGER. I believe it was called the Progressive Book Shop, over on Sixth Street.
Mr. WHEELER. Progressive? I)r. KRIEGER. Yes. It used to be over on Sixth Street. I think it was between Hill and Olive. Yes; Hill and Olive, I think.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you instructed by the party to buy your literature there? I r. KRIEGER. To go there and buy it; that's correct.
Mr. WHEELER. You bought literature there which you, in turn, sold to other members of the group Dr. KRIEGER. That's riaht.
Mr. JACKSON. From whom did you receive the instructions to purchase literature there? Dr. KRIEGER. From the-I believe it was from the-I don't recall whether it was one person, individually, or whether it was the executive committee as a whole, but I was told to go there and purchase the literature, to be brought back and sold.
Mr. JACKSON. Who constituted the executive committee at that time ? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, there was Eleanor Abowitz and Murray, and, I think-I can't honestly recall any other names on the committee at the time.
Mr. JACKSON. Go ahead.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend any fraction meeting of the literary or librarians of different cells? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. I wonder if you would identify all the individuals whom you knew as members of the Communist Party. Dr. KRIEGER. Well, Eleanor and Murray Abowitz and-let's see. There was a girl by the name of Katz. I believe she was the wife of the attorney, Katz. I can't recall her first name, offhand. There was another one by the name of Targo. I believe her first name was Evelyn. 2102 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. JACKSON. How do you spell the last name, Doctor ? Dr. KRIEGER. I believe it was T-a-r-g-o. I am not sure.
Mr. JACKSON. Targo? Dr. KRIEGER. That's correct.
Mr. WHEELER. What was her occupation ? Dr. KRIEGER. So far as I know, she was a housewife. Very frankly, I'll tell you, it has been so long ago that I honestly can't remember a lot of the names of people that were in the group.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall attending a meeting at the home of Murray Abowitz, at which Charley Katz was present? Dr. KRIEGER. No; I do not.
Mr. WIIEELER. Do you know Charles Katz? Dr. KRIEGER. No; I do not know him personally.
Mr. WHEELER. You have never met Charles Katz? Dr. KRIEGER. No, ir; not that I know of. 1 may have met hun under an assumed name, but I don't know him by that name.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Howard Davis? Dr. KRIEGER. Yes; that's right. IHe and his n ife, too, were members.
Mr. WHEELER. What was MAr. Davi ' wife's name? Dr. KRInEER. That I can't recall.
Mr. WHEnLER. What was Mr. Davis' occupation? Dr KIIEcRFI. He is an optometrist.
Mr. WHEELER. He is a doctor? Dr. KRIEGER. That's correct.
Mr WHEELER. What other doctors did you know to be members of the Communist Party? Did you know Dr. Hy Engelberg? Dr. KRIEGER. No; I don't know him.
Mr. JACKSON. May I interject a short statement at this point, Doctor? The subcommittee appreciates the extent of your cooperation. It is not our desire-I assume that in the interim you have completely broken with the Communist Party? Dr. KRIEGEI. I have.
Mr. JACKSON. Are you today opposed to the policies of international communism? Dr. KRIEGER. I am.
Mr. JACKSON. Would you bear arms in the defense of this country if called upon Dr. KRIEGER. I would.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you consider yourself in every respect a loyal American ? Dr. KRIEGER. I certainly do.
Mr. JACKSON. It is certainly not the desire, nor the wish of the House committee, to unduly embarrass or to bring unfavorable publicity upon those who have sincerely broken with the Communist Party. However, I feel that I should say that in making up our agenda, we are going to take into consideration the extent of the cooperation afforded the committee by the witnesses we are hearing. That cooperation must largely be conditioned upon the willingness and the frankness of the witness to testify fully and completely on his associations and activities within the Communist Party, with special emphasis placed upon his associates. I say this preliminary to taking any further testimony, because I recognize, as all of us do, the natural reluctance of anyone to discuss his associates. However, again, 'COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2103 I say that that is the crux of this investigation, so I urge-you have been, to this point, fully cooperative, and I urge you to not withhold the names of your associates and to cooperate fully in that regard. While I cannot, of course, state the action of the subcommittee upon its arrival here in Los Angeles with respect to the open hearings, I will say again that my personal predilection is to go as easy as possible upon those who do cooperate with us at this point of the hearings. I thought I should put that statement in, not as a threat or not as a promise, but simply to make our position clear, especially with respect to those who are engaged in the professional arts and those whose hvelihood may well be at stake, and so 1 do solicit your full cooperation at tins particular period in the hearings. All right, Mr. Wheeler.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. May 1 make a statement here'
Mr. JACKSON. Yes, of course, Mr. Krieger.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. When my brother was served with this subpena and lie brought the subpoena to me, my advice to him was to disclose to this committee as iiuch information as was available to lmn and to his memory. It must be remembered that he has not been a member of the Communist Party for a matter of 6 or 7 years.. We appreciate that many things, particularly those that are not favorable, do not remain in our memories too vividly. We try to forget them. I think that Dr. Krieger has shown his cooperation, even prior to this I don't know whether you are cognizant of the fact that hearing the FBI took him to Canada as a witness against-Mr. JACKSON. I have been so informed.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. Yes. It so happens that we are a family of professional people. He, being the youngest, got the wrath of all of us when that story broke. We knew nothing of it prior to the time he went to Canada. The thing that 1 want in the record is that he has been advised that he is to give this committee such information as is within his memory and, I think, after the talk that I had with him, that when he says he doesn't remember, that he honestly is giving the right information.
Mr. JACKSON. I am quite willing to accept that in good faith as being a true statement. I merely put my few remarks in there becauseMr. ARNOLD KIIEGER. We appreciate that.
Mr. JACKSON. I wanted them to be in the record. Go ahead, Mr. Wheeler.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any additional people that you knew to be members of the Communist Party? Dr. KRIEGER. As members of the party or in the particular cell that I belonged to?
Mr. WHEELER. The particular cell that you belonged to. Dr. KRIEGER. I can't honestly remember some of the names. I can pictures some of the faces. Perhaps if some of the names were recalled to me I might know.
Mr. WHEELER. fow many doctors were in this group ? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, that is something I can't honestly answer you, sir, because some of the people at some time-first of all, none of us were told what the other one was. It was only by association that some of us found out what each other-who we were or what we did and so, therefore, there may have been other doctors in there and I did not know that they were doctors. 2104 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anybody else who was a member of this group? Dr. KRIEGER. This particular cell? MR. WHEELER. Yes. Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir; I honestly don't. I can't recall any further names.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you acquainted with Dr. Gordon Rosenblum? Dr. KRIEGER. Yes; I know him. He was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Dr. Rosenblum was a member of the Communist Party ? Dr. KRIEGER. That's right.
Mr. WHEELER. Out of that group that I have named, you knew Dr. Gordon Rosenblum; is that right ? Dr. KRIEGER. This last group; that's right.
Mr. WHIIEELER. Did you know Lillian Doran ? Dr. KRIEGER. Who10 
Mr. WHIEELER. Lillian Doran. Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the nature of your testimony in Canada ? Dr. KRIEGER. I testified in regard to my association with Sam Witczak.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your association with Sam Witczak' Dr. KRIEGER. Oh, what way do you want to know that In other wordsMr. WHEELER. I would like a detailed account of when 3 ou met Mr. Witczak and the nature of your acquaintance with him, what transpired and the last time you saw Mr. Witczak. Dr. KRIEGER. The last time I saw him-well, I Iirst met him in 19,38. The last time I saw him, I think, was in 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you give us a complete story, without asking leading questions all the way through? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, may I interject a statement here at the present time ? I will be glad to tell you what I can recall. However, may I say this, that the entire testimony and record is with the FBI. I don't know whether you have access to those filesMr. WHEELER. We do not have access to them. Dr. KRIEGER. All right. I first met him in 1938 at the University of Southern California, at which time we were strictly friends. I mean, I didn't know anything about him other than that he was a student there, a foreign student, and we used to chat occasionally. We eventually became very friendly and began talking politics, and at the time I used to do a little writing and-never professionally, or anything; just for my own personal use or good, and I happened to show himn a few things I wrote, in which he was interested, and he asked me how I would like to perhaps go to China as a correspondent, as a foreign correspondent for somebody there, and it rather intrigued me at the time.
Mr. JACKSON. Pardon the interruption. As a foreign correspondent for a publication? Dr. KRIEGER. For a man in China that he at that time said he knew who had a newspaper, and so forth, and we-in other words, the Japanese aggression in China, and lie would ask me about it and so on, and I was very much against it, and this man in China, who had a paper, whatever it was-lie said he would be interested in my writ- COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2105 ing articles, and so on, correspondence, apparently, at least to him, was ,held back and forth, and finally he got a letter from this man here stating that he would like to have me come there. So time passed, and there was no further-nothing further, was said, and then in 1940 I enlisted in the Air Corps-United States Air Corps as a cadet and was accepted and taken in. However, I was given a physical discharge after I was in for about a little over 2 months and then shortly after I got out, why, I was married and then Mr. Witczak approached me at that time to go to Japan instead of to China, and he had told me that everything was arranged, and so forth, and it was just a matter of his getting the money, because I had no money of my own to go and, of course, he told me it would be excellent to go on a honeymoon trip, so forth and so on. Then he began telling me what the purpose was of going there, which was to be used as, I guess what you would call a "letter drop" in Japan. However, I never divulged that information to my wife. Eventually the money was forthcoming, and we were to go. In fact, we booked passage, got on the boat, got as far as San Francisco when we were taken off, and that is as far as we ever got, and we were taken off at that time-I believe the State Department wasn't allowing anybody to go over that had not had any prior business, and so we came back, at which time Mr. Witczak wanted me to go to South America for the same purposes, and which both my wife and I refused to do, and then he kept-we kept on friendly relations after that, because he was a very brilliant fellow and I enjoyed talking to him, and every once in awhile, of course, he would approach me with some proposition or other. However, I refused anything and everything that he had asked me to do after that, and then finally in 19-I believe it was in 1944-he came to my office one day and wanted me to set up an office whereby he could partake in it and have some space there, and so forth, to be used as a front for him, and that was all. He just mentioned it to me, and then I didn't see or hear from him for awhile, and then he approached me again and told me that I was back in the good graces, and so forth, of the powers that be in Moscow and he had received money to set up an office for me, and so forth, which I refused to do. Then I didn't see him until about the following fall when he and his wife had had a baby and had a party, and we wentthere and he wanted me to go with him. At the time while we were at the party, he suggested-he was leaving for New York and suggested I travel with him, go there, because there were a few higher-ups he wanted me to meet, and so forth, and I would learn a few of the whys and hows and wherefores, and I refused to go with him at that time. Then later I learned-a year later-when the Canadian thing broke, that he was leaving at that time because he had been told to get out.
Mr. WHEELER. You are talking about the Canadian espionage trial, the revelation by Gouzenko ? Dr. KRIEGER. Gouzenko; that's right. That, briefly, is the story.
Mr. JACKSON. What acquaintances did you have in common? That is, did he ever approach you in company with anyone? Dr. KRIEGER. No. I met people at his house, but nothing was ever discussed in front of anybody. I mean, if their politics were discussed when anyone else was around he more or less would sit back and not say too much or, at school, if politics were discussed, it de- 2106 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY pended on who he was talking to the way he would discuss politics. I mean, he could swing from one end to the other or go right down the middle. It didn't make any difference to him. He could talk any way that you believed. So far as any actual discussion of what he was doing when anybody else was around, that, there never was.
Mr. JACKSON. Who were the close friends of his whom you observed at his house ? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, there was a man who has since died. He was a physicist, and I can't recall his name, other than Joe something or other. I don't recall what his last name is now. I would know it if I heard it.
Mr. WHEELER. Where was he employed ? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, he was teaching at the time, as far as I knew, at some-I believe some small university, and then I think he got in on the-he was working up at Berkeley in the atomic project, or something, when he was killed in this airplane accident. Clarence Fetterly was a very close friend of Witczak's.
Mr. WHEELER. Who is Clarence Fetterly? Dr. KRIEGER. He is a man who is just in the papers, just, I believe. cited for perjury, or something, in front of the grand jury.
Mr. JACKSON. Was he a member of the Communist Party ? Dr. KRIEGER. That I honestly do not know.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you ever see an individual in his presence who was known to you to be a member of the Communist Party ? Dr. KRIEGER. No; not other than this Leo Cefkin whom I formerly mentioned to you and who I introduced to Witczak. Otherwise, these are people that I had met up there that I can-there were people that I had met who, since, I have completely forgotten. There was another man by the name of-I can't think of his name, offhand. I will try to think of it as we go along, but this one physicist, Clarence Fetterly, and this other man were the three I saw most often up there.
Mr. JACKSON. In your associations-to refer back to your associations, to the cell group of which you were a memberDr. KRIEGER. Yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. Can you identify for the committee by name any additional people who attended cell meetings with you during the period of time you were a member in the fifty-ninth assembly district cell of the Communist Party ? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir; I cannot, offhand. I can't recall any others, other than those that I originally mentioned or that I remembered as he read the names off. I can look it over, and if I can recall any-I will think it over and if I can recall any I will be glad to bring it to your attention.
Mr. JACKSON. Was your cell group ever addressed by party functionaries or other persons from outside the group? Dr. KRIEGER. Yes, sir. We were addressed at one time by a party functionary whose name I cannot recall. She was a woman, and she was something in the-I don't know whether she was county secretary, or something like that. I might know her name if I hear it, but I couldn't honestly say to that.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, did you meet anybody outside of your own group or cell that you knew to be members of the Communist Party ? Dr. KRIEGER. Let's see. I probably did, but I can't recall their names right offhand. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2107 
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first become aware that Sam Witczak was connected with an international apparatus? Dr. KRIEGER. He told me.
Mr. WHEELER. When did lie tell you that? Dr. KRIEGER. He told me right after I got out of the Air Corps when he wanted me to go to Japan. He told me just what he was.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you adhere to his beliefs? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, at. the time I was interested in communism and the general principles of. I suppose what you would term left-wing politics.
Mr. WHEELER. Tins wasn't exactly communism. As I recall the Canadian case, it related to espionage. Dr. KRIEGER. I knew nothing about the Canadian case at the time, you see, and he never asked me to do any actual espionage work. In other words, when he wanted me to go to Japan he asked me to go as a letter drop.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were you to forward the communications to; do you recall? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, it sounds very melodramatic and just like a movie, but he had given me complete instructions as to who, what, when, why when I got there, and after I was to arrive in Japan, after I was there a few days, I was to drop a post card to the Russian Embassy, and I don't recall offhand what it was to say, but I was to sign it with an "S" and they would know who it was. Then I was to wait, I think it was, another 4 or 5 days after that and go to a certain department store, up to the flower department in that department store and ask for a certain type of flower. There would be a man there who also would be interested in it, and he would come up and talk about it and ask about it, and that is how we would know, and then I was to walk out and he was to walk out and he was my contact. That is all that I knew at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. In other words, you were to receive communications from Witczak? Dr. KRIEGER. NO; I Was never to contact Witczak once I left the country.
Mr. WHEELER. You used the term "mail drop." From whom were you to receive the communications? Dr. KRIEGER. That I don't know. All I know is that he told me I was to be a letter drop and that I would get all my instructions from this particular person whom I met in Japan. (At this point Thomas W. Beale, Sr., assistant counsel to the committee, entered the conference room.)
Mr. WHEELER. Now, how did Sam Witczak identify himself to you after you got out of the Air Corps? You say he told you who he was? I mean, exactly what did he say ? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, all lie told me-when he told me what he wanted me to do I asked him what he was or who he was, and he told me he was Sam Witczak but that he was working for the Communist International at the time. He never wanted any connection between him and the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall when Witczak left Los Angeles? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, it was in 1945. I believe it was in September.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have any knowledge of the fact that he was fleeing the country, so to speak? 2108 COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY Dr. KRIEGER. No; none whatsoever.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, by you agreeing with Witczak in this maildrop operation, did you realize at that time that you were also becoming a part of a conspiratorial group or becoming involved with the Communist International? Dr. KRIEGER. I did.
Mr. WHEELER. And you were agreeable to that ? Dr. KRIEGER. I was at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever receive any money from Mr. Witczak ? Dr. KRIEGER. I did.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the money for? Dr. KRIEGER. For passage to Japan.
Mr. WHEELER. Passage to Japan ? Dr. KRIEGER. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever receive any other money? Dr. KRIEGER. Which I, by the way, subsequently returned to him.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever act as a mail drop in the United States, or did you everDr. KRIEGER. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. -Transmit any communications of any nature? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Witczak ever request any information from you while you were in the United States Air Corps? Dr. KRIEGER. No; not while I wasin the Air Corps.
Mr. WHEELER. Did he request any information from you at all? Dr. KRIEGER. He did.
Mr. WHEELER. What type of information ? Dr. KRIEGER. He wanted-about a year afterward he wanted to know whether I would write in a detailed account for him of what -transpired during my training as a cadet, and I told him at the time that it was available in the city hall, that I thought there was a recruiting depot up there and they had all the literature of what a cadet went through.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you supply him this information? Dr. KRIEGER. I did.
Mr. WHEELER. In pamphlet form from the city hall? Dr. KRIEGER. No. He asked me-when I told him that he asked me to please write it, myself, and write it out so that-whether he felt that I could leave out or put in or write more detail, I do not know, but I practically, as I recall, took one of those pamphlets and wrote from it what the expected training was of a cadet, plus what happened to me as a cadet, and that was all.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this in any way considered restricted or classified information ? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir; it was not. It was public information.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know what Mr. Witczak did with the material? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir; I do not.
Mr. WHEELER. What was his reaction when he received them? Dr. KeIEGER. Nothing. He thanked me and said that he was going to report to his superiors, or whatever it was, and try and get me back in their good graces, and I told him that I didn't care to. That was all. COMMUNISM IN HOLLYWOOD MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY 2109 
Mr. WHEELER. Did he ever mention to you who his superiors were? Dr. KRIEGER. No; other than that he took orders directly from the Kremlin.
Mr. WHEELER. Well how do you feel about this whole experience now? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, pretty rotten. You must know.
Mr. WHEELER. You had no prior knowledge that Witezak was going to flee the country at all? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir; I did not; none whatsoever.
Mr. WHEELER. But you entered into this venture well knowing what you were undertaking at the time? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, I can't really say that I well knew what I was going to get into, but I had an idea.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Mr. Witezak's wife? Dr. KRIEGER. I did, very well.
Mr. WHEELER. What was her name ? Dr. KRIEGER. Bunia, B-u-n-i-a.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she involved in this same thing that Mr. Witczak was? Dr. KRIEGER. Well, now, that is a hard thing for me to honestly answer you. Obviously she knew what was going on. She knew what her husband was doing, and so forth, but whether she, herself, did anything, that I cannot honestly say.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Witczak ever discuss with you what type of information he was interested in? Dr. KRIEGER. No, sir; he did not.

He wore an Adolphe Menjou-type mustache, and he wore pince-nez glasses on occasion, and his build was a medium build-probably about-well, around, I would imagine, 5 feet 10 or thereabouts, to the best of my knowledge.

Mr. JACKSON. Yes. Dr. KRIEGER. I know that they attended--certain members would attend certain gatherings where, I believe, information was to be brought back to us. However, any dynamic political action by the cell itself was not taken as such.

Mr. WHEELER. What is your height Dr. KRIEGER. What is my what?
Mr. WHEELER. Height. Dr. KRIEGER. My height?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. Dr. KRIEGER. About 5 feet 7. 
Mr. WHEELER. The Bureau knows who the Korean is, then, in other words? Dr. KRIEGER. I believe so.

Mr. JACKSON. Or of any other persons who were known to you to be members of the Communist Party, outside of the cell organization ? Dr. KRIEGER. No; not right offhand, I cannot, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. If the names of any additional individuals occur to you, will you get in touch with Mr. Wheeler? Dr. KRIEGER. I will. I will be more than happy to.
Mr. JACKSON. Or in the absence of Mr. Wheeler, will you communicate that information to the committee? Dr. KRIEGER. I will.
Mr. JACKSON. Is there any reason why the doctor should not be excused at this time?
Mr. WHEELER. I see no reason why not. I think his subpena should be continued open, unless you want to set a date. I assume, or go on the presumption that the full committee will be very interested in taking the testimony from the doctor.
Mr. JACKSON. Of course, I have no authority to vacate the subpena pending the arrival of a full committee in Los Angeles, so the subpena will be continued open.
Mr. WHEELER. Make it Friday morning at 9: 30.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. Why don't you leave it open, then. If you ever want him, just call me and I will be glad to produce him for you.
Mr. JACKSON. Let's put it on that basis. The subpena will be continued open. If, for any reason, you anticipate changing your address or being absent from the city during the course of the public hearings, will you communicate that information to Mr. Wheeler? Dr. KRIEGER. I will; yes, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. In order that we will be able to call you if it is the desire of the committee. Dr. KRIEGER. Yes.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. If Mr. Wheeler will give me a ring I will produce him for you.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Fine. Thank you. (A discussion was had off the record.)
Mr. JACKSON. One further question on the record. Have you communicated your identities to the press or not?
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. Yes; they got us out there.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, I didn't want to inadvertently give that information in the event that you had not already so identified yourself.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. We got here about a quarter of 10. We tried to sit up at the other end, but you just can't avoid them.
Mr. JACKSON. It is very difficult to do.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. Some of them knew who I was. I don't think they have identified him with that Canadian deal.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, as far as any information that will be given out from this committee on this hearing, there will be none except to possibly distinguish between those who cooperated with the committee and those who did not: so pending any further word from us, thank you very much. Dr. KRIEGER. Thank you.
Mr. ARNOLD KRIEGER. Thank you, gentlemen.
