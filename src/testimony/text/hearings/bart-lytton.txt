I asked you who made that statement to you and you said Mr. George Beck. Now, the expression that you made about the necessity of clearing up of this matter else your name would be "Mud" in this community has been interpreted in some sources as having constituted a threat on the part of George Beck as it means or a weapon to compel you to come into the party. If that is true, I want you to state so clearly, and if it isn't true, if that isn't the correct interpretation of your testimony, I would like for you to clarify that.
Mr. L-rrov . Well, George Beck is about as threatening as the St. Louis Browns. No, sir, George Beck was not threateiiing me. I didn't take it as a threat. I took it quite differently at the time and I would again conclude today that his purpose was not, to threaten me, Mr. Tavenner. His purpose was to advise me. That was the manner in which he approached it and that is the manner in which he handled it straight firough, because more than tlat occurred.

Mr. CJJARY. But you generally find a red taint in connection with tile use of that word by that person; do you not I
Mr. Lyvrox. Well, I didn't know that the people referred specifically to a conspiracy. I can only say that to le it clearly is evidence of a feeling of conspiracy.

Mr. TAVfENNER. As a result of the various experiepces that you had In Hollywood, after you arrived here, did you finally unite with the Communist Party again? Air. Lrr.N. Well, let me continue In regard to the last question and this question, because we have a basic continuity there. I want to reiterate, so there is no question about it, that George Beck didn't threaten me. (leorge Beck was counseling me to the best of his knowledge and belief that this is what would happen. I think that. George Beck would corrloborite at any time that he said it to me and that he advised me to handle the matter by clearing these charges up. Ho pointed out at the time that if charges like this were bandied about, that not only the members of the Coinmunist Party, but that liberals and nanny people who had no particular politics would hear vatgute and disturbing things about me, or perhaps specific things, and that they would then consider me anathema, to their to their way of living or their principles or anything else. And he felt that the waves of such a reaction could be disastrous to my career and to my sense of well-being, because my first response was "Oh, chuck it; I am not going to do anything about it." After several conversations on the matter, I had to conclude it was important. I was angry about it, and ns more came to me my anger mounted. It was based on no facts. It was based on neither evidence nor what proved later to be factual, so I began to set to work with a will. I was put in contact with an Elizaheth Glenn. 1 was given to understand that she was in a membership capacity in the Coxmunist Party in Hollywood.
Mr. TAvENNER. Did site have another name at that time, to your knowledge?
Mr. Lrrow. You know, I may have given the wrong name there. Is it LeechI
Mr. TAvvNNmR. Our information is she was known at different times by both of those names, Glenn and Leech.
Mr. LyTToN. I see. I don't recall. I know I have heard both references, and I don't know her. I was put in contact with her by Beck, and she reviewed the story with me. She told me that there were a number of charges leveled against me in New York. I had done everything, apparently, but set fire to my mother. She stated that I had been expelled from the party, according to the best of their knowledge, and that I had been considered as unreliable, a provocateur-a term frequently bandied about-and that I had stolen a typewriter from the Communist Party headquarters and had pawned same, and that I had deserted the party. The party likes faithful lovers and many other things. I don't even recall them all: Now, if she said that I deserted the party, I said, "Well, this is true." But as to the typewriter incident, there was no truth in it whatsoever. As to having been expelled, as far as I knew there was no truth in it whatsoever, and presented the charges. I asked her what I could do about it. Well, it didn't seem that I could do very much about it. I asked her if there was such a thing as a hearing. She said, well they take care of it in their own way. She said she would correspond with New York. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANORLEB AREA 448 I said, "Well, you ought to know something next week." She said, "No, it will be longer than that." Many months went by and- I became more and more agitated, because now a process began. People previously friendly to me were no longer friendly. I would arrange to have dinner with friends, my wife and I, and at the lost minute the dinner date would be canc4ed. I would walk into gild meethgM and backs would be turned if I went to enter the conversations avid I became very agitated at this. It is not pleasant, and I still didn't fully understand it. I understood the emanation of it. I meant to say that I wits not equipped to handle it at this time. It therefore became a struggle on my part, I should say, and a very important one, to clear these particular charges. I wasn't concerned at that time with the issue of the Communist Party. I was concerned with the fact that apparently a rumor factory and a very competent rumor factory wts at work. Ohe incident brought it into its sharpest focus. I had been a proliflic provider of material for USO camp shows. As a matter of fact, I believe, I was told by the USO that I wrote more camp show material than auy other writer in the United States, and was commended by them for that. Some of my sketches had played to as many, I wits told, as 6 million meni. It seemed like an awful lot to me. And I doubted it, but nevertheless I knew they were played to many, many Army camps and installations throughout-where tightinF forces were stationed. rilhe USO w~as trying to .get comedy material unslanted, and they arranlgedl at the Screen Writers' Guild-not the Screen Writers' Guild, the 11ollywood Writers' 11obilization-to have an evening in which theT would showv the kind of material that they wanted. 'I hey gave me what was to the Communist the kiss of death. It shows my material as unslanted material. That evening Carole Landis and Fay McKenzie and Ed Lorre who ran USO camp shows, entertainment division came down together with others--I don't recall whom-to the ollywood-Roosevelt Hotel, and they played these sketches. Now, this one sketch was the forerunner of a type of sketch that has become tiresome enough since. It was a psychiatric sketch. At the time there hadn't been psychiatrist sketches of this character. It was a very funny sketch, and it had played already with teams taking it out and stars requesting to take it out, even though it had ben old material by this time, they still wanted to take it out to military installations. The sketch was played, and most of the writers present sat on their hands. They didn't laugh, they didn't applaud, they didn't like it. This was rather unusual, in view of the fact that by that time several hundred thousand American 01's had laughed their heads off at the sketch. And these were supposed to be judges of material. It was brought in because it was to be the top laugh producer that the USO had in its repertoire. They sat on their hanas, and I was deeply agitated by this. I began to feel by this time that I was involved in a crusade. I hadn't done what was charged. The feelings at that time were not political; they were personal. I wanted to clear a name and be able to work again and work in peace. 444 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TILE LOS ANGELES AREA I don't know how many months ensued. It dissolves, as you sy in motion-picture terminology. But lots of time elapsed. In the course of this time I did everything that I know to do to clear the so-called charges. Subsequently I was engad to do a documentary fl m by Prince. ton Film Center, the Rockefeller Foundation subsidizing it, in Gloucester, Mass., on war shipbuilding. I wont up there and did the film and came back through Now York. In New York I went to Communist Party headquarters on 13th Street, and I told them my story. I told them that there was this story extant on the west coast, that it wasn't true, and I wanted them to produce for me any records which indicated any truth in these particular charges. q I also said to them, "If these charges are true, would you have a record I" They said, "Oh, certainly, we would. If the charges are true, believe me, we will have them.I About a half hour passed and a girl came to me who introduced herself as an organization secretary, I believe, I don't recall. In sviy event, I was taken to another floor. I waited some more. 8he came back down and told me, "Not only are there no charges against you, but somebody up stairs knew you who says you are a md hty fine fellow." She said, "No; we have no record whatsoevere and, therefore there wouldn't be any truth in these charges." I said, "Well, they seem to believe it in the West." She said, "Well, that is pretty far away. What do you want us to do about it I" I said, "For heaven's sake, lot them know that these charges are untrue and tell them to stop their rumor factory." She said, "We will be very glad to." I appreciated that. I came back to the coast. I got in touch with the same people. No word from New York. More time went on months. Finally, apparently there was word from New York. I aon't know what oiircuitous routes it took, whether it came out by carrier pigeons or how, but, in any event, apparently the word came out at that time that I was cleared in New York and that the charges were groundless. This Elizabeth Leech Glenn again contacted me and told me that I was cleared and they regretted very much the fact that I had been so badly treated as a result of It, she was sorry, and she sent a rather inept public-relations officer, I might say, to see me at my home, who explained that in revolutionary situations the innocent must die with the guilty, it is just too bad. "We are sorry, fellow, that this hap. pened to you. We are sorry that for a year and a half now," or a year, whatever the time was, "we understand, it is awful," she said. "Once up in Michigan the same thing happened to me, I was called a renegade," she said, "a Trotskyite, and some kind of deviationist." She said, "I lived through that, and I know what it is and I understand," and so forth. "And it is too bad, but you mustn't have any ill feeling toward the party. You must understand it. You must be a Bolshevik."
Mr. TAvrsmm. Do you recall the name of the emissary that came to see you I COMMUNIST ACTIVITIPA IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 445 
Mr. Ln rox. Her name and her face blotted out from my memory, I think instantly. I found it itparticularly painful interview, I didn't like it.; I was tincoinfortable and tlnhappy about it. I have novel, seen her before or since. I can only state that sho stated site was from Michigan. More than that I do not know. As a matter of fact, she didn't give me a name. I might make that point clear, Mr. Tavenner. People are not necessarily intro. duced to each other formally in tile Communist Party, and first names are often used. You will learn a name, but you are not necessarily brought up to itperson and someone doesn't say "Comrade So-andSo, meet Cotnlrado So-and-So." It isn't done th1is way, at least in this short experience that I had. So I don't know who sihe was.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, may I a4sk a question itthis point? . I
Mr. VE,.,. Yes.
Mr. JACKsON. YoU were told dutrin the ciurise of this interview that in the process of itrevolution the innocent sometimes had to stiffer along with the guilty. Did that strike you as being inconsistent with the party line as it generally operates? This hysterical cry of smear that you hear from the Commuists, from tile fellow-traieling press, this hysterical dentnciation of committees of this kind, simply beeau tiii tile course of tile investigation sometimes, as happened yesterday, an innocent name is mentioned, which the committee attempts on all occasions to correct immediately, but, still this cry goes on, "(m.uil by asso(eiltion, Faseists, witehhunting, everyred baiting," were, according to yoir statement, they accept its day practice tile fact that a lot of innocent people are going to get hurt during this revolutionary period. This seems to me to be itvery glaring inconsistency in what they say and what they practice. That is not a question. It is simply an observation, because it made a marked impression on me. The comrades talk out of one side of their mouth about one thing, and out of the other about something else.
Mr. Lyr'roN. Well, Congressman Jackson, for a long time I wanted to say, "I dig you, Jackson," Laughter.]
Mr. VFtmWE. May we be Inorder, please.
Mr. Ly'roN. I would say if you.are trying to pinpoint one incon. sistency to the Communist Party, it might take us longer than your terms in Congress to pinpoint all the inconsistencies in thie Communist Party and its line.
Mr.JACKsoN. Tie committee has been working for many years to pinpoint a few of them. However, this is an important one.
Mr. LYrroN. I think so. I think it is a very important one. You and I are of a different political stripe. I am a Democrat and you are a Republican.
Mr. JACKsON. That is the hallmark of America.
Mr. LYTroN. Nonetheless, we can sit and discuss our differences, and we have; not you and 1,but a couple of Republicans have with me, and other Democrats.
Mr. CAtry. We haven't had any differences up to date.

For example, it writer named flai're Lyn(ifon wasli writing it picture "I Mfaried atCommunist." I am not Barre Ljyndonl and lie was writitig an antti-Communlilist )icture. It was charged that. Blart Lytton wrote it. My wife was called ald dsho was cursed utp and(down roundly by at former friend. She wats told(, "Dont't you believe thaft hie isn't writing it.

An interesting 0o18 to me was one wvhere a producer, whom I did not know had expressed keen interest in it story I had wriittenl. I was invite to the studio to see thsIrdcra lwn to tlte studio, RRO, again, and the producer wvas Adrian Scott. When hie saw who thle writer was lie apparently didn't like it, let uts put it that way. Hie delivered me a stern lectur on fascism and dismissed me curtly without discussion of thle story. I was to be hired by Abe Burrows to write specialty material for him. I met him ait his request at the Brown Derby on Vine Street. He said, "Gee, I have decided I don't need a specialty writer. I don't need a writer." And lie turned around and walked ou't on an invitation to lunch. 41201 COMNIlST ACTIVITIES IN THP, LOS ANOBLES AREIA This kind of incidents kept oevirring. Wherever I turned I was astounded that while the party was notJarge, they had as inany areas of Influence as the had in Hollywood. Made several attempts to have a hearing on he matter. I didn't want to get back in the Coinmtuust Party. I wanted no part of It. I had learned everything I had to learn about Itand everything it represented, but I wanted a hearing because I wanted to be confronted with any evidence that might exist, and I wanted to mio what they had to say. I was never afforded a hearing. I was never afforded any opportunity. I was told, "We don't have to give you a hearing. We don't have to listen to you. We know what you are." I asked who told then those things, and they said, "That is our business," and so forth. The feeling there was simply that I was guilty because I was seen with an Army officer who was known to be an Intelligence officer. The Army officer was my brother. He wits a captain in the field artillery.
Mr. thAoKsON. So that was guilt by association. 
Mr. L mN. Yes, sir; guilt by association.
Mr. JACKsoN. Isn't that a very relrehensible thing in the Communist Party parlance I
Mr. LrroN. I think"gtuilt by association" isgenerally rerelensible and I think the Communists have very poor grace in ever accusing anyone else of it.
Mr. fAc.KsoiN. Except for the fact that a bank cashier who travels around with thugs and holdup men. He doesn't hold his job very long, does heV
Mr. LrrroN. I don't know what you mean.
Mr. JACKSON. That would be guilt by association. 
Mr. LrrroN. I see what you mean; yes, that is right.
Mr. JACKSON. But the Communists do practice guilt by association.
Mr. LyrtoN. Most assuredly they do. There is no question about that.
Mr. CL.,wy. Of course, they never assassinate anybody's character. 
Mr. Lrrro. They did their darndest to assassinate mine. Well, let us put it this way: I was no longer welcome in any of the circles I previously knew. People would not talk to me about it. The very nice people to whom [-am indebted for my appearance here today, Pauline and Leo Townsend, I went to, because I had seen them at a meeting, and I asked them what it was about, and at that time they weren't out of the decompression chamber and they.appeared nervous and ill at ease about the matter, and said that I had- better talk to somebody else. They were the only people, incidentally, who would even speak to me about it Others just simply turned their backs.
Mr. Dou. You mean that only Communists who would talk to youI
Mr. Lrrror. No, sir; I wouldn't sy-I will put it a little strong than "only Communists." I would may that tfe Reds have a lot of fellow travelers, as you know, and you get to know pretty well who the fellow travelers are or you would my, "Well, mabe ti s j1uo is a Communist. I don't know whlmt be is a Communist rar member but I know he is a Cummunkt or i fellow traveler." The allow travelers, in turn. have influence at concentric circles, influence upon liberals, we will may, and this gwes on. Now, they t COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN TIE LOS ANOELES AItRA 453 didn't care what they said and they said many things that had no hasis in fact whatsoever.
Mr. CLARDY. What you are trying to say is that they are the most intolerant people on earth.
Mr. LrroN. Tolerance is not even considered to be a virtue in the Communist Party, according to its teachings. 
Mr.CLAIIDY. You are agreeing with me, then, I take it?
Mr. LyrroN. Most assuredly.
Mr. TAVrNNF.R Well, as a result of your experience in the Com- munist Party, you left the field of screen writing; is that what I understandI
Mr. Lnrov. Well, let us say that it was certainly a large contributing factor. I was unable to secure another job in town. I had the interesting experience, incidentally, of being told by a couple of producers tlt I was a known Communist. I said, "1low did you learn that I" And he said, "Well, your name was dropped by a couple of people I know to be Communists." This was in that period. In other words, if it was necessary to state that I was a Communist not to get a job, they would do it that way.
Mr. DoYl,. May I ask this question Y
Mr. VEWE. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DoYi, I hope you will see the pertinence of my question, sir. 1p until the time of .your trouble with the Communist Party leadership, as a sc een writer you had been financially successful?
Mr. LJrroN. I certainly had.
Mr. ID)oYL. Thank you.
Mr. TAvFNqNER. You mentioned the name of Mr. Stanley Praeger. Will you spell that for me?
Mr. LrrorN. P-r-a-e-g-e-r0 I believe.
Mr. TAvzNNzr. What is his occupation-what was it at that time?
Mr. L0row. Oh, he was a road show Lou Costello. That is what you call a poor man's comic. lie used to appear at all social affairs ana do skets and skitches-"skets and skitches," that is interesting. And he was, I think, for a time employed at Twentieth Century-Fox a a comedian.
Mr. TAvZNNrYJ. Since the time of your withdrawal from the Coinmunist Party or your expulsion, have you engaged in any Conuntuist Party activities, to your knowledge I
Mr. Lrrrmo. No, sir. In the decompression period, which we will speak of again, I supported Henry Wallace in 1948 in his candidacy for the Piesidency of the United States, before the campaign and during part of it, fut before the campaign was over however, I didn't like the associations that it required and I ceased that support. I voted for him, however.
Mr. TAvzWUL I believe, Mr. Chairman, that is all I desire to ask.
Mr. Vaw& Mr. Jackson.
Mr.JACISOX. Your contention, as I unlermtand it, Mr. Lytton, is that as a result of you bretk with tho party that you wveri m turn, reviled and blackliied by these with whom you hd ptWriosy be aiwiociated !

I join heartily in thanking 3Ol for coming ad exposing the colispiracy which you ilid and the mnlner in whieli you did iL And in cOnlnee, tion with that eompliItent to you, T wish,'Mr. Chairman, to say while I do not have more than just personal aequaintance with the counsel now sitting beside the witness, lie had with him yesterday a very able, distinguished attorney, who lives in my old congressional district in Los Angeles County, andlI want to comIipliment him, and the partner here today, counsel for this witness, as men of the bar, successful as they are, taking time to come to this sort of a proceeding and add dignity and patriotic attitude by the bar toward the United States Congress. . Before I close, Mr. Chairman, I have received so many requests; both orally here and over the phone, and by messenger, where people are asking under what basic law this committee functions. I have had four quesions to that effect this morning.
