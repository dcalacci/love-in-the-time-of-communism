Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Hubley, this committee began its investigation of Communist activities-that is, Communist infiltration into the COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5811 entertainment field-back in March 1951, and it has been engaged constantly since that time in making investigations in that field. It has come to the attention of the committee that there was a group of artists, some of them being in the cartoonist field, and Eeing employed at Walt Disney Studios, who met as a group of Commulist Party members. Some of thes-e homes in which the meetings were held were said to be the homes of William Pomerance, Edward Biberman, and others. According to the information that came to the committee through sworn testimony, it appeared that at some of these meetings the question of the use of arts was fully discussed from the viewpoint of having art to carry a particular message as distinguished from the practice of art for art's sake. Our purpose in calling you here today, as part of our investigation into tlis field, is to inquire as to what knowledge you have, if any, of such meetings. Let me ask you first, Were you acquainted with Edward Biberman?
Mr. IIUBLEY. Well, in answer to your question, Mr. Tavenner, I would like to state that I feel that in the area of politics and in the area associations, workwise or social, that I do not feel personally that your committee should ask me to reveal or speak on these matters, either with my opinions or my associations.
Mr. TAVENNER. By that do you mean that you decline to answer the question ? Air. IHu LEY. Well, I would mean that I do not considerMr. TAVENN ER. You are expressing a reason why you would prefer not to answer the question, but you have not clearly stated whether or not you are merely raising an objection or whether you are actually refusing to answer the question. \fr. HURLEY. Well, I am raising an objection to the line of questioning in the sense that I do not agree that it is a proper question for a person such as myself to be asked.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, I suggest that a substantive question be put to the witness in order that we may clarify this matter. 
Mr. TAVENNER. My question was whether or not this witness knew Edward Biberman. In view of the witness' statement, I think that it is perfectly proper to direct that lie answer.
Mr. DoYLF. I might state this to the witness, that the committee does not feel that in asking that question, that we are going into the field of your political beliefs. Under Public Law 601, we are directed by Congress to go into any field in which it appears that there is infiltration by Soviet communism, whether it is in art, music, literature, government, or labor, or the legal profession. That is the basis of this question. We have not, and we will not, go into your political beliefs. We cannot accept your objection as a valid answer to the question. So that my duty as subcommittee chairman is, in view of that fact, to instruct you to answer the question, because an objection is not a declining to answer, as we see it. I do instruct you to answer the question, whatever your answer may be.
Mr. iluBLE. Well, since the question was framed within the reference to political activities, and also associations, I choose to invoke my constitutional privilege under the first amendment and under the fifth amendment. 5812 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. DOYLE. This committee recognizes the invoking of those privileges as entirely proper where conscientiously used. Vr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, is it not the view of the committee that it recognizes the fifth amendment may be a valid reason for refusing to answer a question of that type, but the first amendment would not be?
Mr. DOYLE. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been acquainted with William Pomerance?
Mr. HuBLEY. May I consult counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Surely. (Witness consulted his counsel.)
Mr. HUBLEY. Since you, in your previous questioning have referred to Mr. Pomerance in a certain connection, I decline on the same -grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with David Hilberman?
Mr. HuiLEY. Yes; I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where was Hilberman employed during the period you were employed by the Walt Disney Studios?
Mr. HUBLEY. As I recall, Hilberman was employed at the Walt Disney Studio around 1940.
Mr. McNULTY. Mr. Chairman, may I just talk with the witness at ,this time?
Mr. DOYLE. You may confer with your client at any time. (Witness consulted his counsel.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Was David Hilberman known to you to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. HUBLEY. This is a similar question, Mr. Counsel, to the other one and I have already stated my intention, I think, rather clearly on questions of this kind.
Mr. DOYLE. We cannot accept that as a satisfactory answer to the question. If you mean by your answer that you plead your constitutional privilege to this question, the same as you did the previous one, then I suggest you make it clear that you plead your constitutional privilege if that is consistent with your counsel's advice to you. But, the form of your answer is not satisfactory to the committee; that is what I am saying to you. (Witness consulted his counsel.)
Mr. HUBLEY. It is consistent with my counsel's advice and also with my own conscience and advice that I invoke the rights under the constitution in all questions of this kind.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you refuse to answer the question that I asked you on the ground of the fifth amendment?
Mr. HUBLLT. The first and fifth amendments.
Mr. TAVENNER. I say, do you?
Mr. HuBLEY. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I just wanted the record to show plainly what your position is. Are you acquainted with Bernyce Polifka Fleury?
Mr. HuBLEY. Yes, sir. I worked with her from time to time in various capacities in the studios.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she employed at the Walt Disney Studio at the time that you were?
Mr. HUBLEY. I honestly do not recall that she was employed at the Disney Studio. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5813 
Mr. TAVENNEE. Do you recall where she was employed?
Mr. HUBLEY. I believe she worked at Warner Bros., and I believe she worked at UPA.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she known to you to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. HUBLEY. I must decline again on the grounds previously stated. 
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend any meeting of the Communist Party at which Ed Biberman and David Hilberman and Bernyce Fleury, or any one of them was present?
Mr. HuBLEY. I decline on the grounds of the first and fifth amendments to discuss any kind of associations.
Mr. Mc ULTT. Mr. Chairman, may I ask that if possible counsel might make it somewhat definite, any meetings and what period he had in mind?
Mr. TAvERNER. My question is whether you attended one at any time?
Mr. McNuLTY. Then the answer will stand, I take it.
Mr. TAVERNER. Will you answer the question now?
Mr. HUBLEY. I decline on constitutional grounds to discuss this type of question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you aware of the existence of an organized group of the Communist Party made up principally of artists from the cartoonist and painters' field while you were in Hollywood prior to your entry into the Armed Forces of the United States? (Witness consulted his counsel.)
Mr. HRLEy. Well, it is a question regarding politics and I will stand on the same grounds as previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. HJJLEY. I would reply on the same grounds to that question or a question of whether I was a Democrat, Republican, or anything else. 
Mr. TAVENNER. I was afraid that that was your conception, probably, of the Communist Party, when you spoke of politics. It has long been demonstrated by testimony before this committee over by periods of time, and it has been demonstrated by findings of fact the Congress of the United States, and by the Federal courts that the Communist Party is not a political party in the sense that we underfor instance, stand the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, to be political parties. you will not or So, that may alter your decision as to whether political answer these questions if we make it plain to you it is not a be a conspiratorial party. The Communist Party has been held to apparatus, and it is not a political party. With that explanation, will you change your replies?
Mr. HULEy. I think it is still a matter of opinion, legal or otherwise. party the
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, because you consider it a politicalto testify? you refuse Party, Republican or Democratic a as same (Witness consulted his counsel.) on all grounds.
Mr. HURLEY. I decline to answer that question asserted by you?
Mr. TAVERNER. On the grounds previously
Mr. IIHULEY. Yes. Party while
Mr. TAVERNER. Were you a member of the Communist living in Hollywood? it seems to me, and
Mr. HUeLET. This is the same form of question, I will invoke the constitutional privileges again. 5814 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Jackson, do you have any questions?
Mr. JACKsON. I think not, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DoYLE. I have one. We have evidence from other witnesses who were at one time menibers of the Communist conspiracy, artists and painters, and so forth, from Hollywood and other places. At times their artistical interests were directed in order to put across a certain message sponsored by Soviet communism, rather than art for art's sake. That, of course, is one of the purposes of this question, fundamentally to see if we can get your help, as an artist, to understand the extent, if in your experience, communism tried or succeeded in directing your specialized talents to put across a certain communistic message rather than art for art's sake. I am making that statement to you as one man to another because ourfield as your Congressman is to try to discover ways in which that was done, and from your experience if at all, learn how Congress may undertake to more intelligently and efficiently legislate or handle the problem. That is not politics, it is art. I want to ask you very frankly, in the field of art, if you can help us understand or learn in what way, the Communists sought, through your talented ability to influence a message other than just for art's sake? Is that . fair question toyou?
Mr. HUBLEy. I have a lot of opinions about art a well as I am sure all artists do and it is an endless discussion and I do not think that this would serve purpose here. I would like to simply say in answer to that, that I have 30 years of creative work and that I stand on that. It is public work, and anyone is welcome to examine it and to look at it, and I stand on my work, and not on my opinions. My opinions can change, and I have changed them many times, all through my life, and I like the right we have to be able to change them. But the'work stands. I have no shame about it. If anyone wants to examine it, it is there.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, did you feel that any of your creative work was the result of the infiltration or influence or the pressures or the promulgation of the Communist influence in Hollywood? Did you reproduce any creative work in whole or in part as a result of any Communist infiltration in your own consciousness? TNr. HuELEY. My work has been my own work, and my own talent, and my own opinions.
Mr. DoYLE. Was that work influenced by Communist pressure directly or indirectly? Was your creative work a result of your opinion which was shaped in whole or in part by the influence of communism which you may have been surrounded in whole or in part?
Mr. HUBLEY. There are many influences on every person, and the ones on me were many, and I do not know. Your question is not very specific. As I told you, when you are discussing Communist ideas, I no not believe it is the proper kind of a question here, and I have declined to state opinions or otherwise in this area. That is on constitutional grounds. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5815 
Mr. DOYLE. I am always disappointed as a Member of Congress and a fellow citizen when a person such as you with particular creative ability, does not take the opportunity to help your Congress understand more in detail the extent to which communism has infiltrated in your particular art or craft. I aim just stating that to you as one man to another. It is again a case where I recognize a great creative ability, and of course, we would not be calling you this morning if we did not have an idea, a rather definite idea, that you could help us.
Mr. HrBLEn. Well, I would like to say, and it may be a help or not, that this creative ability that you recognize can only flourish in a climate of complete freedom and complete free ability to explore and to think and to experiment.
Mr. Don=a. We have abundant testimony by former active Communists in your field, in the field of music and in the field of literature that they do not have or did not experience, while they were members of the Communist group, complete freedom. That is one of the things that we are try ing to understand, so that we can help protect our Nation more thoroughly against the infiltration and the taking away of complete freedom.
Mr. JAcKsoN. I have several questions to ask to clear the record. Of course, I think that there is an abundance of testimony that indicates that anyone who is in the Communist Party as an artist had absolutely no freedom, and he was in a mental philosophical straitjacket. However, there is sworn testimony before the committee that you were in fact a member of the Communist Party. Is that testimony true or false?
Mr. HUBLEY. I decline to answer the question.
Mr. JACKSON. The testimony also indicates that you attended closed meetings of the Communist Party. Is that testimony true or false?
Mr. HuBLY. I decline to answer on the previous grounds.
Mr. JACKsoN. Did you contribute your talents in any way to the Communist Party or the Communist-front organizations?
Mr. HuBLEY. I decline to answer.
Mr. JACKSON. For the reasons previously stated?
Mr. HUBLEY. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you contribute funds to the Communist Party, directly or indirectly, or to any Communist-front organization?
Mr. H-ELEY. I decline to answer.
Mr. JAcKsoN. Are you today a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. HULE . This question is again, I feel, the same kind of infringement that the others were, and I invoke the privilege of the first and the fifth amendments.
Mr. JACKSON. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman. But I move the release of the testimony of the witness, subject to the will of the full committee.
Mr. DoYL. Let the record so show. Are there any other questions?
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no other questions.
Mr. DovrE. Thank you, Mr. Counsel, and the witness. (Thereupon, at 12 10 p. in., Thursday, July 5, 1956, the executive hearing of the witness adjourned.) INDEX INDIVIDUALS Aland, William ----------------------------------------------------Page 5776-5782, 5785 5787 Altman, Mischa5785 5781, 5779, Altman, M rs.
