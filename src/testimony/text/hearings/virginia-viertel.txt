Mrs. VIETEL. Virginia Viertel.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you represented by counsel? Misr. VIERTEL. Yes; Mr. Martin Gang.
Mr. DOYLE. Will counsel state his name for the record?
Mr. GANG. Martin Gang, 6400 Sunset Boulevard.
Mr. WREELER. Where were you born, Mrs. Viertel?
Mr. VCERTEL. Beaver, Pa., September 3, 1915. you relate your educational background?
Mr. WHEELER. Would
Mrs. VIERTEL. I went to Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, and then years later I went 1 year at USC and 1 year at UCLA.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your occupation? right now.
Mrs. VTTRTEL. Editor it has been. Nothing the motion picture
Mr. "HEELER. Are you referring to an editor in industry?
Mrs. VSEERTEL. Mostly not. released by the committee August 7, 1956. ,Odered 5789 5790 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Mostly not? Then in what field?
Mrs. VIERTs. In books. Book publishing.
Mr. WHEELER. You are appearing before the subcommittee at your own request; is that correct?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. I believe you know that you have been identified as a member of the Communist Party by witnesses before the committee?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Communist Party? Yes; I was.
Mrs. ViERT.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you please state when you first joined the Communist Party?
Mrs. VrsRTEL. Yes. It isn't entirely easy, but I think it was 1936 or thereabouts.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you terminate that membership?
Mrs. VIERTEL. That, too, is not exactly a definite date, but it was certainly erratic after 1940; but I know that after-during 1945 I never saw anybody again. That was the final end.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you previously married to Budd Schulberg?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When did the marriage terminate in divorce?
Mrs. VIERTEL. In 1944, 1 think. Is that right?
Mr. GANe. You separated in 1942.
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe you said you separated in 1942, were di- vorced in 1944.
Mrs. VIsRTEL. 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. I want the record clear.
Mr. GAN . Make the record clear, would you?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Oh, yes. We separated in 1942 and were divorced in 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. May the record show that you were divorced in January of 1944?
Mrs. VIERTL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was your membership in the Communist Party during the entire period of your marriage to Mr. Schulberg?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. I was a member the whole time; but, as I say, we often went away and we weren't in constant attendance.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you state your constant attendance, then, in the Communist Party, if you possibly can? When did you start to draw away from membership-become disinterested?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Oh, I should say in 1939. We had some small quarrels and things in 1938 and 1939, really, but I guess in 1940, that wasI don't think we attended meetings regularly ever again.
Mr. WHEELER. After 1940?
Mrs. VirRan. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. But you still retained your membership to a later date ?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes, but it really didn't matter. It is hard; I know it seems strange, but membership one didn't think about. That was a rather loose-it was unimportant.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay Communist Party dues during the entire time of your membership? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5791 
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. Mine were nominal dues. Housewife dues. Fifty cents or a dollar.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you completely divorce yourself from the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIRa'I'L. Well, completely in 1945.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask, up until what time did you pay dues?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Well, I imagine until 1940, because after that I did not go to regular meetings. I was not a regular member.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you tell the subcommittee, please, the reasons you joined the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. It is really very simple, because we had just been through the depression and it hit most of us quite hard-if not us, because we were so young, we saw what happened, and we thought there must be economic reasons for this, and we all wanted to study and find out about it. It was bewildering to young people to have suddenly the whole world that we knew sort of crash, and then just on the humanitarian level, the unemployed, and the people were going through such hardships. That marks young people, I think, very much. It would take a very calloused young person not to respond some way. Then we were--and we responded in the only way we knew how, because we were intellectuals, so we studied and tried to find out about it. Then we were certainly anti-Fascist, and no other organization or group seemed to be doing anything about this at that time. There was nothing that one could-a young person could go to say, at least for guidance. Not even church groups. The Communist Party held out the only knowledge-when up in Imperial Valley, for example, where the poor were starving. Nobody helped except the Communist Party. They went in and raised money; for floods, for disasters of all kinds; and they seemed like a great humanitarian to be noticed group. I think most of the young people were pleased by them.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever hold any office in the Communist Party?
Mrs. VERTL. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Neither on the county level nor on a club level?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to a club by the Communist Party? 
Mr. VIERTEL. Yes; I guess so. I must have been assigned, but I think I either-I must have started just with Budd, and then just continued with the writers' group.
Mr. WHEELER. You are referring to Budd Schulberg? Airs. VIERTEL. Yes. I am sorry.
Mr. WHEELER. Why did you leave the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERTEL. For many years, after 1940, really, there was no reason for me to be in it. I had sort of completed my study course, and that was the main reason I was in there, and that is why I returned a few times after 1940, just because they were discussing something I wanted to hear; and they were friends also. I mean, even though I 5792 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA didn't agree with-and I began to realize, you know, we voted on things and that sort, it was nonsense because the things would come down from the top and we would vote either in agreement or disagreement, but that was-had very little bearing on anything. That was quite clear. At times irritating.
Mr. WHEELER. In what specifically did you disagree with the Communist Party doctrine?
Mrs. VMRTEL. All kinds of things.
Mr. WHEELER. Mention them.
Mrs. VIERTEL. Oh, dear. That was a long time ago. Mostly it was on minor levels. The major issues until they switched and that sort of thing; I do believe we either agreed or disagreed, but that was long after the fact. That is an incredible thing for that kind of an organization. I think generally to straighten it up on anything, I had been reading, and reading anti-Communist books for the first time, which was rather odd, and it became rather open.
Mr. WHEELER. You state one reason you became interested in the Communist Party was its stand on the rise of nazism and fascism in Europe. What was your reaction to the Stalin-Hitler pact?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Frankly, I thought it was a good maneuver to gain time.
Mr. WHEELER. How was that explained to you? 
Mrs. VIfRTEL. We were away. It wasn't explained. As you know, we were living in the East then and out of contact with all party members; and the Daily Worker just didn't mention it, as you know, for several days. They didn't know what to say. Budd Schulberg got terribly upset and that was really the end for him, I think. It didn't bother me. I didn't really think it was a pact between these two people-two countries, on any other level except that I think-I thought Russia was pressed for time, and this was kind of a good stalling maneuver. I have been wrong on everything, so I can be wrong on a few more things.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any individuals you met as members of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. VWRTEL. Yes, of course.
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. People in my group? 
Mrs. VMRTEL. Budd Schulberg, Ring Lardner, Jr., Dalton Trumbo, Bob Rossen, Albert Maltz; and ordinarily wives, too; though later not.
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, I think it should be shown that Budd Schulberg has appeared before the committee several years ago and cooperated.
Mr. GANG. I might say that in helping Mrs. Viertel prepare for this thing, I gave her a copy of Mr. Schulberg's testimony so she might read it and refresh her recollection as to what happened those many years ago, and I am sure she did read it.
Mrs. VIERTEL. I did read it, but it didn't refresh too much because he knew people I didn't know, and so on.
Mr. GANG. I see.
Mr. WHEELER. We have the testimony.
Mr. DoYLE. Were these 4 to 6 people you have just named known to you to be members of this Communist group?
Mrs. VmERTEL. I assumed they were, as they undoubtedly assumed I was. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5793 
Mr. DoYLE. Did you attend meetings, closed meetings, of the Communist Party with them?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes, though very often one didn't know whether it was a closed or open meeting, it seems to me. I mean, I have no definite proof that they were, but I assume they were.
Mr. DOYLE. May I make it clear? Do you recall attending any closed meetings of the group at which these 4 or 5 people you named were also present with you?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes, and there must have been others, too.
Mr. DOYLE. I mean meetings at which a non-Communist would not have been admitted.
Mrs. VrEI'rr.L. Probably, yes.
Mr. GANG. Off the record.
Mr. DoYx. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.)
Mr. DOYLE. Back on the record.
Mr. WHEELER. There has been previous testimony before the com- mittee. It, appears in part 4, Communist Infiltration of the Hollywood Motion Picture Industry; the hearings which were held September 17. 18, and 19, 1951, wherein you were identified as a member of the Communist Party and a member of a Communist Parts group. This testimony reflects that the following individuals were member of the group: Gordon Kahn-do you recall Mr. Kahn as a member of the Communist Party? Alirs. VIERTEL. I knew him very well. He may have been in my group and may not. I certainly attended meetings with him.
Mr. WrrrEELER. You have attended meetings with him? Air-. VIERTFL. Yes.
Mr. WnErLrR. Communist Party meetings?
Mrs. ViERTEL. Yes, but I just don't know whether he was in my particular group or not. Air. DoyLE. Were those closed Communist Party meetings?
Mrs. VrauaL No. They would be-I don't believe I ever was in a Jlo ;ed meeting with him. Air. WHEELER. On what would you base your identification that he was a member of the Communist Party? M11. VIEi:L. I assumed he was a Communist from conversations. He was in our group, social group. He spoke Communist the way we all did. I don't know what he would have been doing there if he hadn't been.
Mr. WHEELER. He has been previously identified before the committee, Mr.Doyle.
Mr. DoYLE. Thank you.
Mr. W tEELER. Maurice Rapf.
Mrs. VIEPTEL. Yes; I am sorry. He was-I believe he was in the closed group with us.
Mr. WHEELER. I believe you mentioned Ring Lardner, Jr.?
Mr. GANG. She did.
Mr. WHEELER. Budd Schulberg, Sam Ornitz.
Mrs. VI1RTEL. I don't think he was in our little group. It was rather small.
Mr. VHEELER. Did you know him? 5794 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. VIERTEL. I knew him, and I knew him to be a Communist from his own saying so. May I smoke?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes, indeed.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Well, I am sure I would. It is awful to be so vague. Like Maurice Rapf. I knew him very well, but I hadn't thought of him until you mentioned his name.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Jerome Chodorov?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes; I knew him very well, but not politically. I just knew him as a friend.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Frank Davis?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes; I knew him.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No.
Mr. DoYL. Off the record. (Discussion off the record.)
Mr. DoYLE. Back on the record.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know John Howard Lawson?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes, John Howard Lawson.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Young Communist League prior to your membership in the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. I don't know whether I was really a member, but I went to YCL meetings; but I don't think I wasMr. WHEELER. Did you know Elizabeth Wilson?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. She appeared before the committee as a cooperative witness, and in the course of her testimony identified you as being in attendance at meetings of the Young Communist group.
Mrs. VIERTEL. Well, we went together to a YCL convention in San Francisco, and I drove her, but I think that was the only time I was ever in an actual meeting.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you selected as a delegate by the YCL?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No. I just wanted to go. I had never been.
Mr. DOYLE. What year would that have been ?
Mr. GANG. 1937 or 1938.
Mrs. VIERTEL. It must have been. It was very early.
Mr. Do-LE. Would it have been 1937 or 1938?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I would think 1937.
Mr. DoYLs. In other words, you drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes.
Mr. DoYns. You must have been interested.
Mrs. VMRTEL. I never had been to San Francisco, either; and a group of us went up. I can't remember anybody else. I know Betty Anderson was with us, but I don't know what other characters I took up there.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you use another name when you joined the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5795 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have a Communist Party name?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No. The American consul in Zurich told me I had and told me the name, and he asked me if I knew this woman, and I said, "No," absolutely confident; and lie said it was 1. So apparently I had another name and just didn't know it.
Mr. WIHEELER. When were you interviewed by the American consulate in Zurich?
MrS. VIERTEL. Two years ago.
Mr. WHEELEE. Was it in regard to Communist Party membership?
Mr-. VIETEL. It was in regard to my passport. If I intended living inEurope
Mr. WHEELER. Our records show that you used the name Joan Benton.
Mrs. VIERTEL. That is what he said, but I had no way of knowing that. M11',WHEELER. Do you recall if you were ever a member of the Sam Adams Club of the Communist Party, Hollywood section?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I never heard of that.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend any closed meetings of the Communist Party after the year 1945 ?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No; nor open ones, either.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Leon Becker as a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIERaEL. No. I knew Leon very well. I knew he went to a study group, and I don't knowMr. WHEELEE. Did Leon Becker reside in your and your former husband's home for a while?
Mrs. VIERTL. Yes.
Mr. WsEELR. And Lester Koenig?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. They both resided with you? As s. VIERTEL. Yes. We shared a house.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Lester Koenig was a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. VIEnTmL. There again I assumed he was, but he was not in my group.
Mr. WHEELER. What year did they reside at your home? 
Mrs. VmuEm . I suppose it was 1938 and possibly the begiming of 1939. I am not sure. I am sorry. I know the house and all that, but I am not sure when. 1938 or 1939, as I recollect.
Mr. WHEELEE. Did you go to Mexico City in 1939?
Mrs. VIrTan. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Who accompanied you on the trip?
Mrs. VIERTEL. 1939, my former sister-in-law, Sonia Schulberg, and John Spivak.
Mr. WHEELER. John Spivak? Party
Mrs. VIaTUL. John L. Spivak. Now, he had Communist contacts, but I didn't know that he was a party member.
Mr. WHEELER. For what reason did you travel to Mexico?
Mrs. ViaamET. He didn't know how to drive, and I told him I would me to take drive him, because he wanted to go down-he wanted 5796 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA photographs, which I did, of what he thought were Japanese fortifications in Mexico-not fortifications, but spies, apparently, who were working at odd jobs, and ships that came into the harbor with all kinds of-I don't know-terrible things on them; and I did take pictures and they were published in Ken magazine, which became defunct. That was the purpose of the trip, but mostly it was just a wonderful time. Sonia and I had a great time. MJr. WHEELER. Where did you stay in Mexico?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Well, all kinds of little-it wasn't Mexico City. We went down as far as Guaymas.
Mr. WHEELER. I mean, what coastal towns did you visit?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Guaymas. 3 Jr. WHi:LEE. Was that the only place?
Mrs. ViERTEL. The only coastal.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have a contact with any other person while in Mexico City or in Mexico? We didn't know anybody.
Mrs. VIERTEL. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Just the three of you went Mirs. VIaTEL. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. That would be your formerMrs. VIERTEL. Sister-in-law.
Mr. WHEELER. Sonia Schulberg.
Mrs. VIERTEL. We were left to our own devices, except the time where I took pictures of the Japanese barber who was supposed to be a spy, and the fishing boat that had some sort of equipment.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Communist Party in Los Angeles County or the State of California know you were making this trip?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you gone?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I don't remember. I suppose 10 days. Something like that.
Mr. WHEELER. How far is Guaymas?
Mrs. VIERTEL. It is really the Gulf of California. It is that-you get there much faster by boat from Ensenada down to Guaymas, wlich is an ordinary fishing run when you charter fishing boats. They often go down as far as Guaymas. We went down through Hermosillo. I guess the border was Nogales. We never met anyone that he was seeing because he would disappear on these mysterious missions in the evening and so on. We didn't know where he went and he didn't tell us about it, either.
Mr. WHEELER. In other words, you were not in constant contact with him?
Mr. VRTEL. No, indeed. Mir. WHEELER. You were gone 10 days. It would take what-2 days to get down there?
Mrs. VIERTEL. No. We staved some time in Hermosillo, and then we took a little longer than we thought because the road ended and we had to drive over desert and we didn't know where we were going. We stayed in Guaymas some time. A few days, anyway.
Mr. WHEELER. You say he would leave every night?
Mrs. VIERTEL. And during the day, too.
Mr. WHEELER. During the day, too? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5797 
Mrs. VWRTEL. He was making phone calls, busy seeing people. He didn't tell and we didn't care. We weren't interested in what he was doing.
Mr. WHEER. How did you first meet this John Spivak?
Mrs. VIERTEL. At our house, I guess; through Budd, I imagine.
Mr. DOYLE. We will take a short recess. (Short recess taken.)
Mr. DoYLE. You may proceed, Mr. Wheeler.
Mr. WHEELEE. How long after you met Mr. Spivak did you make the trip to Mexico?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I have no idea when I met him. It seems to me Budd must have known him from college, I should ,ay.
Mr. WHEELER. WIa lie the same age?
Mrs. VIEREEL. No. No. He was older, but he must have known him because that was Budd's most active political tie in all sorts of fields. Not as a Communist, I don't mean, but as editor of the paper and so on he met other editors, writers, and there were lecturers; and Spivak was one of the well-known fellows in young intellectual circle,, We did read his books and so on. I can't remember the names of them any more. He spoke at all kinds of meetings, different kinds of meetiu11> you know.
Mr ,VIEELER. You married Budd Schulberg on December 31, 1936?
Mrc. VIERTEL. 1936.
Mr. WHEELaR. This trip to Mexico was in the year 1939, and that would date your meeting with Mr. Spivak between 1936 and 1939?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Not necescisrily.
Mr. WHEELER. You said Budd Schulberg introduced you two at the house. I assume that you were married?
Mrs. ViERTEL. Oh, we lived with his father after we were married, and I was there considerably before we were married-I mean, there quite a lot. I knew all his friends.
Mr. WH ELER. Did you meet Mr. Spivak before or after your marriage?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I wouldn't know, because we were married in the house that we finally lived in, but that was his father's house.
Mr. WHEELER. How many times did you see Mr. Spivak, before the trip to Mexico?
Mrs. VIEnRTL. Oh, I have no idea. I am sorry.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you consider yourself a good friend of his at that time?
Mrs. VIERL. No.
Mr. WHEELER. What I am trying to get at, is it unusual for two women to drive a man to Mexico?
Mrs. VIERTH. Not really.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the reasons behind it? I mean, how well did you know him, as a good friend ? Did he frequent your home?
Mrs. VIERTEL. He made long-distance phone calls.
Mr. WHEELER. You are being very vague about it.
Mrs. VIERTEL. I don't mean to be vague.
Mr. WHEELER. Here is a man you and your sister-in-law went to Mexico with for 10 days, and it seems to me
Mrs. VIERTEL. We had known him around. He had come to the beach house. We had known him a long time, but we weren't intimate friends. 5798 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA Mir.

Mr. WHaML R. Did they discuss these trips to Mexico with you?
Mrs. VIETEL. Yes, and I told them the same thing, that I didn't understand it.
Mr. WrELERa. Did the American consul ask you? Airs. VIERT]L. No. 
Mr. AVHELER. You were interviewed twice, weren't you, while in Europe
Mrs. VIERTEL. More than twice I went to see him. He was very sympathetic, very nice. We tried to work out-I told him just about eavervthiug I hav e said now, really.
Mr. I EIHrER.In 1943 did you reside at 1439 Stone Canyon Road? M . I'V-ERTEL. What year? 31' WHEELER. 1943.
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes, I did.
Mr. WHEELER. They have a reference here that on August 21 of that year a benefit for the People's World was held at that address.
Mrs. XIRTEL. Yes. I gave my house for this occasion. I didn't have anything else to do with it except giving the house for the party. Air WHEELER. Did you offer your house for other occasions?
Mrs. IERTEL. I may hav e. I don't remember, but that was-I remember it was a very large group, and I had to clean up afterward for days.
Mr. DOYLE. How would you describe the large group? How many people'
Mrs. VIERTEL. There were hundreds there. Air DYLE. 200,500,700?
Mrs VIRTEL. I don't know, but just hundreds. I never saw so many people in one house and the garden; but hundred., certainly. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 5801 
Mr. A\VHEELER. I have a reference that your former husband, Budd Schulberg, made a trip to the Soviet Union. Did you accompany him on that trip li2SVii RUEL. No. I didn't know him then. Ar. WHEELER. Was that prior to your marriage?
Mrs. A'JERTEL. Yes. SDiscision off the record.)
Mr VHEELER. Back on the record. Can you identify anyone else you knew to be a member of the Coanmunist Party?
Mrs;. A-IERTEL. I don't think so. I am sure I could have knownMr. G xc. In other words, if the names were put to you they might refresh your recollection?
Mrs. VIERTEL. That is the only way.
Mr. GANa. If you want to do that, Bill, go ahead. Air. WHLELER. I don't think so, because most of the names that I would mention have already been publicly identified.
Mrs. ViERTEL. Yes. I was surprised when I read Budd's statement of people that I didn't know in the paper. I have been surprised steadily'.
Mr. WHEELER. What led to your complete break with the Communist Party in 1945?
Mrs. VIIrL. Well, I really hadn't attended meetings regularly at all, as you know, since 1940, but every now and then and so on; but it was impossible with my new marriage. Air GANG. Fix that. Whom did you marry? Air . N IERTEL. To Peter Vertel.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you marry him?
Mr.-. VIERTEL. In 1944. Air. G-AinG. Then tell what happened. Ar. VIERTELL. Then he was overseas, and I had a baby, and during the time I was pregnant I lived at Malibu. I was very far away and I simply dropped those contacts. It wasn't possible for me to even see my friends any more unless they came to see me, which they did occasionally, but I didn't go to meetings and I kind of officially dropped out-not officially, but more or less dropped out. I do beheve I ent back to 1 or 2 meetings during the time I was pregnant. Then after I had the baby I never returned to any meeting. A,- husband returned in 1945, and it was impossible for me to see any of my old friends, even, after his return, because he was so violentls anti-Communist; not only in the large sense, but even against the individuals who were that far left; and consequently I made new friends, didn't even see the old friends again, and never-not socially or in the party did I have the same contacts.
Mr. WHEELER. I have no further questions.
Mr. GA G. Any questions, Congressman Doyle?
Mr. DoYa. As I recall it, you had some kind of a break in 1940, but in 1943 you evidently were gracious enough to the old group to have hundreds of people use your garden? Ir-. VIERTEL. Yes, that is all.
Mr. DOYLE. The Communist group.
Mrs. VIsRTL. Certainly. That seems strange, but it isn't becauseit was for the newspaper, after all, and it was always folding. It 5802 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA never had enough money to go on, and so on; so we would give a party and make some money for it. In 1943 I believe it was-I did go to groups from time to time, but not-it wasn't regular. I was working and it wasn't the way it was.
Mr. Do)- . Was there ever a time when you felt that the teachings of the Communist Party, as contrasted to the principles of our own Nation, were inconsistent?
Mrs. VIrS 'i . The teaclinus, the things we learned were excellent; but we didn't learn Communist Party methods nor did we know what the ( iomiuuist Part) was out to get.
Mr. DOYLE. When did you leari that? Mis. VmEumrL. ()h, slow iv, irrevocably it came over us, most of u,, I think. There wasn't one definite time I can say I realized at that moment that it was an organization which we had no business belonging to, because we didn't really understand its anus or its methods.
Mr. Do-.L,. How would you state what you ultimately learned that the Communist Party was out to get, as you say? What major things would you refer to?
Mrs VIERTEL. I suppose what we said of the capital press was partlx responsible. You can't help reading it in Time and every magazine, every newspaper. When they said that the funds that we raised for Spain were mishandled, well, this was a great blow, and I didn't believe it at the time. Slowly I realized we had no way of knowing what happened to the money that we raised; there was no real accountmna; and I think you begin to suspect,. or I began to suspect, first of all, Russia. The people who were running Russia were not, to my mind, splendid citizens, clearly. I hated the hero worship of Stalin, and the reverse now is equally unattractive. There were many things we didn't pay any attention to because I-aiid I imagine many people felt the same way-Russia could make all the mistakes they wanted, it didn't matter. That was not our country. We were trying to improve our own country. If it was a failure there, we hoped it wouldn't be. The whole Socialist experiment was not our country. During the trials I didn't even read about them. I said, "Suppose it is ghastly. That has no bearing on America."
Mr. DoYt. But were you not tr) ing to apply the Socialist doctrine of the Soviet Tmnimto our country I M1s V1ERTEL. We were learning about it. There was certainly no opportumitv for application.
Mr. DOYLE. But in theory you were trying to apply it as a Comnurist? Mll VIERTEL. Yes. MAlr. DoYLL. The Soviet Socialist state in theory, at least lii V'inTwins No. Itxwa- just a Socialist state. We hoped Amnerica would finally 'oet-would finall) become Socialist.
Mr. C \N, Who't about the' democrac)v in the Communist 1'srfy? Itow did it el)e at, Was there ally?
Mrs. VIERTrL. It Was pretty ghastly. That also was another dise,chianti, thing Vs I maid,when we were to have a little election or voice "Yes" or "No" on something that had come down-and I can't remember the things any more-it was clear that we had n!o x oice.
Mr. inYLiE. Aus a matter of practice within the Communist Part during the val- you were in it, was there applied? democracy or applied democratic processes? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF. AREA 5803 VIERTEL. Oh, es; theoretically. . But actmnlly? You are making it very difficult for us
Mr. GA here. Don't be so finicky. Tell the facts.
Mri. 'IERTEL. No; it certainly wasn't in our little group. It wasn't. Someone would take charge, and that would be it.
Mr. DOYLE. I am dehberatelv asking you a few questions to get the benefit of your conclusions. \ ou have had an unusual experience and can be helpful to us in Congress in understanding it.
Mrs. VIERTEL. I was such an unimportant member. This is another problem: that I wasn't in on the higher level.
Mr. DOYLE. iBut you were an intellectual in the Communist Party.
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes; that is the only reason I got in, and for intellectual reasons I think most of us got out, for the same accumulation of them, not just one thing. Mi'. DOYLE. As you know, the committee exists by authority of Congress to learn in what way wvecan conclude means to recommend to Congress different or additional legislation. Should we modify. change, amend, or add to the present laws? Have you any thought in that field? In other words, is Congress meeting the problem so far as legislation is concerned? If not, wherein are we failing?
Mr. Gavo.. May I ask, what you mentioned to me off the record in that line, do you mean what laws could be passed to help prevent such a vacuum for the youngas existed in the 1930's when young people were sucked into it?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I don't think they need to be, frankly. I don't think conditions are the same now. The young people I know now are not interested remotely, and I think the times have changed, especially in our country. There is no reason for it. There is no need to findMr. DOYLE. Why did you come forward and volunteer to come before the committee?
Mrs. VIErurra. There are an awful lot of circumstances altogether. I think probably I would just have let it go, because my life is pretty busy just being a mother, you know; but they know about Peter, certainlyMr. G-kx. But the point Mr. Doyle made is do you feel that you want to tell the committee of Congress everything you know to help them in legislating or not legislating on the problem
Mrs. VIERYLL. Yes, certainly; but whatever I know, I didn't believe before anything I could say would be of any help, because I didn't know enough. I knew nothing new. I didn't know as much as most people, so I didn't think it was urgent or interesting before.
Mr. DOYLE. Let me ask one concluding question. Off the record please, Mr. Reporter. (Discussion off the record.) menMr. DoYLE. Now, is the identification that we have previously tioned true?
Mrs. VEWRrEL. Yes. as
Mr. DOYLE. You heard Mr. Wheeler refer to your identification by certain a member of the Communist Party as having been made Ars. persons? 5804 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIF., AREA 
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. 
Mr. DOYLE. Was that identification correct?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes; it was.
Mr. DOYLE. And true?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. 
Mr. DoYLE. I want to ask this: If in the future you learn of other former Communists who come to the point where they wonder whether or not they are welcome to come before the committee, will you make it clear that they are welcome?
Mrs. VIERTEL. I do believe everybody knows that they can.
Mr. DoYE. You think that is generally known now?
Mrs. VIERTEL. Yes. 
Mr. DoYLE. Because we have that standing rule and invitation to appear before the committee.
Mrs. VIERTEL. I think they often don't know where you are, possibly.
Mr. DOYLE. That is true. They can always get in touch with Mr. Wheeler.
Mrs. VIERTEL. I also want to state I am grateful indeed to Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Doyle for letting me come and clear up whatever I could.
Mr. DOYLE. We want to thank you very much.
Mrs. ViERTEL. Thank you. I am sorry I was vague and not helpful.
