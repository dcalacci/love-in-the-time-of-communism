Miss KINNEY. Anne Kinney. 1Mr. WHEELER. Where were you born ?
Miss KINNEY. Chicago. 
Mr. WHEELER. What has been your educational background?
Miss KINNEY. Well, I am a graduate of Chicago Normal College; now Chicago Teachers' College.
Mr. WHEELER. What has been your employment background?
Miss KINNEY. I taught for a year after I graduated from college. Later most of my employment was in clerical capacities. I worked as an inspector during the war.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you employed during the war ? 
Miss KINNEY. From 1942 to 1944 I worked for Studebaker Corp. in Chicago.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been employed since that time ?
Miss KINNEY. From the fall of 1944 until December of 1946, I worked for the United Office and Professional Workers. Since then I have had temporary jobs of maybe 2 to 4 weeks' duration, 3 or 4 of those.
Mr. WHEELER. Where do you presently reside?
Miss KINNEY. Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; I was.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you join the Communist Party ?
Mr. KINNEY. August 1933.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been known by any other name ?
Miss KINNEY. I was Jane Howe. 2SReleased by the committee Anne Kinney was sworn in as a witness by the court reporter. 868 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Was this a Commulnist Party name?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr WHEELER. For what purpose did you use the name Jane Howe?
Miss KINNEY. Principally as a means of protecting the person with whom I was living at the time I joined. It was common practice for people to use a different name in the party.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the reasons for your becoming a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Like many people, I was appalled by what happened during the depression, by the conditions under which people were forced to live. Being both idealistic and without any knowledge of political science or economics, I was easily convinced that Marxism was the answer. When the Socialist Party seemed to be doing nothing that was effective, I began to wonder if perhaps the Communist Party was where I would find more immediate activity. I did some reading in the public library which led me to believe that they and not the Socialists were following Marxist principles. Therefore, in August 1933, I applied for membership by going to the county office and asking to join.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you recruited by any specific person ?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. After becoming a member of the Communist Party, to what branches were you assigned?
Miss KINNEY. First to a neighborhood branch.
Mr. WHEELER. You correct me if I am wrong about this. I understand that from October 1933 to February 1934 there was a special group within the Socialist Party.
Miss KINNEY. I had forgotten about that.
Mr. WHEELER. February 1934 to May 1934, Hollywood street group. May 1934 to September 1934, a Burbank street group. From September 1934 to the fall of 1935, a member at large.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. The fall of 1935 to December 1938, a teachers' unit. December 1938 to August 1939, 56th assembly district, which is in the 13th Congressional District.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. From August 1939 to the fall of 1940, section organizer, 15th Congressional District. The fall of 1940 to May 1942, working on the county membership commission, organizer of the 65th assembly district, and for a short period of time county membership director.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. From May 1942 to the summer or fall of 1944, a Studebaker plant unit in Chicago.
Miss KINNEY. Just a minute. There is actually a gap of a few months there, while I was in transit, so to speak.
Mr. WHEELER. We will explain that when we cover each group.
Miss KINNEY. I was going from here to there.
Mr. WHEELER. Transferred. That can be clarified.
Miss KINNEY. That covers almost 6 months.
Mr. WHEELER. From the fall of 1944 to the fall of 1945, the Hyde Park branch in Chicago, a street unit. Is that correct?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 869 
Mr. WHEELER. Have you reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation what knowledge you have of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; I have.
Mr. WHEELER. When and to what office did you give your infor- mation ?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was March 1951, in Phoenix.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the members of the Communist Party assigned to the Socialist branch?
Miss KINNEY. I remember Harold and Mildred Ashe, John Spears, Marjorie Hay.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you describe a little more fully each individual?
Miss KINNEY. Harold Ashe was at that time State secretary of the Socialist Party. John Spears was unemployed. Marjorie Hay was teaching in the Los Angeles city schools. All were members of the Socialist Party at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you given any instructions by any member of the Communist Party as to your activity within the Socialist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you explain your answer more fully?
Miss KINnEY. Well, I don't remember now too well, except we were supposed to build up this rank and file group, which was sort of an opposition group to the State leadership.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the members of this Communist Party unit within the Socialist Party have anything to do to disrupt the normal proceedings of the Socialist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Well, I think the group tried.
Mr. WHEELER. Did they have any success? 
Miss KINNEY. To a certain extent, yes. There were perhaps 3 locals of the Socialist Party that withdrew. Two of them, I think, turned into unemployed organizations, and I think the third one may have become a branch of the American League Against War and Fascism.
Mr. WHEELER. How was this accomplished? 
Miss KINNEY. At this point I really couldn't tell you.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you identify the members of the Hollywood street branch to which you were assigned ?
Miss KINNEY. I think the only one I remember is Dr. Tashjian.1
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals comprised the Hollywood branch?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were about 10.
Mr. WHEELER. Then you recall no additional individuals at this time ?
Miss KIN-EY. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. You testified that you were a member of a street branch in Burbank from approximately September 1934 to the fall of 1943. Can you identify the members of the Burbank group?
Miss KINNEY. Bill and Nina Ingham, Albert Lockett. That is all I can remember now.
Mr. WIEELER. How many individuals comprised this group?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were just about 7 or 8. 
Mr. WHEELER. From September 1934 to the fall of 1935, you stated you were a member at large. What is meant by the term "member at large?" SDr Vaughan A K Tashjian 870 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. You are not attached to any branch of any sort.
Mr. WHEELER. For what reason ?
Miss KINNEY. Because I was given a special assignment.
Mr. WHEELER. In your opinion, would you say that you were a member at large and not assigned to any group because of security reasons of the party ?
Miss KINNEY. I presume so.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to any particular person?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, to Harrison George.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you further identify Mr. Harrison George?
Miss KINNEY. Harrison George was apparently carrying out some special assignment which had to do with publishing what I think ,-as a trade-union paper that was sent to Japan. I knew very little about it, because all I was supposed to do was pick up mail for him that was sent to various addresses and take it to him.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall from whom you picked up the mail?
Miss KINNEY. NO, I don't. I never made the arrangements for the use of the addresses. I simply went and got the envelopes and took them to George.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the addresses where you picked up the envelopes?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at any time acquire any knowledge as to what the envelopes contained'
Miss KINNEY. No, I didn't, nor did I ever know where they came from. 
Mr. WHEELER. When assigned to Harrison George, did you at any time have any knowledge of a branch of the party known as the Philippine committee?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. IWIIEELER. According to your testimony, you were assigned to a teachers' unit from the fall of 1935 to December 1938. Who were the members of this group ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember when they came in, with rare exceptions. 
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the members of this group during the time you were a member?
Miss KINNEY. Marjorie Hay, who was teaching in the Los Angeles schools. Harry Shepro. I think you should assume that, unless I mention anything to the contrary, all of them were in the city schools.
Mr. WHEELER. All right. Mis KIN-NEY. Sam Wixman. I think his wife was a member. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her first name?
Miss KINNEY. No. Norman Byrne.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall a member of this unit by the name of Honor Moxley Carey ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall whether or not you recruited this individual?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I did. She subsequently dropped out, I think, probably about 1937, but I am not sure exactly when. I do know she did drop out. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 871 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how long she was a member of this group?
Miss KINNEYI. No, I am not sure. There was Beulah Wales, who was a member only for the first few months.
Mr. WIHEELER. Was Rose Posell a member of this unit?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr WHEELER. WaS she still a member when you left the teachers' group?
Miss KINNEY. So far as I can recall. There were two teachers from Glendale, Dick Lewis and LeRoy Herndon.
Mr. WHEELER. Dick Lewis, would that be Richard B. Lewis.
Miss KINNEY. It is Richard; I don't know his middle initial.
Mr. WHEELER. How long was Mr. Lewis in this group, do you recall
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember exactly when he joined. He still was a member at the time I left.
Mr. TWHEELER. Was Mr. Herndon also a member at the time you left the teachers' unit?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WIHEELER. Do you recall Abe Minkus? 
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he a member of this group ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; he was.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Zara Becker?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Ruth Stoddard Ryan?
Miss KINNEY. Ruth Ryan was a member. She was not in the city schools. I am not sure whether she was teaching in the nursery school at that time or whether she had in the past. Becky Goodman was also a member. She was a nursery school teacher. I am not sure she was teaching then.
Mr. WHIEELER. Was Angelina Riskin a member of the Communist Party'
Miss KINNEY. Yes. /
Mr. WTHEELER. Was Brodia Most a member of this teachers' unit
Miss KINNEY. I think so.
Mr. W HEELER. Were you acquainted with Davida Franchia?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; but she wasn't a member of the teachers' unit.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what group she was a member of?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. However, you did meet her as a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER. member ?
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER. you were in ? Yes. WaS Al Lewis a member of the teachers' unit? Yes. Do you recall if his wife, Matilda Lewis, was a Yes; she was. Are you acquainted with Frank Oppenheimer? Yes. Was he a member of the Communist Party ? Yes; in Pasadena.
Mr. Oppenheimer was not a member of the group 872 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the occasion you met him as a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. It was at some meeting in connection with the professional section.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that meeting be termed as a fraction meeting ? Mis KINNEY. No; it was not a section meeting. It may have been a meeting of branch organizers in that section, something of that sort.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever have the occasion to meet any other teachers who were members of the Communist Party from the Pasadena section
Miss KINNEY., I don't think there were any teachers. Oppenheimer, as I recall, was a research assistant, or something like that, at Caltech.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals were members of this group, the total amount of people going in and being transferred and quitting ? What would your estimate be? Niss KIXXNEY I would imagine there would have been maybe 25. That is allowing for a few I undoubtedly have forgotten about.
Mr. WHEELER. When I interviewed you the first time, you mentioned a teacher whose first name was Claire. Do you recall the last name?
Miss KINsEY. No.
Mr. WTHEELEE. Were you a nember of local 430, American Federation of Teachers?
Miss KIN-NE . Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When was local 430 organized?
Miss KINNEY. Fall of 1935.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at any time hold an office in local 430?
Miss KIxNEY. Yes; I was recording secretary for a year, almost a year.
Mr. WEELER. Do you recall what year?
Miss KI-NET. I think the fall of 1938.
Mr WHEELER. Did any of the individuals you mentioned, members of the Communist Party, hold any office in local 430 ?
Miss KINNETY. At one time or another Harry Shepro and Marjorie Hay, and I think Sam Wixman, held office. I am not sure whether any of the others did or not.
Mr. WHEELER. In your opinion, did the Communist Party control local 430?
Miss KIXNEX-. I would say it exerted considerable influence. Mi. WHEELER. What was the party's main objective in bringing teachers to the Communist Party?
Miss KIXNEr. It may have been the intention of higher party authorities to exert influence on the teachers and thereby on the material they taught, and the way in which they repeated it to the children. In practice. I don't think it worked out to any great extent. At least, during the time I was in the teachers' branch, there never was any discussion of what doctrines we taught and what we did with it.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you employed as a teacher ?
Miss KINNEY. No; I wasn't.
Mr. WIEELER. Did member teachers have meetings prior to regular meetings in local,430 to discuss what course of action was to be taken by the Communist fraction in real meetings ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 873 
Miss KINNEY. Subjects of that nature were discussed in them.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any specific problems that were discussed prior to union meetings?
Miss KINNEY. Largely the question of building up the union membership. The teachers would hold meetings prior to regular meetings and at times-one problem was to keep some of the non-Communist teachers, union members, from being busier "saving the world" than they were on the problems facing the teachers in Los Angeles. The Communists were anxious to build up the union as a stronger force among the teachers in Los Angeles.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the approximate membership of local 430 ?
Miss KINNEY. I have forgotten.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you say 100
Miss KIxNEY. No: it was over that. I don't remember whether it was close to 200 or just what it was.
Mr. WHEELER. Were all the teachers you mentioned as members of the Communist Party also members of local 430?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. On what percentage of votes could the Communist Party depend on, on any given subject, which reflected the Communist Party line?
Miss KINNEY. There were, as I recall, no issues on which there was any sharp fight. The situation in the thirties was different than it is now, and as a rule there was no particular opposition to any proposals which Communists in the hearings might have made.
Mr. WHEELER. Was a Communist teacher given any particular instructions regarding indoctrination of students?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Would a Communist teacher in class discussion ever take an anti-Soviet attitude ?
Miss KINNEY. I doubt that they would.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you believe a Communist teacher is a suitable person to educate the students of this country?
Miss KINNEY. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. Why?
Miss KINNEY. Because I don't think their first loyalty is to the welfare of this country.
Mr. WHEELER. To what country would you say they owe their allegiance?
Miss KINNEY. To Russia.
Mr. WHEELER. On what do you base this answer?
Miss KINNEY. The fact that all during the time I was in the party it was considered the Soviet Union could do no wrong.
Mr. WHEELER. During the time you were a member of the Communist Party, did you place your allegiance to the Soviet Union above that of the United States?
Miss KINNEY. I wouldn't say that I did, because I felt that there wasn't a contradiction. I, of course, no longer feel that way.
Mr. WHEELER. How many branches of the American Federation of Teachers were there in California ?
Miss KINNEY. I think six.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were these locals located? 31747-53-pt. 5-3 874 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY1.I can remember there were locals in Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, and Los Angeles. I am not sure about Sacramento.
Mr. WHEELER. Were there any members of the Communist Party in the locals which you have mentioned?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were in San Diego, in Oakland.
Mr. W-HEELER. Did you ever attend a Communist fraction meeting comprised of representatives of the various locals? Nlis. KINNEY. Yes. It didn't include people from all the locals. 1 left one out, incidentally. There was one in Palo Alto.
Mr. Win l.LER. Where was this fraction meeting held? 
Miss Kixx.. Somewhere in Palo Alto, previous to a State convention of the American Federation of Teachers.
Mr. WVHEELER. Do you remember how many individuals attended this meeting?
Miss KINNEY. NO. I got very ill in the middle of that convention and I spent a lot of the time in bed, in the hotel, and I don't remember.
Mr. VWHIEELER. Well, do you recall any of the teachers who attended this Communist fraction meeting
Miss KINNEY. There were two teachers from Oakland whose names I don't remember. Dr. Holland Robert, in Palo Alto. I think Harry Steinmetz, from San Diego. 
Mr. WIIEELER. Did you ever meet Harry Steinmetz on any other occasion? 
Miss KINNEY. I think he came to our house one time. I know he calme to our house at one time. 
Mr. WhIEELER. You are certain lie was a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, he was; he was at that fraction meeting. Pre- sumably he was or lie wouldn't have been at the meeting.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who attended the meeting ?
Miss KINNEY. No; I don't even remember who else from Los Angeles was there.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what was discussed?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. You have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any other teachers than the ones previously identified ?
Miss KINNEY. I was told there was a teacher in San Francisco, but I don't remember the name, if I ever knew it.
Mr. WHEELER. You don't recall anyone else at this time?
Miss KINNEY No. 
Mr. WIIEELER. Do you have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any present or former member of the Los Angeles City Board of Education?
Miss KINNEY. The board of education?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes.
Miss KINNEY Oh, no. iMr. 7TIIEELER. What is your answer regarding the Los Angeles county y Board of Education?
Miss KINXNY. I don't think I have ever even known who was on the county board of education.
Mr. WIEELER. Do you have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any present or former member of the State board of education ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 875 
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Were any members or employees of the city, county, or State boards of education considered to be friends or individuals who would be trusted by the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Not so far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have knowledge of Communist Party membership of any present or former employee of the city, county, or State boards of education? I don't mean the teachers. I mean the actual people employed by the city and county and State boards to actually help the board members
Miss KINNEY. I don't know that I remember anything about it.
Mr. WHEELER. Were yol ever a member of the disciplinary colmmittee of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I have been a member of a committee that acted as a disciplinary committee. It was a committee appointed by the 13th congressional section. As for the county disciplinary committee, I never was a member of it.
Mr. ~VIIEELER. For what purpose was this committee set up?
Miss KINNEY. You mean the one in the 13th congressional district?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. Well, there were two members of a branch, whose names I don't recall, who had done something, I don't recall what, and it was felt they should be called in and questioned. Who they were, I don't know, or about what. Nor do I remember what final action the committee took.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you recall the members of this committee?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at any time prefer charges against any member of the Communist Party which resulted in a hearing before a disciplinary committee ?
Miss KINNEY. Well, the teachers' branch acted, as a whole, as a disciplinary committee, so far as Sam Wixman was concerned.
Mr. WHEILER. Did you prefer the charges against Sam Wlxman?
Miss KINNEY. Well, in the sense the charges were preferred; yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the nature of the charges, do you recall?
Miss KINNEY. In general, disruption, but I don't remember anything specific.
Mr. WHEELER. Where was the meeting held ? 
Miss KINNEY. It was a regular teachers' branch meeting. I mean, we met at various teachers' homes, and I don't remember at what particular homes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was present at this meeting?
Miss KINNEY. Harry Shepro, Marjorle Hay, Honor6 Moxley Carey, Mildred' Wixman.
Mr. WHEELER. Would her name be Myrtle ?
Miss KINNEY. Myrtle, yes.
Mr. WHIEELER. You recall her name as Myrtle? 
Miss KINxlN-. Yes, it is Myrtle. I don't remember who all was there. The whole branch membership was there, whoever the members at that time were. But I don't recall exactly.
Mr. YWHEELER. Do you recall who the witnesses were?
Miss KINNEY. It wasn't conducted in such a formal manner, as to have witnesses. We discussed Wixman's actions at great length.
Mr. WHEELER. tWas WXlxman present to defend himself? SName corrected to be Myrtle 876 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES ARhA 
Miss KINNEY. We had two meetings on this. He was present at the first one. As I recall, he refused to come to the second.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what his position was at the first meeting?
Miss KINNEY. Well, he of course maintained he hadn't been disrupting. He maintained that position at considerable length, but I couldn't give any details.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the approximate date of this disciplinary hearing?
Miss KINNEY. I would guess it was about January 1937.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the result ?
Miss KINNEY. The branch voted that he be expelled.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Wixman so notified?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I think so.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Wixman ever permitted to rejoin the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Not that I know of.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall when Wixman lost his teaching position in June 1940 ?
Miss KINNEY. I heard that he had.
Mr. WHEELER. Did not the Communist Party attempt to assist Wixman in regaining his employment?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the Classroom Teachers' Federation?
Miss KINNEY. I knew there was such an organization, which had been in existence a long time.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know the background of the organization, a little information as to when it was started and what the purpose was?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know when it was started. The people that started the Classroom Teachers' Federation felt the teachers' organizations were not doing enough to look after the interests of the classroom teachers and were to a great extent influenced by the principles.
Mr. WHEELER. Were the teachers you have identified as members of the Communist Party also members of the Classroom Teachers' Federation?
Miss KINNEY. I think some of them were.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Teachers' Federation support Wixman in his difficulty with the board of education?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. From December 1938 to August 1939, you have testified that you were a member of the 56th-assembly-district branch of the 13th Congressional District, is that correct?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any official position ?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember any of the members of this group ? 
Miss KINNEY. The chairman of the branch was called Ann. Lew Scott was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you further identify Lew Scott?
Miss KINNEY. I can't. I don't know what he did.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you transferred to the 56th assembly branch for any specific reason? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 877 
Miss KINNEY. Lew Scott was causing some difficulty in the branch and I was assigned there, shall we say, to keep him from becoming too influential, because it was felt by many people he was perhaps, as we called it an unreliable element.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else who was a member of this unit ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't; no.
Mr. WHEELER. You have testified that from August 1939 to the fall of 1940 you were a section organizer of the 15th Congressional District. What were your duties?
Miss KINNEY. Well, in general, I was held responsible for the proper functioning and activity of the branches making up the 15th Congressional District section.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you estimate the approximate membership of the 15th Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. I think there were about 150 members.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the publication Two Decades of Progress?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. I will ask you if that document was an official publication of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was supposed to be.
Mr. WHEELER. For identification, the cover reads: "Two Decades of Progress, Communist Party, L. A. County, 1919-39." The back cover discloses the document was printed by the Dependable Printers, 2510 Brooklyn Avenue. I will ask you to look at page 30 of the document, or, the book, rather, and state whether or not the photograph appearing on that page is yours.
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Will you read the entire page into the record?
Miss KINNEY (reading) : Fifteenth Congressional District, room 213, 3950 West Sixth Street, FA. 9552. Jane Howe, Organizer. From Hollywood Boulevard to Slauson, from Fairfax to Hoover Street, the 15th Congressional District is typical of Los Angeles. The workers in the closeto-billion-dollar motion-picture industry, fighting for honest, democratic trade unionism; the unemployed, fighting for jobs and adequate relief, the smallbusiness men, struggling to keep from being squeezed out; these are the people who, along with the Negro and Japanese people who live in the district, have begun to come together in a movement for progressive government. The election of four progressive councilmen-Nelson, Benett, Briggs, and Rasmussen-is an indication of the possibility of ousting the present Tory Democrat, Congressman Costello, in 1940. Since 1934, with the first fight for free speech in Hollywood, the Communist Party has been an important factor in every struggle of the people. The studio strikers of 1937, the Hollywood Citizen-News pickets of 1938, the Workers' Alliance, Labor's Nonpartisan League, Ham and Eggers have all seen the party in action, helping in every progressive movement Their appreciation was shown in the large vote given Emil Freed, Communist candidate for Congress in 1938. 57th assembly district: East branch, Emil Freed. president, 1505 North Western Avenue West branch, Jack Ginsberg, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Day branch, J. Caroway, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Hans Eisler branch, M. Morris, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Hollywood Studio, Milton Henry, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Newspaper branch, Peter Steel, president, 3950 West Sixth Street 878 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 58th assembly district Wilshire branch, Libby Jacobson, president, 3084 San Marino Street Japanese branch, John Matsuto, president, 3950 West Sixth Street Lawyers' branch, Lawrence West, president, 3950 West Sixth Street 63d assembly district: 63d assembly-district branch, Sara Kusnitz, president, 2180 West Twentyninth Street Culver City Studio, Frank Oats, president, 3950 West Sixth Street 65th assembly district: Anya Lieberson, president, 1240 West Fortieth Place
Mr. WHEELER. Do yOU recall writing what you have just read? 
Miss KINNEY. I don't know whether I wrote it or Emil Freed wrote it.
Mr. WHEELER. In your position as organizer, would you have approved it?
Miss KIXNEY. I would have approved it.
Mr. WHIEELER. Were any of the councilmen mentioned on this page members of the Communist Party?
Miss KIXNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. What part did you, as organizer of the 15th Congressional District, or the Communist Party have in the "first fight for free speech in Hollywood"?
Miss KI NEY. I don't know what they mean by the "'irstfight for free speech in Hollywood" in 1939. I have no recollection of it.
Mr. WHIEELER. To quote from this page: The studio strikers of 1937, the Hollywood Citizen-News pickets of 1938, the Workers' Alliance, Labor's Nonpartisan League, Ham and Eggers have all seen the party in action. What part did the Communist Party take in the studio strike of 193 ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you take any part in it?
Miss KINNEY. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. What part did the party take in the Workers' Alliance?
Miss KINNEY. I presume that some party members were members of the Workers' Alliance and probably helped to establish branches of the Workers' Alliance. I don't know. At the time that this publication appeared, I had only been section organizer for about 3 weeks in this section.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the Workers' Alliance?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever employed by the Workers' Alliance?
Miss KINNEY. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you consider the Workers' Alliance a front for the Communist Party? 
Miss KINNEY. To a certain extent, I think it was. To a certain extent, I think it was a legitimate organization that probably was able to do something for the unemployed; what they would not have been able to do without an organization.
Mr. WHEELER. You have mentioned in your testimony that the Communist Party may have been insti mental in assisting in setting up branches of the Workers' Alliance, isn't that correct?
Miss KINNET. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 879 
Mr. WHEELER. The Communist Party certainly wouldn't lend their assistance to organizations unless the organizations were in sympathy with the objectives of the party, would they ? The Communist Party wouldn't assist in setting up a branch of the German-American Bund?
Miss KINNE. No. What I mean by my previous answer is this: The party may have had definite ideas about what it hoped to accomplish for the Workers' Alliance, but I think that at the same time some good things were accomplished for the unemployed. Do you understand the distinction I am trying to make?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. I don't feel that you can condemn the Workers' Alliance outright and say everything they did was bad. I think they did a lot of things that were better left undone.
Mr. WHEELER. I don't think you can say that the Communist Party is all bad. I think there is some agreement in some of their objectives that perhaps most American citizens do agree with.
Miss KINNET. The objectives on top, the public objectives are perhaps some things with which yon can agree.
Mr. WIIEEL:R. I think we all agree with slum clearance.
Miss KINNEY. The party, I think, has always followed a practice of trying to pick , public objective that many people are in agreement with.
Mr. WHEELER. Getting back to page 30 again, what part did the party take in the Labor's Non-Partisan League?
Miss KINNEY. I think some party members were members of the Labor's Non-Partisan League.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say that the Labor's Non-Partisan League was in the same category as Workers' Alliance, so far as your description of Workers' Alliance goes?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was probably lessMr. WHELLER. Infiltrated?
Miss KIN-NEY. Influenced by the party. I think that the Labor's Non-Partisan League was less influenced by the party.
Mr. WHELLER. According to page 30 of this document, a number of Communist Party branches were in your district. The first listed is the east branch of the 57th Assembly District. Emil Freed is listed as president. Do you know Emil Freed as a Communist and president of the East Branch?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall any other members in that branch?
Miss KINNEY. His wife was a member.
Mr . WHELLER. Do you recall her given name? 
Miss KINNEY. Tassia.
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall anyone else?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't
Mr. WHELLER. What type of branch was the East Branch? 
Miss KINNEY. A street branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Who maintained the membership records for the 15th 'Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. It would be the section membership director, and I -don't remember who it was.
Mr. WHELLER. Who was section treasurer?
Miss KINNEY. Tassia Freed. 880 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall the approximate amount of moneys collected per month as dues?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall what percentage of the money taken in as dues was retained by the section and what part went to the Los Angeles County organization?
Miss KINNEY. I used to know all those things. I think the section kept 10 percent. How much the branches kept and how much went to the county, I don't remember.
Mr. WHELLER. Who appointed you section organizer?
Miss KINNLI. I was elected by the section committee on the proposal of the-proposed to them, I believe, by the county committee or by the county organizer.
Mr. WHELLER. The county organizer at that time was Max Silver?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember whether it was Max Silver or Paul Cline.
Mr. WHELLER. The second branch listed in the document "2 Decades of Progress" is the West Branch. What can you tell us about this unit?
Miss KINNEY. It was also a street branch. Aside from Jack Ginsberg, who is listed as president, his wife Margaret was a member. I believe Fanya Friedman was a member. I don't remember anybody else.
Mr. WHELLER. The next branch listed is a day branch, 57th Assembly District, with J. Caroway listed as president. What do you remember about this branch?
Miss KINNEY. Not a thing.
Mr. WHELLER. Do you recall J. Caroway ? 
Miss KINNEY. No. I am not sure whether it was supposed to be housewives or whether it was people who worked at night.
Mr. WHEELER. The next branch listed in the document is the Hans Eisler Branch, 75th Assembly District What type of branch was the Eisler Branch?
Miss KINNEY. The branch listed as the Eisler Branch, was a branch of musicians.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the head of this branch was?
Miss KINNEY. Miriam Brooks.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the members?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. How do branches acquire the names?
Miss KINNEY. The branch chooses the name. If it chooses the name of a person dead or alive, it is somebody whom they feel may not necessarily have been or be a Communist, but represents principles which the Communists support. I know of one branch named Thomas Masaryk, who I believe was the first president of Czechoslovakia. What I am trying to say is that because a branch is named for a person doesn't necessarily mean that person is or was a Communist.
Mr. WHEELER. It doesn't mean he is anti-Communist, does it?
Miss KINNEY. Certainly wouldn't be anti-Communist. That is, if it were someone who is alive. Someone dead, you can assume the party may assume he might have been pro-Communist; other people may have had their doubts. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 881 
Mr. WIIEELER. We had testimony in 1945 in regard to this matter we are discussing. The witness said that they would never name a branch of the Communist Party after a live Communist because of the fact that he may be driven out of the party and turn against them. I am somewhat surprised a Hans Eisler branch appears, which is named after a man who is currently alive.
Miss KINNEY. I think there have been instances when branches have been named for live Communists, and I believe there have been embarrassing consequences sometimes, too.
Mr. WHEELER. This procedure probably started after Eisler's branch was set up. The next branch entered in the document "2 Decades of Progress" is a Hollywood branch. What knowledge do you have concerning this branch ?
Miss KINNEY. The members were workers in the studios, in the crafts, that is, carpenters, painters, electricians, and so on.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the head of this branch?
Miss KINNEY. It says here Milton Henry, which doesn't mean a thing. John Bevins Was the head of that branch, so far as I remember.
Mr. WHEELER. How was Mr. Bevins employed?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember what John was doing at that time. I don't know whether lie was working in the studios then or not. I know he had in the past, one time.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall that John Bevins was his true name or a party name?
Miss KINNEY. John Bevins was the name I knew him by. It may have been a party name.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall whether or not he was also known as Jacob Levine ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet a Jacob Levine in the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. No, not that I recall.
Mr. nTTIEELER. The next branch listed is the newspaper branch. It tells who was head of the newspaper branch.
Miss KINNEY. I ani not sure who was head of the newspaper branch. I know that Sid Burke was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Peter Steel is listed in the document as president. Do you recall Peter Steel?
Miss KINNEY. Not by that name.
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, Peter Steel is a party name and is actually Charles Judson, who testified as a cooperative witness in Washington last year. Did you know Charles Judson?
Miss KINNEY. I think so.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else were members?
Miss KINNEY I think Tom Cullen was a member.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else do you remember?
Miss KINNEY. Ed Robbins,'Herb Klein, Brick Garrigues; I don't remember Brick's real first name. I know him as Brick. I know that at one time Jay Moss and Dolph Winebrenner and Urcel Daniel were members, but I don't remember whether it was at this particular time or not. 1 According to information received by the committee, the full name of this individual is Charles H. Garnrgues 882 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Were all these individuals connected with the newspaper business
Miss KINNEY. So far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, Urcel Daniel testified as a cooperative witness in Washington in 1952. Do you recall if George Shaffer was a member of this group?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Minna Klein a member of this group, also? 
Miss KINNEY. I don't know. I know she was a member of the party.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if William E. Oliver was a member of this group ?
Miss KINNEY. I am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Mr. Oliver as a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I think I have heard the name, but I don't recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Lillian Jones?
Miss KINNEY. Lillian Jones
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if Lillian Jones was a member of the newspaper branch?
Miss KINNEY. Not so far as I know. She, I think, was a member of that branch in Hollywood that I was in, in 1934.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know her occupation?
Miss KINNEY. She was secretary of the workers' school at the time I knew her, I believe.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she employed in the film industry ?
Miss KINNEY. Not as far as I know.
Mr. WHEELER. "2 Decades of Progress," page 30, also discloses that the 58th Assembly District was in the 15th Congressional District. According to this document the 58th Assembly District contained three Communist Party branches, the first being the Wilshire branch. What type of branch was the Wilshire branch'
Miss KINNEY. That was a street branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anything about the Wilshire branch?
Miss KINNEY. Libby Jacobson was the chairman of the branch. Emily and Julian Gordon were members of it.
Mr. WHEELER. The second group listed within the 58th Assembly District is a Japanese group. What knowledge do yo have regarding this group?
Miss KINNEY. There was a small group of Japanese and it was my impression they were all Japanese gardeners; none of them spoke English. The president of the branch I knew only as George. I don't know his last name. He spoke very little English.
Mr. WHEELER. The third branch listed within the 58th Assembly District is a lawyers branch. What can you tell us about this branch?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember this Lawrence West, who is listed as president. I believe Jack Franko was a member of that branch. I must have known other members at the time, but I don't remember now.
Mr. WHEELER. I would like to refer to volume III of executive hearings of July 17, 18, 19, 22, 26; August 5, 6, 16, 17, 19 and 20, 1940, of hearings before Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 76th Congress. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 883 On page 1239 of this document, I read the following: Carey McWilliams, state housing commissioner Jane Howe, former professional section membership director, gave me his name as the one to contact to make arrangements for my appearance at the Communist Party's lawyers' unit. The Communist Party unit is synonymous with the lawyers guild faction. This is the testimony of a person, a former member of the Communist Party, who appeared before the committee in 1940, and testified to what I have just read.
Miss KINNEY. That I told them to contact Carey McWilliams?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. I never would have, because to my knowledge Carey McWilliams was never a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Carey McWilhams?
Miss KINNEY I met him once.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the occasion?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. It was at a time when he and a group of others, whom I do not remember, were planning a conference in connection with the foreign born, and I think it was alien registration. I went to his office. I think he was State housing commissioner at that time. I went to his office in my capacity as section organizer for the 15th Congressional District, to offer him the help of our section in organizing this group.
Mr.WIEELER. You identified yourself to him as an organizer of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. What was his reaction ?
Miss KINNEY. He was very polite and noncommittal. He said he would be glad to have help from anybody that was concerned about these things but did not make any specific suggestions as to what our section of the Communist Party could do.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you sent there by someone else in the party?
Miss KINNEY. Our section committee decided this would be a good idea. Nothing came of it. I mean we didn't really do anything to help the conference.
Mr. WHEELER. Did your section committee consider Carey McWilliams as sympathetic to the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Not particularly. Carey McWilliams, I think they considered him as a progressive member of Governor Olsen's administration. This was a case of the party trying to horn in on something.
Mr. WHEELER. "Two Decades of Progress" reflects that the 63d assembly district was also in the 15th Congressional District. Two branches of the Communist Party, according to this document, were in this assembly district, the 63d Assembly District Branch and the Culver City Studio Branch. What can you tell the committee of the first branch
Miss KINNEY. Sara Kusnetz was a chairman of the branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any of the members of the branch? What type of branch was that?
Miss KINNEY. It was a street branch, and so far as this Culver City Studio Branch is concerned, I have absolutely no recollection of the existence of such a branch.
Mr. WHEELER. The last branch was in the 15th Congressional District, as recorded in "Two Decades of Progress" and was the 65th assembly district. Will you describe this branch 884 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. This was a small street branch. Anya Lieberson was president. Her husband, Eddie Fisher, was a member of that branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you further identify Eddie Fisher ?

Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if Ernest Dawson was a member of the Communist Party in the 15th Congressional District?
Miss KINNEY. Not that I know of.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any person by the name of Dawson that owned a bookstore ?
Miss KINNEY. I know a person in Los Angeles by the name of Ernest Dawson that owned a bookstore, but he was not a member of the Communist Party, so far as I know.

Miss KINNEY. I knew some social workers. There were, I think, two units of social workers in the professional section.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any of these people ? The other day in our interview you mentioned you knew Betty Selden as a member of the Communist Party.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Ruth Ober as a member of the Communist Party?

Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you a member ?
Miss KINNEY. Here in Los Angeles, in the fall of 1940, until the fall of 1941; I never attended a meeting.

Mr. WHEELER. You previously testified that you were employed by the United Office and Professional Workers of America in Chicago. Were you active at all as a Communist in that organization? Mliss KINNEY. Well, I was still a Communist at the time I started working for them. I had dropped out of the party before I stopped working for them.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know anyone in Chicago connected with the United Office and Professional Workers of America to be a Communist?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, there were some members of the union whom I knew to be Communists.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this knowledge based upon party meetings?

Mr. WHEELER. Well, we will not go into that. How did you obtain your job with United Office and Professional Workers of America?
Miss KINNEY. I heard that they were looking for someone to work in the office who knew something about editing a paper, and I had been editing-I had been editor of the union paper at Studebaker and 888 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I wanted to change jobs because the job at Studebaker was very hard on me physically. So I applied for this job with United Office and Professional Workers. They were at that time, that is, the regional office at that time was publishing a monthly paper for the insurance divisionMr. WHEELER. Would you say being a member of the Communist Party was a good recommendation for employment N ith the United Office and Professional Workers of America?
Miss KINNEY. So far as I know it had nothing to do with it. So far as I know, Morris Yanoff, who was the regional director, didn't know I was a Communist when he hired me.
Mr. WHEELER. You testified from the fall of 1940 until May 1942 you were working on the county membership committee, organizer for the 65th assembly district and also for a short period of time county membership director. What were your duties while working on the county membership committee?
Miss KINNEY. I think principally it was a matter of working out methods for keeping closer check on dues payments and transfers from one branch to another.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have anything to do with individuals being transferred out of the Los Angeles district and individuals being transferred in from other areas?
Miss KINNEY. As county membership director, I sent transfers out to San Francisco, the district office, if they were transferring somewhere out of the county.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any individuals that you transferred out of Los Angeles?
Miss KINNEY. No; I don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of any of the individuals who may have been transferred into Los Angeles?
Miss KINNEY. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals comprised the membership, the county membership commission
Miss KINNEY. I can only remember three of us, but it seems to me there was a fourth person. I don't remember who it was. The three I remember was myself, Helen Gardner, and Max Silver.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how long you were organizer for the 65th assembly district?
Miss KINNEY. I think only about 2 months.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone in the 65th assembly district as members of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Only the ones I mentioned previously, Anya Lieberson and Eddie Fisher were the two I mentioned before.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a membership director of the Los Angeles County
Miss KINNEY. I would say 4, possibly 5 months; not any longer.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the total membership of Los Angeles County during the time you were membership director in 1942?
Miss KINNEY. The figure, I think, was 3,000. It isn't necessarily correct, though.
Mr. WHEELER. What were your duties?
Miss KINNEY. To collect dues from the section membership directors, to handle transfers from one section to another within the county, COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 889 assign people being transferred into Los Angles County from outside, to send to the district office in San Francisco those transfers of people who were leaving the county.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the names of the individuals that you received dues from on the sectional level?
Miss KIKNEY. Well, as often as not it might be the section organizer who turned it over to me, rather than the section membership director. I remember some of the section organizers better than I do the membership directors.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you name the individuals?
Miss KINNEY. George Sandy.
Mr. WIIEELER. If you recall the district for which he was an organizer, will you please mention that?
Miss KINNEY. I think he was from the 12th Congressional District. Jean Mayer was section orgamzer in the 13th Congressional District.
Mr. WHEELER. How do you spell her last name?
Miss KINNEY. M-a-y-e-r, I guess. Frank Beye, from San Fernando Valley. Betty Martin, from the harbor. Miriam Brooks.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the organizer or the treasurer was of the northwest section, which comprised Hollywood?
Miss KINNEY. Elizabeth. I don't remember her last name.
Mr. WHEELER. Leech?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. How much money would you estimate that you received from these individuals a month?
Miss KINNEY. In the Hollywood section?
Mr. WHEELER. No, the whole Los Angeles County.
Miss KINNEY. I have no recollection.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you say $1,000?
Miss KINNEY. Honestly, I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall how much money you received from the Hollywood section or the northwest section?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, because all that I received was the equivalent of unemployed dues, which were 10 cents a month. The rest of the dues which they paid were turned in direct to, I presume, the county organizer. The records only showed unemployed dues for Hollywood.
Mr. WHEELER. Did they turn them in to the county organizer or would these dues they collected from Hollywood go direct to the national?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know. I knew that I got only the unemployed amount, and that there was a larger amount which I never got.
Mr. WHEELER. Wouldn't this be considered unusual procedure?
Miss KINNEY. It was not like any other section.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever hear discussed how much money came out of Hollywood a month?
Miss KINNEY. Not that I recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you list all the Communist Party officials in Los Angeles County that you have met?
Miss KINNEY. Paul Cline. You want their titles?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. County organizer.
Mr. WHEELER. And approximate time he was county organizer, which went back to '38 or '39? 31747-53-pt 5--- 890 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. I think from '37 to sometime around-I don't know whether it was '-I0 or '41; I am not sure. Max Silver took his place. Pettis Perry, county chairman. Matt Pellman, as educational director for a while. Part of the time Al Ryan was educational director. Lou Baron, I think, was trade-union director at one time. Helen Gardner was membership director. I don't recall anybody else. 1 think in 1937, just before Paul Cline came, Betty Gannett was county organizer for a brief time. Carl Winter was county organizer in 1942. He came just a few months before I left Los Angeles. I can't think of anybody else.
Mr. WHEELER. Who of the Communist Party have you met that was on the national level of the party structure?
Miss KINNEY. At one time or another there were national committee members who spoke here at public meetings. I didn't meet them personally.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you familiar with the political commission of the Communist Party
Miss KINNEY. I have a vague recollection there was some sort of committee set up at one time.
Mr. WHEELER. I have here a photostat of a card which I will hand you and ask you if it is your handwriting.
Miss KINNEY. The writing on one side is; the writing on the other side isn't.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you read into the record the portion of the handwriting that is yours?
Miss KINNEY. The portion that is mine is the side listing the names of three people. It states they are transferring into the political unit.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you read the names ?
Miss KINNEY. And signed Jane Howe.
Mr. WHEELER. Read the names and also party names.
Miss KINNEY. Dennis Dane. That is Leo Bigelman. Alice Starr, who was Rose Segure. And Margaret-it looks like P-e-t-o-s, who was Elnore Bogigian.
Mr. WHEELER. Was that Mrs. Murray Abowitz ?
Miss KINNEY. Was it?
Mr. WHEELER. For the record, it is Mrs. Murray Abowitz.
Miss KINNEY. I don't know whose writing this is on the other side.
Mr. WHEELER. I will introduce that as Kinney Exhibit No. 1. You have previously testified that in 1942 you became a member of the Studebaker branch of the Communist Party in Chicago, Ill. Will you give us the approximate date you moved to Chicago?
Miss KINNEY. I moved to Chicago in July of 1942. I didn't become a member of the Studebaker branch until, I think, December; transfers sometimes take a long time.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you transferred by the direction of the Communist Party
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have any discussion with any member of the Communist Party concerning your transfer? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 891 
Miss KINNEY. I decided on my own I wanted to go back to Chicago, and when I mentioned it to Carl Winter, who was the county organizer, he said, "Well, I don't know whether we will let you." I didn't like that. I intended to go anyway. But before I left he sent word to me, I think, by Max Silver, that it was all right for me to go.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he disturbed because you didn't advise him prior to the making of your decision to move to Chicago?
Miss KINNEY. I don't think Carl Winter ever liked anyone to make a decision that lie didn't approve of. It hadn't occurred to me that there would be any question or objection.
Mr. WHEELER. How many members comprised the Studebaker branch in Chicago?
Miss KINNEY. I think between 15 and 20, but I am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Were these individuals all employed with the Studebaker plant?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you a member of the United Auto Workers of America?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were any officials of the United Auto Workers of America members of the Communist Party, to your knowledge?
Miss KINNEY. You mean in our local union ?
Mr. WHEELER. In your local union.
Miss KINNEY. Yes, Carl Swanson, Gertrude Selig, and Evelyn Fargo were members of the Studebaker branch, and part of the time officers of the local union.
Mr. WHEELER. What number was the union?
Miss KINNEY. 998.
Mr. WHEELER. To your knowledge is it still m existence?
Miss KINNEY. I am sure it isn't because the plant was closed in, I think, June of 1945, and never reopened by Studebaker.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall any other members of the Studebaker branch?
Miss KINNEY. Reva Handle, Wally, whose last name I can't remember. Evelyn Fargo was the other one. Jane March.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else?
Miss KINNEY. No, those were the only ones.
Mr. WHEELER. While a member of the Communist Party, and while assigned to the Studebaker branch, did you have any specific function with the union
Miss KINNEY. I was appointed to the staff of the union paper in June of 1943, and elected editor of the paper by the staff.
Mr. WHEELER. Did this paper reflect in any way the Communist Party line? Were you under any orders from the Communist Party to slant this publication in any way?
Miss KINNEY. I had some disagreements with some of the members 'of the branch, particularly Carl Swanson and Gertrude Selig, about whether or not the paper would be a miniature Daily Worker. I refused to turn it into that and maintained that it was a union paper and it should follow CIO policy. It did follow CIO policy.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you at that time consider yourself in more agreement with CIO policy than the Communist Party directives? 892 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA In other words, did you place the CIO above the Communist Party while editor of this paper?
Miss KINNEY. It wasn't that clear-cut, but it seemed to me a union paper is a union paper, and that you don't turn a union paper into a Communist paper. I felt I was responsible to the entire union membership for putting out a paper that reflected the policies of the union.
Mr. WHEELER. Yes, but you still were removing yourself from Communist Party discipline, were you not ?
Miss KINNEY. Well, my disagreements didn't make me too popular in the branch. At that time there wasn't too much difference in the immediate policies of the Communist Party and the CIO. If there had been greater divergence, I think it might have created considerably more difficulties than it did.
Mr. WHEELER. You have previously testified that you were a member of the Hyde Park branch in Chicago from the fall of 1944 to the fall of 1945. What was the reason for your transfer from the Studebaker group to the Hyde Park group?
Miss KINNEY. The shop branch was disbanded. All shop branches were disbanded in the summer of 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this because of security reasons?
Miss KINNEY. No, this was during the period of the Communist Political Association.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the members of the Hyde Park branch were ?
Miss KINNEY. Joan Place was the chairman of the branch. Lucy Arnold was a member. Sue Cohen, Morton Nadler. I told you he worked at Dodge. I was mistaken. It was Meyer Wineberg that worked at Dodge.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know where Morton Nadler worked?
Miss KINNEY. No. Jens and Sarah Simonsgard were members.
Mr. WHEELER. Are those all the individuals that you recall from this group ?.
Miss INNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. How big a group was this?
Miss KINNEY. I think it was supposed to have about 50 members. The attendance at meetings was perhaps about 20, at best.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you regular in your attendance ?
Miss KINNEY. I was not very regular in my attendance. I became less and less regular.
Mr. WHEELER. Was this the last group that you were in while a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. And when did you cease to attend this group ?
Miss KIN.iY. In the fall of 1945.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Communist Party at any time give you any special training to assist you in furthering its program?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; here in Los Angeles, in 1937, I went to 2 weeks' county training school.
Mr. WHEELER. Where was this held?
Miss KINNEY. In Ocean Park, I believe, or Venice; I am not sure which.
Mr. WHEELER. How were you selected to attend this school? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 893 
Miss KINNEY. By the county committee.
Mr. WHEELER. Did they select individuals that they thought would make good workers for the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Presumably you had leadership possibilities.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who attended this meeting?
Miss KINNEY. You mean who were students at the school?
Mr. WIIEELER. Yes. 
Miss KINNEY. Helen Gardner was a student and LaRue McCormick, Betty Martin, Bob Cole.
Mr. WHEELER. IS Bob Cole or Robert Cole, the son of Rabbi Cohn?
Miss KINNEY. I think so. lMr.WIIEELER. How many people attended the school?
Miss KINNEY. Offlland, I would say 16 or maybe as many as 20; I am not sure
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructors were?
Miss KINNEY. Jules Carson was the director of the school. Paul Cline, I think, taught one session. Pettis Perry taught one session. J believe Lou Baron taught one session, but 1 am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the subjects that were taught to the students? 
Miss KINNEY. Perry was teaching Negro problems. Lou Baron taught trade-union problems. Paul Cline, I think, taught organization. I imagine that part of the time must have been spent on political economy.
Mr. WHEELER. Was anything of a revolutionary nature taught at this school?
Miss KINNEY. By that you mean-Mr. \WEELER. Anything that you could construe in your mind asMiss KINNEY. The question of the use of force and violence, you mean ?
Mr. WHEELEE. Well, yes. Force and violence.
Miss KINKEY. That is a question that they usually get around, and the party usually gets around that by stating that, of course, the party would like to see the working class take power peacefully, but that they would never be allowed to do it in a democratic way because the capitalist class would always use violence against the working class taking power. The assumption is that then the working class would have to defend itself.
Mr. WIIEELER. Did you in your own mind think that the Communist Party was a revolutionary party that would resort to force and violence here in the United States?
Miss KINNEY. I believed at that time what they told me; that is, what I have just explained. And the answer, if you raised a question about the use of force in the Russian revolution, was that the situation there was different than it might be here. and that there was no blueprint for how a revolution worked.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend any other training school?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; 1 went to a State training school in the fall of 1938 in San Francisco at the party's headquarters there, which I think were on Haight Street. 894 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Were you selected the same way for this training?'
Miss KINNEY. Yes; I was.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who were present as students?
Miss KINNEY. Dorothy Zadow, Jean Richardson, Donald Healey.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state what part of the State they were from, if you know ?
Miss KIxNEY. Dorothy Zadow was from Oakland. Jean Richardson was from San Diego.
Mr. WHEELER. Would that be Baibara Richardson?
Miss KINNEY. No; Jean.
Mr. WHEELER. Male or female?
Miss KINNEY. Female. Allen Yates, a seaman from San Francisco. John Bevins, Emil Freed from Los Angeles. Margaret Wilson, a blind girl from San Francisco. Arcus Reddock, from Arizona; but he didn't go back to Arizona.
Mr. VWHEELER. How about Honolulu, was anyone there from Honolulu?
Miss KINNEY. I am not sure. I don't think so.
Mr. WHEELER. We had some previous testimony about that period of time; a person named Robert McElrath, a seaman, originally from Seattle, attended school.
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember him.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the instructors were?
Miss KINNEY. There was a George McLean, a longshoreman flomn San Pedro there.
Mr. WHEELER. As a student?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. This school was under the direction of Louise Todd, and she taught some of the ehhsions. Betty Gainett taught most of the first 2 weeks. Oleta O'Connor, Jules Carson, Walter Lambert also taught. Most of them just 1 day.
Mr. WHEELER. Does that cover it?
Miss KINNEY. I don't remember, there may have been 1 or 2 others, but I don't recall them.
Mr. WHEELER. Getting back for a moment to when you were county membership director, you stated that you received the dues collected by the secretary-treasurers or organizers. What did you do with this money? Did you place it in the bank account for the Communist Party in Los Angeles or did you turn it over to a superior?
Miss KINNEY. I turned over the county's percentage to Max Silver, I believe, but I am not sure whether it was to Max or somebody else. I recall it as being Max.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall what the county percentage was?
Miss KINNEY. No. And I sent the rest to San Francisco.
Mr. WHEELER. To whom in San Francisco ?
Miss KINNEY. Leo Baroway.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where the Communist Party kept its bank account at that time ?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know that they had one.
Mr. WHEELER. Getting back to the time when you were a member at large and working for Harrison George, I would like to read the following from executive testimony of the committee hearings which have been previously identified: COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 895 In the early part ot 1935, also. I think, I was called in to Di. Tashjian's' office to meet Harrison George, who is at present editor in chief of the People's World in San Francisco He informed me at that time that lie was working out here, had charge of a committee known as the Communist Party Phililpine Committee, which was charged with the duty of rendering assistance to the 'ommunist Party in the Philippine Islands. And on the occasion ot this meeting he asked that I C membersof the party in Los Angeles turn over to him immediately a hst of all who were either Japanese or Flhpinos, that they were to le organized into a separate group over which he would have jurisdiction. At a late meeting, under silllar conditions, they not only discussed phases of the Los Angeles County activity and gave us suggestions as to improving the tempo of our Communist n ork, but he asked me if I could find him a thoroughly trustworthy comrade who could bring some packages from San Pedro to Los Angeles for him He indicated to me he was receiving packages or mail from some of the ships in San Pedro and wanted a messenger to bring them from San Pedro to Los Angeles. Does that mean anything to you at all?
Miss KINNEY NO; I didn't know anything about any packages or anything about any Philippine committee
Mr. WEELER. It was during this period of time that you were acting as a messenger for Harrison George?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. And I thought that maybe you might have been the "thoroughly trustworthy comrade" selected.
Miss KINNEY. No; I wasn't.
Mr. TIIEELER. What was your reaction to the Stalin-Hitler Pact?
Miss KINNEY. I accepted the party's explanation.
Mr. WHEELER. What was the party's explanation given to you?
Miss KINNEY. As I recall, it was that this didn't mean that Russia condoned fascism with Germany, but because of the inability to reach an agreement with the IUnted States and England and France, it took this means of giving Russia longer to prepare for an inevitable attack. That is the way I remember it.
Mr. WHEELER. That was agreeable to you at that period of time?
Miss KINNEY. I accepted it.
Mr. WTHEELER. What was the Duclos letter?
Miss KINNEY. That was a letter written by the head of the French Communist Party, to whom I don't recall, but severely criticizing the Communist Party in the United States for its activity in the previous several years, and particularly for changing itself in 1944 from Communist Party to Communist Political Association, and ostensibly giving up any revolutionary aims for an indefinite period.
Mr. WHEELER. What effect did the Duclos letter have on the Communist Party in the United States?
Miss KINNEY. TO put it colloquially, it threw everybody into a panic and occasioned a great deal of discussion and a great deal of commotion.
Mr. WHEELER. Why? 
Miss KINNEY. Because it was extremely critical and because, apparently, Communists in other countries felt that the party here wasn't acting as it should and thereby, as they put it, betraying the interests of the working class.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you think that the defeat of Germany, Italy, and Japan had anything to do with the issuance of the Duclos letter ?
Miss KINNEY. I think it is quite possible. I had never thought about it. Di Vaughan A K Tashlian 896 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. During the war years that the Communist Party line was in accord with the Government of the United States?
Miss KINNEY. Winning the war was the primary consideration during the war years.
Mr. WHEELER. And actually the Communist Party line never deviated from the Government's position here. There wasn't any great deviation?
Miss KINNEY. No, no great deviation.
Mr. WHEELER. There was 100 percent war effort which the Communist Party backed.
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did the Duclos letter change this cooperative attitude?
Miss KINNEY. Very definitely it did. I recall the idea was that the Communist Party here should forget about supporting the Government as it had during the war.
Mr. WHEELER. During the war years Browder put forth the coexistence policy that capitalism and communism could exist in this world; is that right?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What did the Duclos letter do? 
Miss KINNEY. The Duclos letter, as I recall, said, "You can't have any such equilibrium. Inevitably there is a clash between the two." And the idea, I think, was the sooner the better.
Mr. WHEELER. And Earl Browder was removed as the Communist PartyMiss KINNEY. The effect of the letter was that Browder was removed, but aside from minor shifting of positions, the rest of the leadership remained in leadership, but presumably following now a totally different line from the line that presumably they had all agreed to up until the day the Duclos letter appeared. It was as if somebody had said to a marching column, "About-face," and the column about-faced and started marching in the completely opposite direction.
Mr. WITEELER. It wouldn't be hard to find many such instances in the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNET. That, I think, is the most pronounced. I think that certainly one of the important effects of the Duclos letter, so far as I was concerned, was the hypocrisy and dishonesty that came to the surface at that time. People who had said one thing one day were now saying that this was all wrong and hadn't ought to be and that we should never have done it; we must do something else.
Mr. WHEELER. Well now, did you know John Leech to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. He has county organizer at one time.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know James Thorme to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KTNNEY. Yes. I think he was county, a county official at the time Leech was county organizer.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Morrie Smolan to be a Communist? To be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know he was a member of the Communist Party ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 897 
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. His occupation ?
Miss KINNEY. 1 don't know. He may have worked for the People's World.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Marian Shire as a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I rented a room from her for a couple of months.
Mr. WHEELER. What was her occupation ?
Miss KINNEY. She was a housewife at the time I was living there.
Mr. WHEELER. Was she in a street group or professional group?
Miss KINNEY. Street.
Mr. WHEELER. What was her husband's name? 
Miss KINNEY. Henry Shire.
Mr. WHIIEELER. Did you know him to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KIN N EY. Yes, he was in a street group, too; he drove a truck.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Rude Lambert to be a member of the Communist Party ? Mis KINNEY. 1 think he was in San Francisco.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know William Schneidermann to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes; State chairman.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Mary Radin to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I think she worked for the county office a long, long time ago.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Rena Vale to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I knew her. She was membership director of a branch in the professional section at one time; I don't remember which branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Bea Burke as a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. She was in a professional branch, but I don't remember which one.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her occupation?
Miss KINNEY. No, I don't. If I knew her occupation I would know what branch she was in. I would think she was a writer, but I don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Dorothy Pezman to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. I think she was a social worker.
Mr. WHEELER. You knew her as a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know her husband?
Miss KINNEY. No, if she had a husband.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Zema Matlin to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know her occupation ?
Miss KINNEY. She was, at the time I knew her, executive secretary of the American League Against War and Fascism. That was in 1934.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Fred Franchia? 898 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Miss KINNEY. That is the husband of Davida Franchia. I don't recall seeing him in a meeting, but I somehow knew or thought he was a party member.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Howland Chamberlin to be a member of the Communist Partyi
Miss KINNEY. Yes. He was at one time in the theater-project branch and later, for a brief tune, on the 15th congressional section committee.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Sam Kalish to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I think we discussed Kahsh. He was a PWA teacher, member of the union.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Jack Moore to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. I knew Jack Moore. He was a county functionary. I don't remember what capacity.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Al Heltness to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, he was in the 13th Congressional District. I don't remember which branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall his occupation ?
Miss KINNEY. I think he worked on a railroad, but I am not sure.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Leona McGinty to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. She is the wife of Howland Chamberlin.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Carl Grant to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. He was in the theater project branch.

Miss KIN ,Y. Yes. He was in the theater project branch.
Mr. WHEELER. Was he an actor?
Miss KINNEY. I think so yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Betty Arden to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, I knew Betty Arden. She was a housewife.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Belle Lewitski to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes. She is a dancer.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Benny Goodman to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, but not the dance band leader. He was, I think, in the theater project branch, too.
Mr. WHEELER. vDid you know Leo Selfrid to be a member of the Communist Party
Miss KINNEY. I think he is an engineer or draftsman, or something like that. He was in the professional section.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where he worked?
Miss KINNEY. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Miriam Holtz to be a member of the Communist Party?
Miss KINNEY. Yes, she is a stenographer.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know her as a member of the Communist Party ? COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 899 
Miss KINNEY. Yes. 
Mr WHEELER. You previously stated in your testimony that the organizer for the 56th assembly district was known to you only as Anna: that you didn't recall her last name. 1 might ask you if you recognize this picture
Miss KINNlY.
Mr. WHEELER.
Miss KINNEY.
Mr. WHEELER. That might be a picture of her. It might be Ye-. Would you know her last name if I mentioned it to you?
Miss KINNEY. I might.
Mr. WHEELER. Galkin; G-a-1-k-i-n. 
Miss KINNEY. I think perhaps that is it.
Mr. WHEELER. What periods of time was she organizer for the 56th assembly district?
Miss KINNEY. I don't know. She was organizer when I was assigned to that branch, and she still was when I left it.
Mr. WHEELER. When was that?
Miss KINNEY. That was, I think, December of 1938 to August of 1939. 
Mr. WEELER. Now, can you recall at this time any other individual that you have met as a member of the Communist Party any place in the United States while you were a member?
Miss KINNEY. Ethel Holmstock. I didn't think of her before.
Mr. WHEELER. Who is she 
Miss KINNEY. She at one time was secretary of the China Aid Council.
Mr. WIIEELER. Now, the next question is, why did you leave the Communist Party after approximately 12 years of membership?
Miss KINNEY. That is a difficult question to answer, because disillusionment is a gradual process that begins with personal dissatisfaction-sometimes very vague in character-and progresses to more and more basic questions. It is a process that begins long before one leaves the party and continues for a long time afterward. When I left Los Angeles to go to Chicago in 1912, I had a sense of personal dissatisfaction, that there seemed to be no particular place for me in the pal ty. In Chicago, in the branch at Studebaker, some of this dissatisfaction disappeared temporarily. I was elected by the staff of the union paper to le editor, although the party branch had wanted a nonparty person in that position (with me to guide them). During the year I was editor I had some disagreements with the branch leaders because I insisted the paper not be turned into a miniature Daily Worker but use CIO policy as a guide. When the shop branch was disbanded, I was assigned to a neighborhood branch in 1Hyde Park. My attendance at meetings became less and less regular, and I participated in no activity. I was, like most people, greatly shocked and disturbed by the Duclos letter. It soon became evident that Browder was to be the scapegoat, but that the rest of the leaders would continue in their positions, but presumably along a completely different line. The hypocrisy and dishonesty that had always been under the surface came into full view. Since in Chicago I had never formed per- 900 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA sonal attachments, I could look at the whole thing more objectively and I drifted out without appearing to take any definite position. This was not difficult to do, since there was considerable reorganization going on. The process of disillusionment continues, until today I believe that Marxist theory is based on false premises and conditions which no longer are as true as they may have been a hundred years ago when Marx was developing his theories. I also believe that many things are done by the "inner circle" of the Communist Party of which the average member or minor functionary is completely unaware, and which he would strongly oppose. Democracy, as we know it in the United States, may bring about changes slowly. It may make mistakes and then correct them. It may not seem to have a clear blueprint for the future, but progress is made and the average individual has more freedom and more opportunity to lead his own life in his own way.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you have any records that you may have retained while you were a member of the Communist Party ?
Miss KINNEY. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Your statement will be most interesting to the committee, Miss Kinney. Thank you very much. (Whereupon the statement of Miss Kinney was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Hollywood, Calif. EXECUTIVE STATEMENT' An executive statement, given at 4:15 o'clock p. m., February 17, 1953, at 6400 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood, Calif. Present: William A. Wheeler, investigator. INTERROGATION OF MILDRED BENOFF
Mr. WHEELER. Will the witness state her full name, please ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Mildred Benoff. Do you want my maiden name?
Mr. WHEELER. Yes, please.
Mrs. BENOFF. Stern.
Mr. WHEELER. Where do you presently reside?
Mrs. BENOFF. 160 South Vista Street, Los Angeles 36.
Mr. WHEELER. When were you born?
Mrs. BENOFF. May 30, 1920.
Mr. WHEELER. Are you presently under subpena to appear before the Committee on Un-American Activities on March 23, 1953?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes, I am.
Mr. WHEELER. You are, however, appearing voluntarily today to answer any questions propounded by me?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. You know I am an investigator of the House Committee on Un-American Activities?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. You further realize by giving me this statement it does not in any way cancel your subpena, and it is up to the committee's discretion whether to call you or not.
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Benoff, have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes, I have.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you first become a member ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Sometime in '44. I am sorry, I am very vague on dates. It was in '44, but I can't remember what month.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you say it might have been 1943?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. SReleased by the committee Mildred Benoff wis sworn as a witness by the court reporter 902 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHIELER. The records of the committee show you joined the Communist Party in September 1943. I was wondering if it might be correct.
Mrs. IBEXOFF. No. I may have started going to meetings then, but I did not go in then.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the designation of the branch to which you were assigned?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Mr. WIIEELER. Was It a branch comprised only of women?
Mrs. BENOFF. Just a few women. There was this one mlan, Mischa, with his wife. I didn't have anything to do with Hollywood. This man seemed to have the hands of a working man.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you relate the events that led to your joining the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. When I came out here I started working for Russian War Relief.
Mr. WHIEELER. Will you state the time you came out?
Mrs. BENOFF. We came out in July '43. I joined the Russian War Relief, which was an open and very pleasant organization to belong to at the time. There I met Elena Beck, and she and I became close friends at the time. She was having a good deal of difficulty with her husband. I wi having my trouble adjusting from . very different kind of life in New York City to the life here. I was interested in proving myself as an individual in my own right. Elena seemed to be the one To help me this way very much. She told me that part of my growth, part of my groin g up would be to develop politically. She did her best. She took me to several meetings over a period of time. My resistance to joining the party was that it was secretive, and knowing Max', great resistance to itM1. WHIEELER. By Max you are referring to your husband?
Mrs. BEiNOFF. Yes-and I didn't want to join that. When I did join it was with the understanding it would be an open organization and would no longer be the Communist Party, but was on the way of being the Communist Political Association.
Mr. WIEELER. You mentioned your husband's name, Max Benoff. You brought his name into the testimony, and I might ask in what ways he showed resistance to the Commumiit Party.
Mrs. BENOFF. General discussion.
Mr. WHEELER. You had previously discussed the Communmit Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. Well. when you live with a person over a number of years, even if you didn't nevertheless, you do have views and your views will he discussed.
Mr. WHEELER. Did I break the continuity of your thought!
Mrs. BENOFF. I will try to recall t at atpoint I left off. I was assured by Elena and the others that this would be an open organization, that eventually everyone would be openly known, that there would be nothing secretive about it. I guess I was just right for joining, and this I did. As I told my attorney Mr. Gang, when I did, it was with my full naiii, with the hopes that eventually it was going to be a really and truly open thing. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 903 
Mr. WhIIEELER. Elena Beck was actually responsible for recruiting you into this movement?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes. Actually, when I finally was a member and had gone to these several meetings it seemed to me that nothing really had changed and it wasn't on the n ay to being an open organization. It was just as secretive as before. At this time I was quite pregnant and my husband was facing induction. I was 3,000 miles from home and without a very good help situation, and another child, and my problem was somehow to keep Max with me until I give birth to imy child and could get some family out with me.
Mr. WII:IELFR. Now, do you recall in whose home these meetings were held ?
Mrs. BEX.NFI. 'lThe ones I can recall, meetings in Pauline Townsend's homeAlr. WHEELER. Are those the Townsends wlho live lip in Laurel / (anyon
Mrs. BENOFF. No I was taken by Elena Beck. She would pick me up. I couldn't find my way to these homes again. And Tama Tuttle.
Mr. WHEELER. How about your own home?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Are those the only two places you remember going to meetings?
Mrs. BENOFF. That I can say I remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Who else were members of this group?
Mrs. BENOFF. Pauline Townsend, Tania Tuttle, Elena Beck, Marie Rinaldo, and this Miscla. If I knew his second name I don't recall it. AIr. WHIEELER. Do vou recall anyone else? AMrs. BiE'FF. His wife.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall her name?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mrs. BEXOFF. Mischa is also i nickname in Russia, you know. I don't know if that is any help.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anyone else? 
Mrs. BENOFF. It was a very small group. No.
Mr. WHEELER. How many members would you say comprised this?
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know. A half a dozen all told, I would say.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you only in one group during the time of your membership
Mrs. BENOFF. That is all.
Mr. WHEELER. Or two? 
Mrs. BENOFF. NO, just one group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Ruth Burrows a member of this group'
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet Ruth Burrows as a member of I le Communist Party'
Mrs. BENOFF. No I know Ruth Burrows. I didn't meet her as a member of the Communist Party, to my knowledge.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Ruth Kanin ?
Mrs. BEXOFr. Yes. I think she is Michael Kanin's sister, from meeting her at the Kanin home. 904 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever meet her as a member of the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know Anna Lask?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. You don't know her at all? 
Mrs. BENOFF. No, not at all.
Mr. WHEELER. How about Bea Buchman ?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Dalton Trumbo?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if anyone came in to instruct your group on the theory of Marxism or anything?
Mrs. BENOFF. I think one man. I can't say I recall him. I just vaguely remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay dues to the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Yes. I told Mr. Gang I assumed I did. I don't remember giving anyone dues, or who I gave it to; I just can't remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the leaders of the group, if you recall?
Mrs. BENOFF. It seems to me this man Mischa knew more politically; that is about all. Just general discussion.
Mr. WHEELER. How long would you say you were a member of this group'
Mrs. BENOFF. Several months.
Mr. WHEELER. Five, four?
Mrs. BENOPF. Something like that, I would say; the best I can say.
Mr. WHEELER. What is your estimate of the number of meetings you attended?
Mrs. BENOFF. Oh, I don't know. I would say a dozen. It is hard to say.
Mr. WHEELER. What would be your best guess?
Mrs. BENOFF. I just would assume a dozen. I would say a dozen. That is the best I can do.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party while in New York City ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, not at all.
Mr. WHEELER. After your cleavage with the Communist Party, did anyone attempt to re-recruit you!
Mrs. BENOFF. Elena did, just for a while, when I was still pregnant and hadn't given birth to my baby. She asked if I wouldn't come. By this time I was growing up. I was much more concerned with my immediate problems and didn't have time for that.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Benoff at any time accompany you to any of the meetings?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, never.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Benoff know of your membership in the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. lHedidn't know until I think you yourself told him, and Mr. Gang told him.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have any knowledge of your husband's membership in the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, I did not. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 905 
Mr. WHEELER. Would it have been possible for him to have been a member of the Communist Party without your knowing it?
Mrs. BENOFF. To the best of my knowledge, knowing Max, I would Max is just not that type, he is not say he was never a Communist. 1 a joiner of any kind.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you like to elaborate at all as to the reason why you left the party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. It just seemed to me kind of not grownup at all, contrary to what they say. But, actually, kind of an evaluation of the realities of life, which is bringing up children and facing your difficulties with your husband and adjusting yourself to the society you are living in. And the meetings were really very dull.
Mr. WHEELE. What is your present attitude concerning the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would say the same. I think it is not realistic. If it was, all this couldn't have happened.
Mr. WHEELER. All of what?
Mrs. BENOFF. War, and the things they told you that the Communist Party was doing when they were trying to get you to join, that they were fighting Hitler. I do feel very strongly about that. I am a strong Jew. And to this day that is how I feel about that.
Mr. WHEELER. When you were in it, what did you find out?
Mrs. BENOFF. This wasn't really the issue. They weren't doing any better job than anyone else, and I really found it dull, and it was a waste of a good evening after a while. It just didn't seem adult.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there any discussion about subversion or anything illegal?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. Honestly, if anything, what you might classify as a study group and a very dull one.
Mr. WHEELER. What did you study
Mrs. BENOFF. As I recall now, it was the encouragement to read Marxism. At best I am not a student. And I was very anxious not to bring any material home with me. For a while it was really quite exciting, exciting being with what I thought were very forward-thinking people. When that wore off it was nothing.
Mr. WHEELER. During this time when you were a member of the Communist Party, were you and your husband living together?
Mrs. BENOFF. Oh, yes, we lived together all the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there any discussion between you and your husband as to where you were spending your evenings?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. I didn't question him and he didn't question me.
Mr. WHEELER. What do you think of the Communist Party as it has been operating the last few years?
Mrs. BENOFF. Well, I no longer think it is a thing to belong to. I think they are mistaken. I think their attitude has caused a lot of distress. And as a Jew, it isn't my answer.
Mr. WHEELER. Let's clarify that.
Mrs. BENOFF. Not the answer to my problems. It is not the answer to my problems. .

Mr. WHEELER. Did you join the Communist Party purely on a racial basis?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would say yes and no. I was very disturbed by Hitler and very frightened by him.
Mr. WHEELER. What events fix the time when you severed connections with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. My second child was going to be born at the end of November.
Mr. WHEELER. Of what year?
Mrs. BENOFF. Of 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. How long prior to that time did you cease going to meetings?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would say quite a bit before.
Mr. WHEELER. You say quite a bit?
Mrs. BENOFF. Two or three months, really.
Mr. WHEELER. If you joined sometime in December of 1943, you left sometime in the fall of 1944?
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know if it was necessarily the summer of 1944. It might have been the spring of '44.
Mr. WHEELER. As I previously stated, our records show it was September 1943.
Mrs. BENOFF. I was going to ask you. Elena first started taking me to meetings around that time. I did not join at that time.
Mr. WHEELER. These meetings she started to take you to prior to your membership, in what classification do you put this type of meeting?
Mrs. BENOFF. I would assume them to be Communist Party meetings or study groups.
Mr. WHEELER. Indoctrination course on Marxism?
Mrs. BENOFF. These meetings didn't change from when I was in the party. No one said, "This is a party meeting." The same people were there. They were very charming, very cordial, very friendly people. There was no difference. In other words, you weren't told, "This is an indoctrination meeting for when you will go into the party."
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings of this nature did you attend before becoming an actual member of the party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know. Several, half a dozen or more, possibly. I just don't know.
Mr. WHEELER. The personnel of the meetings did not change at all, in other words.
Mrs. BENOFF. No, not to my knowledge or recollection.
Mr. W rEE.IREa. You have identified every person you met?
Mrs. BENOFF. That I can remember.
Mr. WHEELER. To be a member of the Communist Party.
Mrs. BENOF. That I can remember.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you think you may have forgotten any?
Mrs. BENOFF. Time passes. I have suppressed this a long time. My husband didn't know. I really suppressed this. I know that Elena was my friend and did bring me to these meetings, and this was it. It didn't change in character then, so therefore I can assume it was Communist Party meetings she was taking me to. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. You didn't answer my question. 907 I asked you if there is a possibility you may have forgotten some individuals who may have attended these meetings.
Mrs. BENOFF. I may have forgotten possibly before I joined. But when I joined those were the ones I remember. These I haven't forgotten because it was a very small group.
Mr. WHEELER. How many individuals attended the so-called indoc- trination ?
Mrs. BENOFF. Again it was just a small group. Could it have been more than the actual people you
Mr. VWHFE1.ER. previously mentioned?
Mrs. BENOFF. I can't say that. I can't recall. Possibly there was another person. I just can't recall, to say they made a special impression on me, because they didn't. 
Mr. WHEELER. You, however, are positive you never met Ruth Burrows as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, but I do know this woman.
Mr. WHEELER. Or Ruth Kanin ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Or Anna Lask? 
Mrs. BENOFF. I don't know her at all. Ruth Kanin I met through her brother Mike.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you seen any of the people socially or otherwise in the last 7 years ?
Mrs. BENOFF. No. I saw Ruth Kanin at her brother's home. She came out to visit. That was about all; we had very little in common.
Mr. WHEELER. You said you didn't know her in the Communist Party?
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. I am talking about the ladies in your group in the Communist Party. Have you ever seen any of them in the last 7 years?
Mrs. BENOFF. NO, except, as I told you, if I met them on the street or at nursery school, or something like that.
Mr. WHEELER. You have never had any social contact with them?
Mrs. BENOFF. No, or phone calls or any kind of contact.
Mr. WHEELER. From the time you broke with the group you have never rejoined?
Mrs. BENOFF. I severed all relation; that is right.
Mr. WHEELER. Is there anything you would like to add before we conclude your testimony? 
Mrs. BENOFF. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Thank you, Mrs. Benoff.
