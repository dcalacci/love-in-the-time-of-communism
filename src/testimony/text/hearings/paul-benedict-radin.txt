Mrs. TOWNSEND. Pauline Swanson Townsend.
Mr. WHEELER. Where were you born ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Athens, Ohio.
Mr. WHEELER. Your educational background?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I was educated in the public schools in Athens, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio University in 1929.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you been employed, or is your occupation that of a housewife?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I have been employed all my hfe, practically.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, would you state what your occupation is?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I am a writer.
Mr. WHEELER. You are the wife of Leo Townsend
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Townsend, have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Will you state when you first became a member?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. In the spring of 1943.
Mr. WHEELER. What were the events that led up to your membership?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. We had been interested for many years in liberal causes, such as the migratory workers, relief for Spain. In the beginning of the United States' participation in the war we felt it very important to do something about the war. Friends whom we thought were liberals invited us to lecture groups, study groups. At one of these meetings we were invited to join the Communist Party, and did.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was actually responsible for you joining the party ? SReleased by the committee. Pauline Swanson Townsend was sworn as a witness by the court reporter. 954 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Actually the responsibility is John Howard Lawson's. We went to a meeting at Waldo Salt's house, which had been represented to us as a discussion of current events. John Howard Lawson made a brilliant analysis of what was going on in the world, and in the meeting we were asked if we would like to join the Communist Party, and in a moment of excitement we did.
Mr. WHEELER. Mrs. Townsend, during your membership in the party you were assigned to some of the same groups which your husband was a member of, is that correct ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, but not all.
Mr. WHEELER. It is those of which your husband was not a member that we are interested in. I would like to ask you what individuals you have met in the Communist Party, other than the ones you and your husband met together.
Mrs. TowNSEND. I will tell you the whole history of my membership in the Communist Party. After the meeting at the Salts we were told that we would hear from an official of the Communist Party. We were called by a girl who called herself Marjorie MacGregor. She said we should go to a meeting at such and such address in Beverly Hills. We went there. It was the home of Harold Buchman. There we met Mr. and Mrs. Buchman, of course, and the Maurice Rapfs, Robert Rossen and his wife Sue Rossen, Nicholas Bela, Fred Rmaldo. There must have been others, but at this point that is all I remember about that meeting. And at that meeting I felt unsatisfied and felt that I didn't understand what was going on and I made some comment to this effect, so I wasn't surprised when I was called and told I was reassigned to another group. I was put into a women's group, in which many of these same women were present. In addition to these women, Louis Solomon was billed as our educational director. He did not appear, but he was supposed to. Madelaine Ruthven was the executive secretary. Mrs. Goldie Bromberg was the chairman. This was a group of writers' wives, for the most part. Soon after this group was organized I had a call from Elizabeth Leech, who was the section organizer, accountable to the county organization of the party, who said that it had been decided I should take over the job of executive secretary of the Los Angeles Council of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship. I had been in the party very briefly and I knew very little about the Soviet Union. I knew even less about political organizations. I protested. My husband protested. I said no. Actually, my friends protested. Susan D'Usseau wrote from New York protesting. The reason for these protests was that I was working at the time in the 4th Fighter Command as a radar plotter. I loved it and I was useful and I felt fine about it. The party said, "This is more important." My friends felt that moving me was a mistake. Elizabeth Leech called back and said, "Jack feels you are the only person to do this job." And of course having met Jack in the original meeting and having felt from the beginning that this was the man who knew all the answers, I took the job over the protests of my husband and my friends. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 955 
Mr. THEELER. Who was the actual head of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship in Los Angeles?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. The Los Angeles Council was headed by a Dr. Thomas L. Harris, who was sent out here to organize this group.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know Dr. Harris as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did any functionaries of the Communist Party in Los Angeles, Calif., have any voice in the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Indeed they did.
Mr. WHEELER. Could you identify any of those? 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I was introduced to Dr. Thomas Harris by Helen Leonard, who was a Communist, and had been the executive secretary of al earlier group, the American Council on Soviet Relations. I met Dr. Harris at Helen Leonard's house, having been sent there by Elizabeth Leech. Elizabeth Leech was a functionary.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Carl Winter have any voice in the chapter here?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Very soon after I went to work for the council we established offices and brought in equipment. We had to draw up a program of influencing people in the direction of more friendship for the Soviet Union. Tom Harris and I met several times with Carl Winter in the restaurant at the Clark Hotel at Fourth and Hill Streets.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the nature of your discussions with Mr. Winter?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Vaguely, yes. We told Mr. Winter what we had managed to do so far in the way of organization, what people we had been able to enlist as board members and so forth, and we discussed program in the sense that whatever we did in the way of program would need the support and the assistance of the Communist Party "troops," we called them.
Mr. WHEELER. As a member of the Communist Party, do you think the party itself was instrumental in the organization and the success, of the local chapter ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. In restrospect, I think the Communist Party was completely responsible for the organization of the local council.
Mr. WHEELER. In restrospect, would you say the Communist Party was in control of the local chapter ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you assigned to any special or particular branch of the Communist Party while you were an employee of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. As a matter of fact, I was. I was assigned during my tenure on the board of the council to a special branch made up of people working in organizations devoted to the interest of American-Soviet friendship.
Mr. WHEELER. Was the emphasis placed on the Soviet friendship or the American friendship ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. The emphasis at this time was on winning the war. We were completely sold on the idea that American-Soviet friendship and American-Soviet collaboration were the most effective means of speeding up victory in the world conflict. I- 956 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. Who were the members of this group, Mrs. Townsend?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Arthur Birnkrant, Helen Leonard, Marie Rinaldo, Tania Tuttle, Ernest Dawson, Clara Walden, Mischa Walden's wife.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall anybody else who was a member of this group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. There were other people who met with this group.
Mr. WHEELER. Was there ever a fraction meeting that you attended that was called specifically to discuss the work of the local chapter of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did individuals who were members of the Communist Party but assigned to other branches of the party attend this fraction meeting?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who these individuals were? 1
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I recall some of them. Dorothy Atlas, Ruth Burrows, Patsy Moore, Mildred Benoff, Elena Beck, Edwina Pomerance.
Mr. WHEELER. You said Ruth Burrows?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. S
Mr. WHEELER. When did you cease to be active in the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. In November 1943, after the Shrine Auditorium meeting.
Mr. WHEELER. Did that have something to do with your ceasing to be active in the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. I, as a really naive operator in this kind of business, had involved all kinds of people in this particular celebration. This, as I recall, was a celebration of an anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The sponsors included the archbishop of the Catholic Church, Rabbi Magnin, Bishop Stevens, who made the invocation. Important American political and cultural figures appeared. From my standpoint it seemed a great success. I realized later, after having been called on the carpet by the county head of the Communist Party, that a communitywide acceptance of the program was not important, but that what was said, the content of what was said from the stage was what was important, and the content had not been satisfactory.
Mr. WHEELER. You were severely criticized for the program?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Who was the county functionary who criticized you?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Max Silver.
Mr. WHEELER. Did Mr. Silver remove you from your position or did you voluntarily make an exit?
Mrs. TowNsENI). Nobody removed me from my position. When I had begun this job, as I said, I had done it under protest. I worked very hard for 9 months, producing, with little understanding of what I was doing, several important events. I realized after this extremely well publicized and well attended meeting that I was working in the dark. I didn't know why or for what I was doing this. SMrs Leopold Atlas See p 935 for testimony of Leopold Atlas COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 957 I met with Tom Harris and said I would not work any longer as a full-time member of the council; that I would do what I could as a friend, but I would not work in the office. Very soon afterward my husband was called into the service and I went with him and dropped all contact with my organizational jobs.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you remain a member of the special party branch, concentrating on activities pertaining to the Soviet Union until you leftMrs. TOWNSEND. Until I left.
Mr. WHEELER. With your husband for New York. 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Until I left.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you leave for New York?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Exactly February 12, 1944.
Mr. WHEELER. While in New York City did you reaffiliate with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I meant to. I had a transfer slip which I was told to take to the New York Communist Party. I made one phone call.
Mr. WHEELER. From whom did you get the transfer slip here in Los Angeles?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Marjorie MacGregor.
Mr. WHEELER. In New York did you present it to any particular individual ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I did.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you recall to whom?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Peter Lyon. 
Mr. WHEELER. Peter Lyon is a radio writer; is that right?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I think so.
Mr. WHEELER. Through Peter Lyon were you assigned to any group or branch?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, I was. I was assigned to a writer's group, meeting at the 13th Street headquarters of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of this group in New York City?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Exactly one meeting. 
Mr. WHEELER. DO you recall anyone who was present in the meeting you attended?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. The only people I knew there were Howard Fast and-I didn't know them-I only knew them from reputation. There were Howard Fast and Richard O. Boyer.
Mr. WHEELER. When you received your transfer slip from Marjorie MacGregor in Los Angeles, were you instructed to contact Peter Lyon in New York City ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No, I was told somebody would contact me.
Mr. WHEELER. And Mr. Lyon contacted you?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you in New York?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Four and a half months.
Mr. WHEELER. At the end of the 41/ months you returned to Hollywood?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Upon your return to Hollywood did you renew your activities within the Communist Party? 958 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. We hadn't meant to, but we did.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you transfer from New York to Los Angeles?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO. I had no real affiliation with the New York group. I went to one meeting. I had planned actually to o to many more, but at this point my husband's plans were changed. He was not going overseas as he had thought. We had to make arrangements to go back to California. It seemed a very bad mistake to do anything further with the Communist Party, and I didn't go back to any meetings. I made no further contact with the Communist Party in New York.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you reaffiliate after your arrival back in Hollywood?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. We came back feeling that we should break with the Communist Party. However, after we arrived we found ourselves in the same social groups. I am not sure who asked us to a meeting, but we were asked to a meeting and we went to a meeting, and we reaffiliated with the Communist Political Association.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you and your husband assigned to the same group after you returned?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you continue in the same group?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you identify individuals whom you met as members of the Communist Party?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. In the first group?

Mrs. TOWNSEND. She was the head of the Hollywood Democratic Committee or its successor the Hollywood Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the treasurer of this first group was?
Mrs. TowNSEND. Jay Gorney.
Mr. WHEELER. Now, you were subsequently transferred to a second group, is that correct? 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the second group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. It was a matter of months; I don't know how long. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 959 
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any office in the second group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I did for a while. I was literature director.

Mr. WHEELER. Is Mary Shaw the wife of Robert Shaw ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. I don't think I remember any more.
Mr. WHEELER. Then you were subsequently transferred to a third group, is that correct?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. That is correct.
Mr. WHEELER. How long were you a member of the third group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Two weeks.
Mr. WHEELER. Two weeks? 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you hold any position in the third group ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO. I was offered a position and I turned it down.

Mr. WHEELER. You recruited them into the party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. Were they assigned to any group or unit you were a member of ? 960 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you have occasion to process their membership application?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No. Their cards were brought into our branch. This is Communist Party technique. The cards were brought into our branch; we recruited them. They were voted on there. No one had any objection and they were sent on to the section, and from that point I have no idea what happened.
Mr. WHEELER. But your group voted on their membership ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Not really voted. The cards are presented. If there is no objection the cards are turned over to the organizational secretary, who takes them to the section organizational meeting. I have no idea to what branch they were assigned.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you know of any similar cases to that of the Wooleys?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you testify to that?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. The same evening that the Wooleys' cards were-as a matter of fact, she was not Mrs. Wooley at that time, but Barbara Roberts-and at that same time a card was presented for Reuben Ship.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who presented Reuben Ship's card to your meeting ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. Cyril Endfield.
Mr. WHEELER. That would indicate that Mr. Endfield recruited Reuben Ship ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. He had brought in his application card, yes. Since you brought up the name of Reuben Ship, I now remember that Cyril Endfield was a member of this particular branch.
Mr. WHEELER. DO you have any information of Communist Party membership regarding Henrietta Martin?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. The last branch to which I was assigned, meetings of which I attended twice, Henrietta Martin was supposedly a member. She was not present when I was there, but her absence was discussed.

Mrs. TOWNSEND. I never attended a Communist Party branch meeting with Patricia Moore.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever attend a fraction meeting with Patricia Moore?

Mr. WHEELER. Who else attended this meeting that you recall?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. There must have been 8 or 9 women there. I remember Mrs. Moore, Elizabeth Faragoh, and Louise Moss, who is now Louise Losey, and several women representing union organizations whose names I do not recall.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you attend any special classes set up by the Communist Party for indoctrination?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes, one. Soon after we joined the Communist Party we were assigned to a class in Marxist theory, led by Dr. Leo Bigelman. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 961 
Mr. WHEELER. Where was this class held, do you recall?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. At Dr. Bigelman's house in the valley.
Mr. WHEELER. How many people attended this class?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. From 6 to 12.
Mr. WHEELER. How long did the class last ?

Mrs. TOWNSEND. No.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you meet Max Benoff, a member of the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I have met Max Benoff.
Mr. WHEELER. Under what circumstances did you meet Max Benoff ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I first met Max Benoff when he was sent to Hollywood as a writer on a radio show on which my husband was working. I met him later socially with his wife Mickey. I went once with my husband to their house, to what might have been a meeting of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you and your husband friends of M.r. and Mrs. Benoff?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Not really, no.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever go to their home socially ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Not that I recall.

Mrs. TOWNEND. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you know any reason why you would ever meet them socially?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Outside of the political atmosphere; no.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the purpose of your visit to the Benoff's home?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I really don't.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you remember if it was for dinner?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO; it was not. 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if there were other people there, other than you and your husband?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. There were other people ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who they were ?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. NO.
Mr. WHEELER. You previously stated in your testimony that Mickey Benoff was assigned to work with you in the council.
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes. 
Mr. WHEELER. And that you met her as a member of the Communist Party in a fraction meeting. 31747-53-pt. 5--9 962 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA SMrs. TOWNSEND. I assumed she was a member of the Communist S Party, since she was assigned to work for the council and sent from a certain branch in the valley.
Mr. WHEELER. You knew Mrs. Benoff as i member of the Communist Party? S Mli. TOWDNSEND. I assumed she was a member of the Communist Party. She was assigned to work for me.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mr. Benoff active in the National Council of S American-Soviet Friendship, to your knowledge
Mr. TOWNSEND. No.
Mr. WHEELER. When did you say you severed your relationship with the Communist Party ?
Mrs. TOWxSEND. The summer of 1948.
Mr. WIIEELER. Why did you leave the Communist Party?
Mrs. TowNSEND. I never belonged in the Communist Party. At the very first meeting I attended I was called a disruptive influence. I asked questions and got unsatisfactory answers. Instead of answers I got a transfer to another branch and yet another branch and yet another branch. I worked in the higher levels of the Communist Party activities during my work with the council still asking questions, still getting no answers, and fled. lMr. IIEELER. Do you think the Communist Party works in the best interest of the American Government?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. No I recall one specific instance. I think that the American Communist Party, whether members are aware of this or not, moves only in the interests of the Soviet Union. I recall at one point in 1947 when I felt uncomfortable in the Communist Party, but didn't know quite the way out. I was instrumental in starting through the branches a protest report in which Bob Shaw and I collaborated, which said, in effect, that the American Communist Party had no contact with the American people. It talked gibberish gobbledygook to the American people; that it was useless in this country in relation to liberal issues and progressive issue; that indeed it was destroying Henry A Wallace at the moment, because as we said then when Stalin snuffs pepper the American Communist Party sneezes. We felt then, naively, that the American Communist Party could exist separately from Soviet domination and we strongly urged a try. This report was presented at our branch to the great consternation of some people. A section convention was coming up and it was proposed the report go to the convention, as supported by our branch. The vote was, as I recall, 8 to 5 in favor of taking it to the convention. The opposition said, "Let's hear it once more. We will call everybody and see that everybody comes next week." So the next week 23 people came to hear this report. Also in attendance was Mr. Sidney Benson from the county educational department. The report was read and voted on, and approved for presentation to the county convention by a vote, I think, of 14 to 9, after which Mr. Benson was introduced, and protested. He felt the report was naive and misunderstood the conflicts of the day. Nevertheless, the people who had voted the report in insisted it go on to the convention. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 963 The next order of business was that they elected me as a delegate to the convention to take the report. The report went to a resolutions committee headed by John Howard Lawson, and at the convention where I went as a delegate I waited for its presentation, since it had gone through three readings in our branch and been approved by a large majority at each. At about noon, and in the program of the convention the resolutions had their time, and Mr. Lawson read excerpts from many resolutions, from the 20 or so branches m the sections, and took great pains to denounce as infantile and leftist and Trotskyist the reolution from our particular branch. There was no chance for the delegates to hear or disapprove the material. It was not read.
Mr. WHEELER. Did this cause your final break from the Communist Party?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Yes; it really did. I stayed throughout the day. I protested in my own way during the afternoon. When the convention voted as a body to send Nenuny Sparks to the State convention, there were all ayes but mine, and I was a no, the one no.
Mr WIHEELER. 1Mr. Lawson was against moving the Communist Party in the United States from under the control of the Russsian Government?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I can only assume that. I know after this convention I was visited in sequence by Harry Carlyle, who was educational director for the section, and by John Stapp, who was the section organizer. With John Stapp I had a very long talk about this resolution, which was a 40-page document full of everything I believed, and my collaborator believed at the time. After questioning certain points in the resolution for an hour or 2 hours, Mr. Stapp said, "Of course, if you are anti-Soviet, there is no hope." Suddenly I realized I was.
Mr. WHEELER. What was Robert Shaw's attitude toward the way the resolution was handled at the convention?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. Robert Shaw was not at the convention, but he wrote the resolution. Actually, I would say he wrote the major part of it. We discussed it in collaboration. He wrote the first draft. I wrote the second draft.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you discuss the procedure followed?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. He was present with Harry Carlyle. He was present with John Stapp.
Mr. WHEELER. What was his attitude with regard to the resolution?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. His attitude was completely sympathetic to me.
Mr. WHEELER. IS there anything else you would like to add for the record?
Mrs. TOWNSEND. I can't think of anything.
Mr. WHEELER. Thank you, Mrs. Townsend. (Whereupon the interrogation of Mrs. Pauline Swanson Townsend was concluded.) INVESTIGATION OF COMMUNIST ACTIVTIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA-Part 5 THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1953 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES, Los Angeles, Calif.

Mr. WHEELER. Did you ever review any books for the Western Worker?
Mr. RADIN. I have never reviewed any books.
Mr. WHEELER. Mr. Radin, the committee has in its possession testimony from a former member of the Communist Party who testified under oath that you were in attendance at meetings of the Communist Party here in Hollywood. Is that a true statement?
Mr. R4DIN. I attended meetings which I believe were Communist Party meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you ever a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. RADIN. I was not.
Mr. WHEELER. How many meetings would you say you attended?
Mr. RADIN. Since we last spoke I have tried to pinpoint this. To the best of my knowledge, I attended 3 meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. When would you date these meetings?
Mr. RADIN. I would date them in 1946 or 1947. I measure this by the time I met my now present wife. I have been married 4 years, almost 5.
Mr. WHEELER. What arrangements were made for you to attend the meetings and by whom?
Mr. RADIx. I was brought to the meetings by Joe Losey, who was a friend of mine, social friend.
Mr. WHEELER. How did you first meet Joe Losey ?
Mr. RADIN. I think I met him at a party. I am not sure at whose house it was. I was a newcomer to Hollywood at the time.
Mr. WHEELER. Was Mrs. Losey also in attendance ?
Mr. RADIN. Where? 
Mr. WHEELER. At the meetings you attended.
Mr. RADIN. Yes. COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 967 
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall where the meetings were held?
Mr. RADIN. One meeting was held at the home of John Wexley. Another meeting was held at the home of Leo Townsend. The third meeting was held at the home, I believe, of Jay Gorney.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who the individuals were that were in attendance at these meetings?
Mr. RADIN. To the best of my recollection, the following were at the meetings-I don't know whether all of these people attended all the meetings-Mr. and Mrs. Losey, Meta Reis, Lester Cole, Jay Gorney, John Wexley, Dick Collins, Mrs. Gorney, Waldo Salt, Mr. and Mrs. Townsend, John Weber.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall if dues were collected at these meetings?
Mr. RADIN. I believe dues were collected at the meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. Did you pay any dues?
Mr. RADIN. I never paid dues.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall the individual who collected the dues?
Mr. RADIN. No; I do not.
Mr. WHEELER. Do you recall who was chairman of these particular meetings or who was running the meetings?
Mr. RADIN. No; I don't recall. I have a feeling that the leaders of the group-and I don't remember whether they conducted the meetings or not-were Dick Collins and Waldo Salt.
Mr. WHEELER. Were you asked to join the Communist Party?
Mr. RADIN. Yes; I was.
Mr. WHEELER. By whom? 
Mr. RADIN. By Joe Losey.
Mr. WHEELER. Can you date the approximate time? Was it the first meeting, the second meeting, the third meeting or prior to the time you attended the meetings or subsequently ?
Mr. RADIN. I would say that the 3 meetings that I attended were over a period of about 6 weeks. To the best of my recollection, I was asked to join the Communist Party during that time. I don't remember when.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, if it would be prior to the time you attended these meetings, you would have full knowledge of the Communist Party.
Mr. RADIN. No; it was not prior to the attending of the meetings.
Mr. WHEELER. You say it was subsequent to the attending of the meetings?
Mr. RADIN. It was during that 6-weeks' period, I believe. It was either after the first meeting or the second meeting.
Mr. THEELER. Then you, at least, attended 1 or 2 meetings with full knowledge that they were Communist Party meetings?
Mr. RADIN. Yes.
Mr. WHEELER. What was your immediate reaction to being asked to join the Communist Party ?
Mr. RADIN. It left me cold. I had no interest in it.
Mr. WHEELER. What would be your reasoning then for attending the meeting subsequent to the time you were asked ?
Mr. RADIX. Joe was a friend of mine-I just was not too sure of myself. I didn't want to encourage Joe's displeasure. It wasn't until the third meeting that I knew that I never wanted to have anything to do with it. 968 COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA 
Mr. WHEELER. How did you reach this decision ?
Mr. RADIN. Sitting at this group or with this group, I was impressed by the lack of independent thinking, by the almost automaton procedure that went on. Also that these people weren't at all interested in the same things I was interested in. I have always considered myself more or less of a liberal, and this was not my idea of what hberalism was. This was a rigid unequivocal dictatorship of thought. I don't know how else to put it.
Mr. WHEELER. You realized that every person present at this meeting, with the exception of yourself, was a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. RADIN. No, I don't know; to my knowledge, I don't know they were all members of the Communist Party.
Mr. WHEELER. Well, they have all been identified as such before this House committee.
Mr. RADIN. If you say so. I do not know at firsthand knowledge whether anybody was there in the same position I was.
Mr. WHEELER. I would like to make the observation it is highly unusual for a person who is not a member to attend closed meetings of the Communist Party.
Mr. RADIN. I don't know anything of the procedure.
Mr. WHEELER. But you did not sign a Communist Party card
Mr. RADIN. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. You did not receive a Communist Party card?
Mr. RADIN. NO. 
Mr. WHEELER. You did not pay dues?
Mr. RADIN. No. 
Mr. WHEELER. What is your present attitude regarding the Communist Party?
Mr. RADIN. I have absolutely no sympathy with them.
Mr. WHEELER. Have you made any information you may have regarding the Communist Party available to any other agency
Mr. RADIN. Yes, I made whatever information I had available to the FBI.
Mr. WHEELER. Are these the only three meetings you ever attended?
Mr. RADIN. To the best of my knowledge, yes.
Mr. WHEELER. Would you like to add anything to the record?
Mr. RADIN. I just want to add that I come here in the spirit of complete cooperation and will do everything I can to help.
Mr. WHEELER. But you have not been subpenaed?
Mr. RADIN. I have not been subpenaed.
Mr. WHEELER. This is voluntary?
Mr. RADIN. This is voluntary. Ur WHEELER. Thank you, Mr. Radin. (Whereupon the interrogation of Paul Benedict Radin was concluded.) INDEX INDIVIDUALS Page 890 .. -----------Abowitz, Mrs. Murray ---- _-------.-_.. 924 Alexander, Michael_ -----_____ 941, 958 Allen, Lewis __------853 Amster, Lou ---------898 -- --Arden, Betty ------892 ------___ _______--_ _ Arnold, Lucy -----869 -----------Ashe, Harold --------------- --------------- 869 -------------Ashe, Mildred.. 945 --------Atkinson, Brooks____----------------_ -------956 Atlas, Dorothy (Mrs Leopold Atlas) -Atlas, Leopold Lawrence ----------9-30, 935-952 (testimony) 935 Baker, Professor-------Baron, Lou ----890, 893 -----------___ 894 ----Boroway, Leo--__ Barzian, Ben --------------938, 940, 951, 958 Barzman, Norma-..---------958 .....--------------Barzman, Sol --------959 Bay, Howard --959 Bay, Ruth-- __---------------------- 959 9i9 Beck, Elena -------------- - 902-904, 906, 956 Beck, George 930 Becker, Catherine --------959 Becker, Zara -------------------------871 Bela, Nicholas --------------------927, 954 -----Bela, Mrs. Nicholas -- 928 Bengal, Ben----------___----------944,958 Bennett ---------877 Bennett, Alice ----------------------855 Benoff, Max------------803, 902-905, 961 Benoff, Mickey--------------_--------------961 Benoff.
